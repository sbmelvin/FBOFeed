The Contractor shall include the substance of this provision in all contracts of employment and in all subcontracts hereunder.<BR><BR>I recommend that the Department of State use other than full and open competition for the acquisition of the EMC DMX800 and EMC Brocade DS5000 B 32-Port Switch.The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the CA/CST/TI.  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of EMC DMX800 and EMC Brocade DS5000 B 32-Port Switch.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for the Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.IV&V has a need for equipment that will provide a small scale replica of the current Consular Consolidated Database configuration.  This need is based on IV&Vs task to test all CA applications and systems prior to deployment.  There are tools that this configuration (EMC Symmetrix DMX800 and EMC Brocade DS5000 B 32-Port Switch) offers that is unique to any other equipment that may be used to support Oracle 10g RAC because it offers the same technology as the DMX4 in production but in a very small and cost effective package.  The DMX800 provides the same functionality including command line interface.  Deployment strategies for the IV&V environment will therefore mirror the production environment, hence nothing will be missed during IV&V testing.The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for the justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system.The EMS SAN and Brocade switch are required to effectively model the Consular Consolidated Database (CCD) for purpose of testing database configuration and associated end-user software applications.  This hardware is being evaluated as follow-on replacements for the current testing platform of IBM servers and backup solution.  The EMC SAN and Brocade switch will allow timely shifting between database test configurations that other backup solutions cannot provide, through snapshots of the entire CCD Test Region (totaling close to 800 Gigabytes of data).The EMC Symmetrix DMX800 and EMC Brocade DS5000B 32-Port Switch have undergone test and assessment and will receive final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board.The requirement will be competed as the IT community responds to price requests on FedBid.<BR><BR>

C)  Seller is providing these products via Cisco authorized channels for new equipment Federal sales.  D) Full Cisco warranties will be provided and none of these products will have a negative impact on the warranties of associated system components.<BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the CA/CST.  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the purchase of a Cisco 2960 Switch, Cisco 2851 Router, Cisco Catalyst 3560G, and Cisco GBIC modules, which will form a switch and router solution for IV&V.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.The Cisco Catalyst 2960 24 port switch is a fixed-configuration switch that provides wire-speed Fast Ethernet and Gigabit Ethernet connectivity for small and medium-sized networks. The switch provides 24 10/100-Mbps ports for edge connectivity, enhanced security, high availability, and advanced quality of service.
The Bureaus Systems Engineering Task Team was tasked with evaluating the Cisco Catalyst 2960 24 port switch.  Systems Engineering determined that the product fulfilled the following requirements:
	The switch must provide wire speeds of 10/100 GB.	The switch must provide reliable connectivity between the eDV Web servers and database servers.	The switch must be able to provide port density for the domain controllers and monitoring servers.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system.<BR><BR>The current CISCO switches and router has not previously had any problems; however, the aging switches have been in service for about 6-7 years now and have not been replaced.  Hardware may start failing soon and it is in CAs best interest to be ready to replace the Cisco switches with new switches right away. It could take days to replace a CISCO component, which could potentially mean unnecessary downtime.  The main reason for the equipment; however, is to expand the network. With the amount of systems that CA has, CA is rapidly running out of ports on the network and is preparing for future needs. 
Cisco Systems is a leading network appliance manufacturer and has a proven industry record for robustness, reliability, and functionality. Cisco appliances have been implemented in private and government sectors, including DOD and intelligence agencies. Cisco Systems has comprehensive and rigid testing criteria for their certified engineers. They have continually increased the number of qualified engineers who support their products worldwide. The Cisco Catalyst 2960 24 port switch has been, and continues to be, a key component in many network architecture implementations and deployments. This is due to the success of the Cisco Catalyst 2960 24 port switch in providing network performance, reliability, expandability, functionality, connectivity, and security, as well as minimizing the vulnerability of network systems in Internet, intranet, and extranet solutions.
The Cisco equipment was selected for this purpose because results obtained by the Bureaus Systems Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturers servers indicated that it most closely met the Department of States throughput, processing and redundancy requirements. It has been approved by the Bureau of Consular Affairs Configuration Control Board and has been added to the Consular HW Baseline.  The requirement will be competed as the IT community responds to price requests on FedBid.<BR><BR>

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with Bruker Optics, Incorporated, of Billerica, Massachusetts, for the acquisition of a FTIR Microscope Accessory for an existing Bruker Vertex 80 Spectrometer to be used in the Electronics and Electrical Engineering Laboratory at NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland. 

*** NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A) and (B) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.
(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in --
(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or
(B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirements. (See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (d)(1)(B).)

Sole source determination is based on the need for the accessory to interface with existing software and electrical interfaces in the existing FTIR currently in the laboratory.  The service agreement would cease and the warranty would be void if the accessory were to be purchased from another manufacturer.  Bruker Optics, Inc. is the only known vendor capable of supplying the required accessory.

***Delivery shall be FOB DESTINATION and be completed in accordance with the Contractors commercial schedule. ***

*** As defined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation, (FAR), FOB Destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.  The contractor shall deliver all line items to NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland, 20899-0001. ***

*****The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 Employees.

This solicitation is restricted to 8(a) firms having Small Business Administration (SBA) approved bona fide offices within the geographical bounderies of one of the following SBA District Offices:  Philadelphia, New Jersey or New York.
A BOA is not a contract but rather a written instrument of understanding, negotiated between the PWD Earle (FEAD) and an 8(a) contractor that contains (1) the terms and clauses applying to future contracts (orders) between the parties during its term, (2) a description, as specific as practicable, of supplies or services to be provided, and (3) methods for pricing, issuing and delivering future orders under the BOA.
Use of the BOA will allow the Navy to expedite contracting for construction and repairs at various locations in New Jersey and New York.  The types of work being considered for procurement under this BOA includes new construction, renovations, alterations, repairs, minor construction and maintenance work and demolition projects (NAICS Codes beginning with 236, 237 and 238).

The Navy may place design-build projects under this BOA.

Nothing in this BOA is intended to state or imply any agreement by the Navy to place future contracts or orders with the Contractor or to require that the Navy solicit and acquire covered services from the Contractor only.
Under this BOA, firms will compete on task orders for construction and construction related requirements.  BOA holders serviced by the SBA District where the work is to be performed will be provided first opportunity to provide bids on the work.  However, if sufficient competition does not exist, the area of consideration may be expanded with SBA concurrence.  Each task order issued under this BOA shall constitute a separate contract.
The BOA will remain in effect for a base one year period plus three option years.  The Contracting Officer may open the BOA program for new applicants once a year, or more often, if deemed necessary.  To qualify for receipt of a BOA, each firm shall be required to meet the following administrative and technical criteria.
The administrative criteria are:  (1) SBA 8(a) certification and a bona fide place of business in one of the above listed SBA Districts, (2) be registered in the DOD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database at http://www.ccr.gov/, (3) provide a letter from their Surety verifying their ability to bond and current aggregate bonding and single project limit, (4) be listed in SBA's Dynamic Small Business Search at http://dsbs.sba.gov/dsbs/dsp_dsbs.cfm, and (5) complete and sign DOD Representations and Certifications.
The technical criteria are:  Each firm shall demonstrate the ability to successfully meet construction needs with timely delivery of services at reasonable prices.  Offerors shall provide:  (1) references on completed projects (maximum of three) and (2) qualifications including resumes for key personnel.  The evaluation of an offerors technical capability will be a subjective assessment based on review of the documentation submitted by the offeror.

Firms that meet all of the administrative and technical requirements will be issued a BOA.

<DESC>The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is increasingly using physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models in risk assessments, and is in need of technical support, especially for work conducted within the Office of Research and Development (ORD).  The objective of this solicitation is to provide technical support for the Agency?s evaluation, development, modification, and application of PBPK models to derive health-based reference values.
The US EPA is charged with conducting human health risk assessments to provide decision makers with the scientific information they need to make informed decisions about actions that may be taken to protect human health.  Risk assessment activities involve quantitative characterizations of dose-response relationships for adverse effects following human exposure, and the derivation of reference values for ?safe? levels of exposure that are used to protect the public health.
PBPK models provide a chemical- specific quantitative characterization of a chemical?s toxicokinetics, and if adequately developed and tested, have the potential to replace uncertainty factors when estimating internal dose in different species (i.e., test animals and humans) resulting from a variety of exposure regimens.  As such, PBPK models are increasingly being used in the derivation of reference values either to replace the non-chemical-specific uncertainty factors (e.g., to account for uncertainties in interspecies extrapolation and intraspecies variability) or to bridge data gaps where no uncertainty factors exist (e.g., route-to-route extrapolation; exposure duration extrapolation).  
The Government anticipates award of a cost plus fixed fee term (LOE) contract with a twelve-month base term and four (4) twelve month options to extend the term.  The base level of effort for each term will consist of 5,870 direct labor hours. The Government anticipates including quantity option amounts of 50% for the Base and the option periods, which brings the maximum total potential on the contract to 44,025 direct labor hours over five (5) years.
The solicitation will be issued on a full and open competitive basis; it will not be a small business set-aside. Copies of the solicitation will be available to all offerors on the Internet at the following website: http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd. Interested parties are expected to download the solicitation and subsequent amendments from the website and to monitor the status of the RFP. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by EPA. The anticipated solicitation release date is mid May and the close date shall be approximately 30 days thereafter. Contract award will be made in accordance with Far Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation.  The NAICS code is 541330, Environmental Consulting Services, with a size standard of 6.5 million maximum annual receipts.  The point of contact for this procurement is Matthew J. Growney at 513-487-2029.  See Note 26.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>NAICS - 236220.   General Services Administration (GSA) is soliciting competitive proposals for Multiple Award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for Construction & Repair / Alterations with Design/Build capabilities.  This contract will have eight geographical zones.  The following small business set asides have been established for this procurement:Zone I - New Mexico - 8a,  
Zone II - El Paso - 8a,  
Zone III - Oklahoma - HUBZone,  
Zone IV - Dallas / Fort Worth - 8a,  
Zone VI - San Antonio - 8a,   
Zone VIII - Louisiana - HUBZone.     

The remaining zones will be open to all business concerns. Woman Owned, Veteran Owned, HUBZone and Small / Small Disadvantaged businesses are encouraged to submit an offer.
Zone V - Houston / Austin - Full and Open,   
Zone VII - Arkansas - Full and Open.    

See ATTACHMENT A - IDIQ Contract Zones, with geographical zones outlined.  

Awards will be made by zones within the primary areas.  The secondary contract area is the contiguous United States.  Contractors interested in this solicitation SHALL HAVE A BONA FIDE PLACE OF BUSINESS WITHIN THE ZONE OF INTEREST AS OF THE DATE PROPOSALS ARE DUE, ON OR AROUND JULY 23, 2007.  The IDIQ contracts shall be for one basic year with a government option to extend the term of the contract one year at a time, not to exceed five years total.  THE SUCCESSFUL FIRMS WILL BE REQUIRED TO SUPPORT ALL LOCATIONS WITHIN THE ZONE AWARDED, see ATTACHMENT B -Zone-City Listing; includes but is not limited to the cities listed.  Awardees will also be required to submit schedules for orders in Microsoft Project.  Pre-proposal teleconferences for Phase I will be held in Fort Worth, El Paso, and San Antonio, TX, New Orleans, LA and Albuquerque, NM, tentatively scheduled to begin on or about June 25, 2007.  Please monitor FedBizOpps for more information regarding the scheduling of the pre-proposal conferences.    

Multiple awards will be made with each awardee being guaranteed a minimum of $200.  The minimum ordering limitation per task order will be $500.  The maximum ordering limitation of each contract is up to $10 million per year.  This negotiated procurement will be accomplished by using source selection procedures with a two phase process.  A firm fixed price contract will be awarded to the contractors offering the best value to the Government.  Technical ability is significantly more important than price.  The Government may or may not hold discussions on technical proposals (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)) therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a technical standpoint.  The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.  The Government is not limited to contacting only those references provided by the offeror.  The Government may also consider the offeror's performance on contracts not submitted by the offeror that the Government is aware of, or becomes aware of.    

Phase I selection criteria are listed in descending order of importance:  Factor 1 - Experience and past performance of the prime contractor and key subcontractors on similar projects, Factor 2 - Qualifications and past experience of key personnel.  Key personnel will need to demonstrate a working knowledge and understanding of IDIQ contracts.  On occasion small businesses have been unable to field the necessary trades and craftsmen to handle multiple projects in a number of different buildings simultaneously.  For this reason it is a requirement of this solicitation that prospective contractors submit with their proposals a separate and detailed plan as to how they would staff their organization in order to meet these commonplace surges in work requiring multiple projects to be executed simultaneously in different buildings and locations.  Phase II selection criteria will be Management Approach, including Capacity, Scheduling, and Planning.  Offerors will not be reimbursed for Phase I or Phase II proposal submittal expenses. The Government furnished line item listing in this contract will be the primary ordering source. If the awarded contractor refuses to accept work for any line item included in a delivery order issued under this IDIQ contract the government will deem this to be a material breach of the contract and may terminate the contract for cause, without additional expense to the government.    

Any documents related to this procurement will be available via the Internet only.  No hard copies will be available.  Contractors are responsible for downloading their own copy of all documents.  These documents will be in .pdf (Adobe Acrobat) format and will be available at www.fedbizopps.gov on or about June 7, 2007.  It is the contractor's responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any information or documents in the special notices, the solicitation and amendments, if any.  Contractors can also register to be notified by e-mail of new postings including synopsis, solicitations, and amendments at the site.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.  I encourage contractors to periodically check the site; it is the contractor's responsibility to make sure you have all of the documents related to the procurement.  This procurement is being made under the Small Business Demonstration Program.

The information provided may be used by the USSOCOM in developing its acquisition strategy and statement of work/statement of objectives and performance specifications.     Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response.       The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request for information or to otherwise pay for the information submitted in response to this RFI.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) is requesting industry comment on a draft Statement of Work (SOW) to acquire production ready Special Operations Forces (SOF) Deployable NodeLite(v)3 (SDN-L(v)3) systems.  The primary objective of the SDN-L program within USSOCOM is to leverage ongoing industry initiatives/commercial items in the area of portable Satellite Communications (SATCOM) terminal technologies to satisfy SDN-L performance/operational requirements with a Government funded non-developmental item (NDI)  program.  The SDN-L requirement is to procure up to 1048 non-developmental, commercially available, transit case configured, rugged, portable satellite communications (SATCOM) terminals and associated baseband that provide secure (up to TS/SCI) and non-secure voice, video and data communications to SOF worldwide.-------------------------------
In addition to an INMARSAT BGAN capability, USSOCOM is seeking information on and availability of alternative SATCOM capabilities (e.g., Ku-band and XTAR manpack systems).  These alternative systems will augment and/or replace legacy systems, must provide greater efficiencies and performance and be available to meet the SDN-L(v)3 program/fielding schedule. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The SDN-L v(3) system will be modular in design to provide the system operator the ability to configure the system for various mission requirements.  The SDN-L v(3) will be comprised of a baseband chassis, a SATCOM terminal, laptop computer and ancillary devices.  The systems laptop will be provided as GFE.  The SDN-L v(3) system components will reside in the baseband chassis and will be transported in a separate ruggedized transit case or backpack.  The SDN-L v(3) shall be a rugged, portable, and lightweight communications terminal that is rapidly deployable and is capable of providing simultaneous BLACK, RED and GREY data, voice, and video telecommunications services.  The operator will also have the option of severing the SATCOM, Laptop and HAIPE functions to form a single user, single classification capability.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------Interested parties should limit their comments to the requirements identified in the SOW.  However, any information provided with respect to proposed products should describe how such products meet the requirements stated in the SOW.  All material submitted in response to this RFI must be unclassified.  Responses/comments should also address the following:

1.  An assessment of the associated risks for this program and respective risk mitigation approaches.---------------------------------------------

2.  Name, telephone number, fax number, street address and e-mail address for Program, Technical and Cost points of contact information.---------------------------------------

Responses are to be submitted via email to sandra.ortiz@socom.mil by 1:00 PM on 25 April 2008.   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Depending on the results of this RFI the Government is contemplating BEST VALUE, award with evaluation factors consisting of technical, past performance and total cost of ownership.    The Government anticipates, upon conclusion of source selection, the award of a Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) with a five year hardware ordering period and Contractor Logistics Support (CLS). This announcement is a request for information/comment only and does not constitute a Request for Proposals (RFP).  The RFP will be posted on Fed Biz Ops at some future time.  The NAICS code is 334220.

The salient characteristics of a Reconfigurable Cockpit Base Frame System (BFS) that are essential to the Electronic Warfare Groups (EWG) Manned Flight Simulators (MFS) are: 
a)	BFS must allow for the accurate relative placement, within  inch, of all controls;
b)	BFS must provide rudder pedals that simulate the real aircraft pedal configurations, including yaw control, nose-wheel steering, and ground braking of the simulated aircraft; 
c)	the pedal placement within the BFS must be adjustable to accommodate the aircraft variations and normal pilot adjustments for rapid reconfiguration; 
d)	BFS must include a programmable control loading system that provides force feedback through the controls to the pilot [This control feedback must provide both fixed (user programmable) and dynamic (scenario dependent) control loading thus allowing configuration of breakout force, dead band, force gradient, detents (multiple gradients), hysteresis (force and position), friction, damping, displacement limits, and stick shaker (associated with stall and buffet) capabilities]; 
e)	BFS structure must support the weight and size of actual panel mounted components;
f)	BFS must allow for space for component cooling and routing of power and signal cables;
g)	BFS must accommodate multiple system power components, including power conditioning (to prevent damage by voltage and frequency transients), power distribution and isolation equipment for individual system components as necessary to prevent one components operation from impacting another component, and multiple AC and DC power supplieswith all these components located in the cockpit base frame EIA bays to support the power needs of the cockpit consoles.  
h)	BFS must accommodate at least three (3) separate data acquisition chassis, to be installed in the cockpit base frame EIA bays, and be able to be connected directly with cockpit devices mounted in the side and front consoles;  
i)	BFS position must be adjustable relative to the out-the-window scene display, such that the nominal pilots eyepoint can be aligned to the eyepoint of the out-the-window scene;
j)	BFS must be separable from the out-the-window scene generation system (visual system), to allow configuring any specific cockpit with any specific visual system;
k)	Docking, alignment and locking mechanisms must be provided to ensure the correct alignment of the cockpit structure with the visual system;  
l)	BFS design enables the pilot to safely egress the cockpit unassisted;  
m)	BFS must provide a safety power-down capability to remove all electrical power, and this emergency power shutdown for the cockpit is to be located in and near the cockpit via at least two remote control devices (one for the pilot and one for the operator); and
n)	The cockpit base frame maneuverability is to be such that the cockpit is readily moveable, requiring no more than four (4) persons;  
o)  BFS must meet current F-35/Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) Program flight simulator
       requirements in support of the current A.4 Program Introduction Document;
p)   BFS must incorporate the Virtual Input/Output System to provide rapid  
     reconfiguration of the flight simulator cockpit, both with and without the primary  
     host simulation system;
q)	Virtual I/O System must provide digital and analog input/output capabilities and 
       electronically connect to all the appropriate cockpit instruments and controls;
r)	Virtual I/O System Software must be easily reprogrammed to interface with any aircraft cockpit configuration and any simulation software to support MFS requirements;

<DESC><p>Lyme disease, caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, and transmitted by the black-legged tick, Ixodes scapularis, is the most commonly reported vector-borne disease in the United States. Although chemical pesticides and repellents are available to combat these disease transmitting pests, many citizens are hesitant about the use of these pesticides due to concerns about short range toxicity and long range health problems attributed to these chemicals. DVBID scientists have developed host-targeted methods of controlling disease vectors thereby reducing populations of infected rodent reservoirs and questing ticks. Development of new, environmentally safe vector-control methods is a very high priority for DVBID and CDC. Because these DVIBD patented, host-targeted bait boxes and other host-targeted technologies use such small amounts of pesticides enclosed in a box, they provide an especially eco-friendly method of vector-borne disease control in a residential setting. The latest development of host-targeted technologies comes as a new adaptation to the bait box technology. Initial studies were performed in DVBID laboratories. A novel doxycycline hyclate impregnated bait formulation was shown to be efficacious in preventing tick-transmitted B. burgdorferi infection as well as providing a cure for early established infection in a murine model of Lyme borreliosis. In addition, this doxycycline bait formulation, encompassing a bacteriostatic drug, demonstrated the unexpected result of clearing spirochete infection in feeding ticks. These data provide evidence for exploring alternative techniques to prevent transmission of Lyme disease spirochetes. These studies were performed at CDC, DVBID and have been accepted for publication in the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to issue a sole source purchase order as a follow-on to a 2007 project to accomplish the following two projects: Project 1: To evaluate doxycycline hyclate impregnated rodent bait in a palatable formulation. The doxycycline bait will need to be formulated at 500 mg/Kg based on soon-to-be-published DVBID laboratory studies. The doxycycline bait will be made available to rodents and delivered in a childproof rodent bait box to determine the ability of this formulation to prophylactically protect mice, cure infected mice, and clear ticks feeding on treated mice of the spirochete that causes Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi, and the agent, Anaplasmosis phagocytophilum in Peromyscus leucopus, Tamias striatus, Sciurus carolinensis, and Blarina brevicauda, the primary reservoirs of these two vector-borne diseases. Project 2: To evaluate the ability of modified Maxforce Tick Management System (TMS) bait boxes that contain the acaricide fipronil and are retrofitted with Doxycycline hyclate proprietary rodent baits formulated at 500 mg/Kg. Bait boxes will be serviced weekly. The ability of this dual system bait box to prophylactically protect mice, cure infected mice, and clear ticks feeding on treated mice with the use of doxycycline bait and the ability of fipronil-treated wicks to kill ticks on rodent hosts and to significantly decrease overall populations of questing ticks that transmit the spirochete that causes Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi, and the agent, Anaplasmosis phagocytophilum in Peromyscus leucopus, Tamias striatus, Sciurus carolinensis, and Blarina brevicaud, the primary reservoirs of these two vector-borne diseases will be determined. Research shall take place in two residential areas located in Perrineville and NWS Earle, NJ (one treatment area and one untreated control area).</p>
<p>The vendor shall furnish all labor, materials and equipment necessary to evaluate the efficacy of doxycycline hyclate palatable rodent baits formulated at 500 mg/Kg. This will include but is not limited to all necessary equipment to perform rodent reservoir and questing tick evaluations. The vendor will need to have access to suitable tick/rodent/Lyme disease habitat with a minimum of 0.1 tick/m2 and adequate species of Peromyscus leucopus, Tamias striatus, Sciurus carolinensis, and Blarina brevicauda. The vendor shall furnish all labor, materials, processing equipment, live mammalian traps (Sherman and Tomahawk), bait boxes, and equipment necessary to evaluate the efficacy of doxycycline impregnated rodent bait to reduce infected rodent reservoirs and infected questing ticks in residential areas. The vendor will identify suitable test plots for each study, conduct weekly pre- and post-treatment flagging and trapping of animals in plots to determine the ability of these host-targeted technologies to kill ticks, reduce infected reservoirs, and reduce the risk of tick-borne diseases. Vendor will provide weekly reports and perform statistical analysis. All data will be sent to CDC/NCID/DVBID, Fort Collins, CO. All laboratory and field work should be performed under GLP guidelines for future FDA/EPA registration. Animal work will need to be performed under an approved IACUC protocol so the data can be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.</p>
<p>CDC believes that this requirement is met by only one provider. This procurement will be processed under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 and 6.302-2. Only one responsible source and no other sources will satisfy agency requirements. No solicitation is being issued. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. This procurement is not set-aside for small business. For contractual questions contact Linda M. Young.</p>

<a href="mailto:james.m.jackson2@us.army.mil">US Army C-E LCMC Acquisition Center - DAAB07</a>
<DESC>Request For Information (RFI)<BR>Phoenix Network<BR>Overview.  The Government is seeking information on integrating an airborne, wide band network into an existing network infrastructure.  This Phoenix network must have the capacity and extensibility to create a teleport-like capability similar to that used to support the evolving Transformational Communications Satellite (TSAT) network.  This system, however, will provide a widely distributed network of Ground Entry Points (GEP) that connect to aircraft using line of sight (LOS) communications built around the family of Common Data Link (CDL) waveforms defined in the CDL Waveform Specification, Revision G (CDL Rev G).<BR>Detailed Description.  This Phoenix Network is anticipated to include between 50-100, strategically located GEPs across the Continental United States (CONUS).  These GEPs would be integrated with an existing terrestrially based, networking infrastructure.  This infrastructure must include T-3 based connectivity for each GEP and connect the GEPs localized, airborne, CDL Rev G network to the Defense Information System Network (DISN).  The mission of the Phoenix Network will be to provide wideband Internet Protocol transport services to airborne platforms traveling the CONUS including access to DISN networks and services.  These DISN networks would include but are not limited to the Secret (formerly Secure) Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET), Unclassified but sensitive Internet Protocol Router Network (formerly  Non-secure...  but still described as NIPRNET), and the Joint World-wide Intelligence Communications System (JWICS).<BR>Expected Users.  Phoenix will support a variety of government customers in pursuit of senior civilian, military, and local government missions and objectives.  This could include support to National and Military Leadership traveling across the country in aircraft like the VC-25, E-4 or VC-37.  Additionally, Joint Military Command and Control, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance aircraft like the U-2, Global Hawk, or AWACS (if CDL equipped in the future) may either interface directly with Phoenix or form a network with other participating platforms that are within line of sight of each other and at least one of which is in line of sight of a GEP tied to the Phoenix Network.  In addition to supporting traveling government officials and their staffs, Phoenix may also support Homeland Defense, Disaster Relief, Counter-terrorism, Border Enforcement, Law Enforcement, and other missions to include training.<BR>Overarching Requirements:<BR>GEP Deployment.  Assumed to be widely dispersed throughout the CONUS to provide between 1-3 simultaneous connections and provide at least 95% coverage for the CONUS.<BR>Information Assurance.  Phoenix shall be a secure network that connects to discreet networks using Multiple Independent Levels of Security (MILS) through NSA approved High speed Advanced IP Encryption (HAIPE) devices.<BR>Network Management.  This is the main focus are of this RFI.  Respondents should providedetailed descriptions of their proposal to adapt an existing terrestrial network to interface with an airborne, CDL Rev G network.  This must include how the network operations center (NOC) would interact with both the GEPs and the airborne network connected through CDL Rev G.  The overarching objective here is to minimize development and expedite fielding by using existing infrastructure including NSA approvals and certifications for highly secure data transport and an existing NOC.  While suggesting changes to CDL Rev G physical signals and space (often referred to as layers one and two of Open Systems Interconnection Basic Reference (OSI) Model) are not appropriate for response, the government is open to suggested changes in layers three through (especially) seven.  In particular, the government understands that the CDL RF Network Agent, a layer seven mesh network management application, may require modification to interface with a NOC that may provide overriding, policy based direction to control network entry, exit and other critical net management tasks.  Additionally, the government expects to see suggestions on crypto key management for a CONUS-wide deployment of CDL Rev G that may require modifications to the terminal employment in such a network compared to the more tactically oriented missions they were designed to support.<BR>Extensibility to Out of CONUS (OCONUS).  Respondents should provide some concept of how the Phoenix Network could be expanded to DISN sites overseas and how their proposal can support this effort.  This should not factored into the cost estimate,  but provide some insight as to how this could work for Alaska, Hawaii, and strategic locations throughout the world in support of Combatant Commanders (e.g., PACOM, EUCOM, AFRICACOM, SOCOM, USFK, etc).<BR>RFI Administrative Information<BR><BR>This sources sought notice is for planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids/proposals. Solicitation number W15P7T-08-R-P621 is for tracking purposes only. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this sources sought announcement. Responses will assist the Government in determining whether to set-aside/restrict competition in some way or solicit offers from all responsible sources. All respondents are required to complete the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) process to be considered eligible for any potential Department of Defense contracts. CCR registration information can be obtained at http://www.ccr.gov/. Responses to this notice must be provided no later than 4pm EDT, 28 April 2008. Respondents may submit their interest and ability to satisfy the Governments requirement via email to the point of contact listed below. Responses must be no longer than three (3) pages in length and should include a description of capabilities, technical expertise, and relevant past experience.<BR><BR>Information is preferred in soft-copy form in either Microsoft Word and/or Microsoft PowerPoint.  If a soft-copy cannot be provided, written information will be accepted.  Information may be provided through mail, or via e-mail.  Telephone nor emailrequests for additional information will not be honored.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation announcement and this notice does not constitute any commitment by the Government.<BR><BR>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Mobile District, is conducting a market survey to identify sources and to increase competition acquisition opportunities for Standardized Ladder Climbing Devices.  <BR><BR>The purpose of this Market Research and Sources Sought Notice is to obtain information on ladder climbing devices offering full compatibility and interoperability with existing fall arrest systems at Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC), Arnold AFB, TN.  In the interest of safety and efficiency, AEDC is standardizing the ladder safety climb devices used throughout the installation.   New ladder climbing devices shall be fully (100%) compatible with the existing base-wide for AEDC, which is LAD-SAF Flexible Cable manufactured by DBIS/SALA, and shall also comply with OSHA 29 CFR 1926.501, 29 CFR 1926.502, and ANSI A14.3.  The components of these fall arrest or ladder climb devices consist of several key components which must work together.   Cables with guides are installed permanently to the ladder and a removable sleeve with locking device slides up or down the cable.  The worker attached their harness to the sleeve and any slipor fall is stopped by the locking action of the sleeve and locking device.  Since the sleeve is removable it is protected from weather and can be inspected along with the fall protection harness.  Should the worker fall, rescue is much simpler because theworker is already equipped with a harness.  The sleeve must be fully compatible with the cable or the system will not work.  Standardization with one fully compatible system has great advantage.  It provides reduced needs for training because only one system is being used; there is only one method for use and one inspection requirement.  There is greater confidence among workers because they can practice and train on the system they are going to use.   Standardization results in reduced inventory, every sleeve fits every rail, and greater accessibility thereby ensuring greater use by our workers.    <BR><BR>Firms interested in being considered shall provide manufacturers name, product data and written statement of compatibility.  The written statement of compatibility shall include necessary backup information and support documentation.  The results of this synopsis will be considered to be in effect for a period of one year from the date of publication of this notice.     <BR><BR>The government will not pay for any material provided in response to this synopsis nor return the data provided.  This is not a request for offers.  A determination not to compete this proposed procurement based on response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. <BR><BR>Responses should be submitted via email to CESAM-MRCCPlansroom@usace.army.mil.  You may also mail submittals or send overnight courier to U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Mobile District, 109 St. Joseph Street, Mobile, AL 36602-3620.  Submittals are due no later than 28 April 2008.  Submittals will not be returned.  Telephonic responses will not be honored.  This is not a Request for Proposals, only a Request for Information.  No award will result from this Sources Sought.  <BR>

<DESC>Tahoe Yellow Cress FBO Announcement


The Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit of the U.S. Forest Service anticipates awarding a non-competitive contract to BMP Ecosciences for the continuation of the implementation of the Conservation Strategy for the Tahoe Yellow Cress (Rorippa subumbellata) (Pavlik et al. 2002).  The strategy outlines goals and objectives intended to facilitate recovery of Tahoe yellow cress, improve populations, and guide management and conservation activities to secure its survival into the future and to prevent the need to list the species under the Federal Endangered Species Act and allow the States of Nevada and California to downlist or delist this species under their respective endangered species acts.

The program of work is a continuation of activities performed by BMP Ecosciences that commenced in 2000 with the drafting of the strategy, followed by implementation in 2003, which included collection of seed, oversight of nursery activities (propagation and maintenance), experimental design and implementation of mitigation studies, continued implementation and monitoring of outplanting/translocation studies, continued water relations study, development of a survey protocol that will detect a sustainable metapopulation dynamic, and fulfilling reporting requirements as specified under the strategy.  Implementation is expected to continue through 2010.

The key management questions and research and adaptive management framework for Tahoe yellow cress were also developed by BMP Ecosciences.  They have provided the necessary scientific expertise for the experimental design and implementation of statistically robust studies on the ground.  

Vendors believing they can meet this requirement must submit written information showing clearly that they are able to meet the requirements stated above.  All information must be received no later than 2 pm PST, 4/28/08.  Mail to 631 Coyote Street, Nevada City, CA  95959, attention:  Contracting, or FAX to (530) 478-6126.

<p>Special Instructions/Provisions:</p>
<p>The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors apply.<br /><br />The provision at 52.212-2 Commercial Items and Evaluation - Commercial Items apply.</p>
<p>The provision at 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items apply.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999)<br />A. The Government will award a contract resulting from this Request for Quote (RFQ) to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the RFQ will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. An award will be made on the basis of past performance and price with past performance as more important than price.</p>
<p>The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>Price Proposal:<br />Pricing information shall be submitted in accordance with this (RFQ) in the appropriate spaces for each line item.</p>
<p>Past Performance:</p>
<p>Each offeror will be evaluated on their performance under existing and prior contracts for similar work. Performance information will be used for both responsibility determinations and as an evaluation factor against which offeror's relative ranking will be compared to assure best value to the government. The government may contact other references than those identified by the offeror and the information received will be used in the evaluation of the offeror's past performance.</p>
<p>a.) All Offerors shall submit a separate record of the past performance information as requested below as along with this RFQ packet. The information may be submitted prior to other parts of the proposal in order to assist the Government in commencing past performance evaluations. The offeror should include the last three (3) contracts completed during the past three years and all or at least three (3) contracts currently in process for both the offeror and for all proposed major subcontractors, which are similar in nature to this requirement.</p>
<p>1.) The Contracts listed may include those with the Federal Government, agencies of state and local governments and commercial customers, which are of similar scope, magnitude, relevance, and complexity to this requirement. Offerors that are newly formed entities without prior contracts should list contracts and subcontracts as required above for predecessor companies, corporate officers, or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement. The following information should be included for each contract listed:</p>
<p>1. Name of Contracting Organization;<br />2. Contract Number;<br />3. Brief description of relevance to the services required under this RFP;<br />4. Names, addresses, telephone numbers, e-mail address (if known) and facsimile numbers of the Contracting Officer and the Project Officer for all Government contracts. Names, addresses, telephone numbers, and facsimile numbers of private sector contacts equivalent of a Federal Government Contracting Officer and Project Officer (operation manager);<br />5. The dollar value of the contract;<br />6. Contract type (Firm-fixed price, cost-plus-fixed-fee, etc.);<br />7. Period of Performance;<br />8. Place of performance;</p>
<p>b.) Offerors should not provide general information on their performance on the identified contracts and subcontracts. General performance information will be obtained from references.<br /><br />1.) Offerors may provide information on problems encountered and corrective actions taken on the identified contracts and subcontracts.</p>
<p>2.) References that may be contacted by the Government include the contracting officer, program manager/project officer, or the administrative officer identified above.<br /><br />3.) If no response is received from a reference, the Government will make an attempt to contact another reference identified by the offeror, to contract a reference not identified by the offeror, or to complete the evaluation with those references who responded. The Government shall consider the information provided by the references, and may also consider information obtained from other sources, when evaluating an offeror's past performance.</p>
<p>4.) Attempts to obtain responses from references will generally not go beyond two telephonic messages and/or written requests from the Government, unless otherwise stated in the solicitation. The Government is not obligated to contact all of the references identified by the Offeror.</p>
<p>c.) If negative feedback is received from an offeror's reference, the Government will compare the negative response to the responses from the offeror's references to note differences. A score will be assigned appropriately to the offeror based on the information. The offeror will be given the opportunity to comment, if that information makes a difference in the Government's decision to include the offeror in or exclude the offeror from the competitive range. Any past performance deficiency or significant weakness will be discussed with offerors in the competitive range during discussions. The Government reserves the right to award without discussions.</p>
<p>d.) Offerors must send Client Authorization Letters (see Attachments) to assist in the timely processing of the past performance evaluation. Offeror's are encouraged to consolidate requests whenever possible (i.e., if the same reference has several contracts, send that reference a single notice citing all applicable contracts). Offerors may send Client Authorization Letter electronically to references with copies forwarded to the contracting officer.</p>
<p>1.) If an offeror has no relevant past performance history, an offeror must affirmatively state it possesses no relevant past performance history.</p>
<p>2.) Client Authorization Letters should be mailed or e-mailed to individual references as early as possible, but no later then five (5) working days after proposal submission. The offeror should forward a copy of the Client Authorization Letter to the contracting officer simultaneously with mailing references.</p>
<p>e.) Past performance information will be used for both responsibility determination and as an evaluation factor for award. The Past Performance Questionnaire (see Attachments) will be used to collect information on an offerors past performance under existing and prior contracts/subcontract for services similar in scope, magnitude, relevance, and complexity to this requirement in order to evaluate offerors consistent with the past performance evaluation set forth below. References other than those identified by the offeror may be contacted by the Government and used in the evaluation of the offeror's past performance. Evaluation of past performance information will be reflected in terms of the following degrees of performance assessment:</p>
<p>+4 Excellent: A significant majority of the sources of information are consistently firm in stating that the offeror's performance was superior and that they would unhesitatingly do business with the offeror again. Complaints are negligible or unfounded. No doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the Government's requirements as stated in the RFQ.</p>
<p>+3 Good: Most sources of information state that the offeror's performance was good, better than average, etc., and that they would willingly do business with the offeror again. Complaints, though perhaps well-founded, are few and relatively minor. Little doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the Government's requirements as stated in the RFQ.</p>
<p>+2 Neutral: Either no past performance history exists for the corporation, predecessor companies, key personnel, or major/critical subcontractors, or the offeror's record of past performance was neither predominantly favorable nor unfavorable. Sources of information are roughly divided over the quality of the offeror's performance. While some state that they would do business with the offeror again, others are doubtful or would not. Complaints are balanced by reports of good work. There is no performance record for the offeror.</p>
<p>+1 Marginal: Many sources of information made unfavorable reports about the offeror's performance and either express serious doubts about doing business with the offeror again or state that they would refuse to do so. However, there are some favorable reports, and some sources of information indicate that they would do business with the offeror again. There are many significant, serious, and well-founded complaints, but there are some reports of very good performance. Some doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the Government's requirements as stated in the RFQ.</p>
<p>+0 Poor: A significant majority of sources of information are consistently firm in stating that the offeror's performance was entirely unsatisfactory and that they would not do business with the offeror again under any circumstances. Customer complaints are substantial or numerous and are well-founded. The offeror either has presented no persuasive evidence of having taken appropriate corrective action that will guard against such conduct in the foreseeable future, or it appears unlikely that the corrective action will be effective. Serious doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the Government requirements as stated in the RFQ.</p>
<p>f.) Any information collected concerning an offeror's past performance will be maintained in the official contract file.</p>
<p>g.) In accordance with FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv), offerors without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.</p>
<p><br />B. Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>C. A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>Offerors must include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items, with its offer. All Offerors must be registered in CCR and have Annual Representations and Certifications complete on the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) as part of the proposal submission process. All prospective contractors submitting an offer in response to the subject solicitation must go to https://orca.bpn.gov/ in order to add or update its ORCA record. <br />(End)</p>

<p>Security Clearance Requirements (Jul 1999)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions.</p>
<p>"Employees" means both contractor and subcontractor employees unless otherwise noted:</p>
<p>The phrase "CDC owned or leased facilities" includes ATSDR, NIOSH/PRC/Pittsburgh, Pa.; NIOSH/Morgantown, W.V.; NIOSH/SRC/Spokane, Wa.; NIOSH/Cincinnati, Ohio; NCHS/Research Triangle Park, N.C.; NCHS/Hyattsville, Md. NCID/Fort Collins, Colorado; NCID/Anchorage, Alaska, and NCID/San Juan, Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>(b) General</p>
<p>All contract employees who will be performing work under this contract on-site (i.e., in a CDC owned or leased facility) for a period exceeding 90 days in duration (45 days if employee is designated to work in Building 10, 15, or 17 at 1600 Clifton Road, Atlanta, GA, or at CDC's Lawrenceville, GA facility) shall receive a favorable suitability determination prior to reporting to work at an on-site facility. Any contract employee(s) who cannot obtain a favorable suitability determination, will not be permitted to work at an on-site facility (see paragraph B below on temporary determinations.)</p>
<p>The Contractor shall be responsible for managing its workforce to ensure that sufficient contract employees who meet all suitability requirements are available to perform the duties required under the contract. New or replacement contract employees must have previously received a favorable suitability determination in sufficient time to perform work at an on-site facility under the contract. If it has been over one (1) year since a contract employee has worked in a position on a Federal contract for which a security clearance was required, a new National Agency Check and Inquiry (NACI) must be obtained.</p>
<p>(c) Temporary Determinations/Clearances</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer may, as appropriate, authorize and grant temporary suitability determinations to contract employees. However, the granting of a temporary determination shall not be considered as assurance that full clearance will follow. The granting of a temporary determination shall not prevent, preclude or bar the withdrawal or termination of any temporary determination. Prior to the Government's issuance of a temporary determination, the Contractor shall obtain and provide to the Contracting Officer a state-wide criminal records check for all on-site contract employees. The Contractor shall also obtain and provide to the Contracting Officer a state-wide motor vehicle violations check for any contract employee required to operate a motor vehicle as part of their duties under the contract at an on-site facility. All criminal record checks and motor vehicle violation checks shall cover a twelve (12) month period beginning twelve (12) months prior to the date of the contract award. Criminal record checks and motor vehicle violation checks may be obtained through local state, county or city law enforcement agencies at contract employee's place of residence. Where state-wide criminal record and motor vehicle violation systems are not available, county-wide or city-wide checks may be substituted. All substitutions shall be certified by the law enforcement agency that a state-wide criminal record system is not available.</p>
<p>(d) Required Information for NACI Clearance:</p>
<p>Unless otherwise specified, the Contractor shall submit the completed forms specified below to the appropriate office as directed by the Contracting Officer not later then 5 calendar days from the effective date of the contract. Items (1) through (6) must be completed by contract employees who require access to on-site facilities in the performance of the contract. Additionally, the contractor shall furnish, on a monthly basis, item (7) (if the information requested in Item (7) is provided as part of the Contractor's standard invoice, no additional submission is required). The Government will furnish the necessary forms to the Contractor.</p>
<p>(1) two (2) completed Forms FD-258, "FBI Fingerprint Charts"***</p>
<p>(2) one (1) completed Standard Form 85, "Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions"</p>
<p>(3) one (1) completed "Declaration for Enrollment"</p>
<p>(4) one (1) resume or curriculum vitae or completed job application form</p>
<p>(5) one (1) copy of the state-wide criminal records check</p>
<p>(6) one (1) copy of the motor vehicle violations check (when applicable)</p>
<p>(7) a complete listing of all current Contractor and Subcontractor on-site employees by name, work location and employer.</p>
<p>*** The CDC, Human Resource Management Offices (HRMO) have the necessary equipment to complete fingerprint charts (FD-258). The Contractor may contact the Contracting Officer for arrangements regarding utilization of the HRMO fingerprinting equipment. The fingerprint charts may also be completed through a local state, county or city law enforcement agency at the employee's place of residence.</p>
<p>Using the required information specified above, a National Agency Check and Inquiry (NACI) will be processed by the CDC through the Office of Personnel Management and the Federal Bureau of Investigations (OPM/FBI) on each contract employee who will be performing duties on-site.</p>
<p>(d) Removal of Contractor Employees</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer may request the Contractor to immediately remove any contract employee from the on-site facility who has failed to receive a suitability determination and whose continued employment is deemed contrary to the public interest, inconsistent with the best interests of security, or is identified as a potential threat to the health, safety, security, general well being or operational mission of the on-site facility and its population. The Contracting Officer may also request the Contractor to immediately remove any contract employee from the on-site facility should it be determined that the individuals are being assigned to duty who have been disqualified for suitability reasons, or who are found to be unfit for performing duties during their tour(s) of duty. Contract employees who are requested to be removed from the on-site facility are required to leave the work site immediately.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer will make all determinations regarding the removal of any contract employee from the on-site facility, except under certain conditions. When a Contracting Officer is not available, either during the day or after normal business hours, or in situations where a delay would not be in the best interest of the Government, or a potential threat to the health, safety, security, general well being or operational mission of the facility and its population, the Project Officer will have the authority to direct immediate removal of the contractor employee from the on-site facility. The Contracting Officer shall subsequently provide the official notification to the Contractor for removal of a contract employee from the CDC facility. When removal is directed due to a nonsuitability determination as a result of the NACI, no further information will be provided. If removal is directed for other reasons relating to specific conduct of the employee during performance of the work, the Contracting Officer's official notification will provide information as to these reasons.</p>
<p>(e) Identification Badges/Cardkey Access: <br /><br />(1) Identification Badges:</p>
<p>The Contractor shall require each contract employee who has been authorized unescorted access to an on-site facility, either through the temporary clearance process or the formal NACI process, to display an identification badge as required and furnished by the CDC. The Contractor shall submit to the Project Officer a completed Identification Badge Request Form (CDC Form 0.1137) for each contract employee who has been authorized unescorted access to an on-site facility. Contact the Project Officer for details on additional procedures, specific addresses and hours of business for issuance of Identification Badges for all other CDC locations.</p>
<p>(2) Cardkey Access:</p>
<p>Unescorted access to certain on-site facilities at CDC may only be gained through the use of a Cardkey. If a contract employee has been determined to need regular unescorted access to one of the Cardkey access designated areas, a Cardkey Request Form (CDC Form 0.834) must be completed and submitted to the Project Officer for written approval. Contact the Project Officer for details of procedures and specific addresses and hours of business for issuance of Cardkey Access.</p>
<p>(3) Return of Identification Badges/Cardkeys</p>
<p>The Contractor shall arrange for the return of any employee identification badges and/or cardkeys immediately upon their separation of the duties at the on-site facility. Contact the Project Officer for location of the depositories for the return of badges. Cardkeys shall be returned to the appropriate Physical Security Activity Office.</p>
<p>(End of Clause)</p>
<p>Minimum Required Insurance (Jul 1999)</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 52.228-5, Insurance, Work on a Government Installation, incorporated by reference, the Contractor shall furnish a certificate of insurance of the following types and minimum amounts which shall be obtained and maintained during the entire period of performance of this contract:</p>

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK
NSF Travel Information System

I	 INTRODUCTION

I.1	 Mission and Scope

The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent agency of the Federal Government that supports basic research and advancement of science by awarding grants to institutions for specific projects.  NSF currently employs a staff of approximately 1200.  Over one third of the staff is scientists, engineers or educators; one third is administrative and technical staff; one third is support staff.  This contract is located in the Division of Administrative Services (DAS).

The scope of this contract covers real time (approximate) Web-based hosted travel reporting and advisory services.


II	TASK BACKGROUND 

Travel management is a significant part of NSFs business.  In addition to coordinating travel for NSF staff, the agency manages and facilitates travel for thousands of reviewers who support NSFs grant-making process.  In FY 2006, for example, NSF processed nearly 8,500 travel reimbursements for staff and approximately 14,000 travel reimbursements for NSF reviewers and attendees of other types of NSF meetings.

Staff and Meeting travel at NSF is not centrally managed; rather, each office within the agency is responsible for coordinating, tracking and reporting its own travel activity to meet Federal and agency travel policy requirements.  NSFs Division of Administrative Services (DAS) administers resources and tools that NSF offices use in travel management.  The services that DAS oversees, for example, includes the agencys central contract with SATO Travel for booking commercial air transportation as well as e-business applications such as the Guest Travel and Reimbursement System and FedTraveler.com.  These applications permit travel to be booked and reimbursed electronically as well as provide access to data for reporting purposes.

NSF has identified the need for more comprehensive travel reporting and analysis capabilities.   The NSF travel team (which is responsible for administering staff and meeting participant travel at NSF) recognizes the advantages to having access to a variety of real-time travel information to permit the agency to assess and respond more effectively to assist its travelers in the event that weather, airline industry or other emergency situations arise.  In addition, NSF program offices have expressed the need for more complete information concerning cost and other details concerning transportation booked by their invitational travelers through SATO Travel.   

The travel information to which NSF desires to have access is not private information, but is considered privileged with access granted only on a need to know basis.  NSF has identified two primary sets of users:

	Administrator Users  These users will have the broadest access to the travel information system.  Specific requirements for this group of users is described in section  III.2 of this document
	Standard Users  The access of these users will be restricted as described in section III.3 of this document.

The complete description of the requirements for the comprehensive travel reporting and information tool desired by NSF follows in Section III.

They shall not communicate to any person any information known to them by reason of their performance of services under this contract which has not been made public, except in the necessary performance of their duties or upon written authorization of the Contracting Officer.  All documents and records (including photographs) generated during the performance of work under this contract shall be for the sole use and become the exclusive property of the U.S Government. Furthermore, no article, book, pamphlet, email, recording, broadcast, speech television appearance, film or photograph concerning any aspect of work performed under this contract shall be published or disseminated through any media without the prior written authorization of the Contracting Officer. These obligations do no cease upon the expiration or termination of this contract.  The Contractor shall include the substance of this provision in all contracts of employment and in all subcontracts hereunder.<BR><BR>As the Contracts Officer Representative (COR) for the Oracle/PeopleSoft software products used in the Department of States Integrated Logistics Management System (ILMS), I recommend the use of other than full and open competition for the purpose of purchasing software support for its continued maintenance. The Department owns perpetual software licenses for the products -- however software support is a separate expense and represents an ongoing annual expenditure. The action to be approved is the order for Peoplesoft software support obtained through the most qualified provider. PeopleSoft products are the basis for much of ILMS. The PeopleSoft products currently used by ILMS include: PeopleSoft Inventory, PO, CRM Support server license, Object Studio, Balanced Scorecard, Enterprise Warehouse, Supply Chain Management, Activity Based Management, GL, and AM modules. Due to the proprietary nature of the PeopleSoft software, the required software support is available only from a firm that is certified to resell Peoplesoft software support. This software support is crucial for continued utilization of the software in ILMS.<BR><BR>ILMS is the State Department's comprehensive supply chain management system. ILMS has been developed over a five-year period at a cost of over $70,000,000. ILMS is composed of an assortment of customized off-the-shelf software products as well as certain purpose-built software modules that have been linked and integrated with one another, and with the State Department's Financial Management System. In the course of design and development of ILMS for the State Department, the systems integrator selected and incorporated into ILMS the products and support services provided by PeopleSoft USA, Inc. ILMS will not function without these components. Although it would theoretically be possible to purchase and customize software that could replace the PeopleSoft software currently used by ILMS, integrate the new software with the rest of the ILMS software modules, and retrain the existing user base -- such an effort would be time consuming, prohibitively costly and would not shield the Department from an identical need for ongoing expenditures for maintenance and support. Moreover, a decision not to proceed to procure support from would have a significant adverse impact, placing at risk the majority of the software that makes up ILMS. Upon review of possible sources, a vendor will be chosen for software support for Oracle/PeopleSoft legacy software products. Since the services for the same software support were obtained last year, the universe of vendors has remained the same. These support services are necessary to maintain the existing production version of ILMS. The need to have PeopleSoft's technical support for the PeopleSoft software cannot be restated in a way that would permit the use of other commercial or non-developmental items. In the course of the development of ILMS, the Government made a serious effort to assure that Accenture, as the prime contractor, obtained as much competition as possible in subcontracting components of the task -- such as the software licenses and support contracts that it executed. To date, no sources have written to express an interest in this acquisition. When the Government assumes responsibility from a contractor for software licenses and support requirements that are integral to much larger IT systems, it is effectively precluded from competing the periodic renewal of such licenses and support agreements -- particularly if the systems involved have been customized and involve numerous proprietary components. The best alternative available to the government is to negotiate and contract for long-term license and support agreements at the offset.<BR><BR>

14.1 The Coast Guard maintains all aircraft and resources in an Aviation Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS).   The ACMS system tracks and schedules maintenance of aircraft components and assemblies by serial number and part number.   The contractor's responsibilities within ACMS consist of completion and submission of the included Component Repair Record (CRR) as follows:  

     a. A current copy of the ACMS Configuration Report and a Significant Component History Report (SCHR) will be provided with each tracked component. The Contractor shall ensure these reports correspond with the current configuration of the component. All discrepancies shall be reported to the Contracting Officer.

     b. Upon completion of overhaul of the tracked component, the Contractor shall complete the Component Repair Record provided with each component to include Service Bulletins Complied with and other maintenance performed. 

c. One copy of the CRR with the original SCHR should be sent with each tracked component, one copy with the invoice, and one copy mailed to:  

		   Commanding Officer
		   USCG Aircraft Repair and Supply Center
		   ATTN: AVENG/ACMS
		   Elizabeth City, NC 27909

         These forms are considered deliverables under the contract. Noncompliance with these instructions shall result in nonpayment of invoices. The contractor shall maintain a copy of each completed CRR for a minimum of ninety (90) days.


15.0 SERVICE BULLETINS

15.1 All service bulletins if not previously accomplished, shall be identified to the Contracting Officer.  The contractor is responsible for obtaining service bulletins.   Upon receipt of an ECU requiring incorporation of such service bulletins, the contractor shall prepare a firm fixed price proposal IAW instructions listed below.  Service bulletins created and incorporated during performance of this requirement may create new part number configurations, which supersede the previous configuration.  In cases where the old configuration cannot be modified to the new, the new part number may be added to the contract.  The contractor shall notify and request disposition instructions from the Contracting Officer for superceded parts, which have been removed and replaced by new part number configurations.

15.2 Upon receipt of notification from the Contracting Officer that a service bulletin is required, the Contractor shall submit, within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the notification, a firm-fixed price proposal for an incremental charge to be assessed each time the service bulletin is incorporated in a component.  The proposal shall contain a breakdown of material and labor costs including hours, labor categories, labor rates, and applicable mark ups.  The incremental charge agreed to for incorporation of a service bulletin shall apply only to those components into which the Contractor incorporates a required service bulletin, not those into which the service bulletin has been previously incorporated.  Upon agreement of an incremental charge and issuance of a contract modification to reflect this change, the service bulletin shall be incorporated into each subsequent component received at the repair facility if said service bulletin has not already been incorporated.  When service bulletin incorporation changes the Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) part number, the new part number shall be added to the contract.  The same procedures apply if removal of service bulletins is required.

16.0 EXCLUSIONS

16.1 Components received, which indicate obvious misuse, cannibalization, or severe damage due to mishandling or crash damage may dictate an exclusion from the prices specified in the schedule.  Corrosion due to operation in salt environment is normal and not considered to be an exclusion.  Such components shall be inspected, rework costs determined, and authorization to proceed obtained from the Contracting Officer prior to commencement of repair/overhaul.  If the contractor considers a component is a candidate for exclusion, he shall immediately notify the Contracting Officer.  (Verbal notification to the Contracting Officer shall be confirmed in writing).  The contractor shall submit a proposal to cover the cost of the exclusion rework (the costs over and above the firm-fixed repair price) within thirty (30) calendar days after such notification.  The proposal shall include:  nomenclature, part numbers, cost and quantity of replacement parts, and total labor hours.  Contractor shall verify cost of parts with invoices or catalogs, and shall provide a condition report.  The contractors delivery obligation for the component(s) identified shall be suspended as of the date of notice to the Contracting Officer.  The Contracting Officer will (within 30 calendar days after receipt of the contractors written proposal) make a written determination (subject to the Disputes Clause) as to whether or not the component is an exclusion.  The contractors delivery obligation for the component(s) identified shall resume upon receipt of the Contracting Officers determination.
  
The COC is to be attached to the original invoice when submitted to the payment office.  Failure to do so will result in either nonpayment or a delay in payment.  

THE COAST GUARD RESERVES THE RIGHT TO PERFORM A SITE SURVEY OF THE CONTRACTORS AND SUB-CONTRACTORS CAPABILITIES.
The following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and Homeland Security Acquisition Regulations (HSAR), Provisions and Clauses apply:  

52.212-1   Instructions to Offerors  Commercial Items (Nov 2007)
 
52.212-2   Evaluation  Commercial Items (Jan 1999)

The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Award will be made utilizing the following factors, in descending order of importance.  The Coast Guard intends to award one contract to the Contractor whose quote is identified as offering the best value solution.
The Coast Guard may determine the best value which merits a higher price based on technical superiority.  The Coast Guard, using sound business judgment, will base the selection decision on an integrated assessment of the proposals relative capability as measured against the below evaluation factors:

	           Factor 1  Technical/Management Approach
                       Factor 2 -  Performance Plan 
                       Factor 3  Past Performance
                       Factor 4  Cost/Price

Factors 1, 2, and 3 are equal and each is significantly more important than Factor 4.     While the Cost/Price is an important part of the integrated selection decision, the non-Cost/Price factors are significantly more important than the Cost/Price factor.  Cost/Price will become increasingly important as proposal evaluation ratings for technical and performance factors approach equal.

    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

1.1	Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14 Notice for Filing Agency Protests          
                                                                               
NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

A: None for the time requirement, but we may perform some testing on powered equipement 16) Q:  Is there chilled water available for a water cooled condenser, or is AIR cooled preferred.

Further, the sole awardee and only the sole awardee shall submit its invoice to the government and receive payment from the government.<BR><BR>The Contractor and its employees shall exercise the utmost discretion in regard to all matters relating to their duties and functions. They shall not communicate to any person any information known to them by reason of their performance of services under this contract which has not been made public, except in the necessary performance of their duties or upon written authorization of the Contracting Officer.  All documents and records (including photographs) generated during the performance of work under this contract shall be for the sole use and become the exclusive property of the U.S Government. Furthermore, no article, book, pamphlet, email, recording, broadcast, speech television appearance, film or photograph concerning any aspect of work performed under this contract shall be published or disseminated through any media without the prior written authorization of the Contracting Officer. These obligations do no cease upon the expiration or termination of this contract.  The Contractor shall include the substance of this provision in all contracts of employment and in all subcontracts hereunder.<BR><BR>As the Contracts Officer Representative (COR) for the Oracle/PeopleSoft software products used in the Department of States Integrated Logistics Management System (ILMS), I recommend the use of other than full and open competition for the purpose of purchasing software support for its continued maintenance. The Department owns perpetual software licenses for the products -- however software support is a separate expense and represents an ongoing annual expenditure. The action to be approved is the order for Peoplesoft software support obtained through the Federal Supply Schedule contract with the most qualified provider. PeopleSoft products are the basis for much of ILMS. The PeopleSoft products currently used by ILMS include: PeopleSoft Inventory, PO, CRM Support server license, Object Studio, Balanced Scorecard, Enterprise Warehouse, Supply Chain Management, Activity Based Management, GL, and AM modules A full description of the software support services required for this purchase can be found on the GSA Federal Supply Schedule for the selected provider. The authority for sole source orders under GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts is Section 201 of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 U.S.C. 501). Due to the proprietary nature of the PeopleSoft software, the required software support is available only from a firm that is certified to resell Peoplesoft software support. This software support is crucial for continued utilization of the software in ILMS.<BR><BR>ILMS is the State Department's comprehensive supply chain management system. ILMS has been developed over a five-year period at a cost of over $70,000,000. ILMS is composed of an assortment of customized off-the-shelf software products as well as certain purpose-built software modules that have been linked and integrated with one another, and with the State Department's Financial Management System. In the course of design and development of ILMS for the State Department, the systems integrator selected and incorporated into ILMS the products and support services provided by PeopleSoft USA, Inc. ILMS will not function without these components. Although it would theoretically be possible to purchase and customize software that could replace the PeopleSoft software currently used by ILMS, integrate the new software with the rest of the ILMS software modules, and retrain the existing user base -- such an effort would be time consuming, prohibitively costly and would not shield the Department from an identical need for ongoing expenditures for maintenance and support. Moreover, a decision not to proceed to procure support from would have a significant adverse impact, placing at risk the majority of the software that makes up ILMS. Upon review of possible sources, a vendor will be chosen for software support for Oracle/PeopleSoft legacy software products. Since the services for the same software support were obtained last year, the universe of vendors has remained the same. These support services are necessary to maintain the existing production version of ILMS. The need to have PeopleSoft's technical support for the PeopleSoft software cannot be restated in a way that would permit the use of other commercial or non-developmental items. In the course of the development of ILMS, the Government made a serious effort to assure that Accenture, as the prime contractor, obtained as much competition as possible in subcontracting components of the task -- such as the software licenses and support contracts that it executed. To date, no sources have written to express an interest in this acquisition. When the Government assumes responsibility from a contractor for software licenses and support requirements that are integral to much larger IT systems, it is effectively precluded from competing the periodic renewal of such licenses and support agreements -- particularly if the systems involved have been customized and involve numerous proprietary components. The best alternative available to the government is to negotiate and contract for long-term license and support agreements at the offset.<BR><BR>

<DESC>CLOSING DATE OF THIS SOLICITATION IS HEREBY EXTENDED TO APRIL 21, 2008 AT 2 P.M.

Question 5)  You have mentioned the requirement for the unit to be capable of doing static surveys using GPS & GLONASS L1/L2.  Is the receiver also going to be used for Real Time Kinematic (RTK) survey work?  If it is to be used for RTK, there will be other issues to discuss as well, such as what radio system does it need to be compatible with (UHF or Spread Spectrum)? 

Answer:  No, the primary use for these instruments will be static survey.

Question 6)  Item 9 of the original solicitation indicates that it must have the "Ability to operate (start and stop recording) without separate datalogger."  This implies that you will be using it for static post-processed survey work.  If so, you have not indicated how much internal memory for data recording you require.  The Maxtors could contain anywhere from 0 Mb to 96 Mb.  The most common amount was usually 4, 8, or 16 Mb.    How much internal data recording memory do you require?

Answer:  We will require enough memory on one of the units to log 14 days of continuous 1 Hz data, because it may be used as an unattended base station. The other unit can have less, but at least 128 MB. 

Question 7)  You have not asked for training.  Do you require training for operation?

Answer:  Yes, depending on the complexity of the equipment, we would ask for 1/2 to 1 day of training.

Question 8)  The internal batteries for the Maxtor would generally last for 12+ hours.  Do you require internal batteries which last this long?

Answer:  This is fine for the internal battery, but we would need to be able to run one of the units off of a 12V car battery or AC power. 

Additional specifications:

1. One of the units needs enough internal memory to store 14 days of continuous 1 Hz data.  
2. We would need to be able to run one of the units off of a 12V car battery or AC power.

Invoicing Instructions - Mandatory:  

In accordance with DFARS clause 252.232-7003, invoices under this contract/order are to be submitted electronically.  This office, and the Department of Defense, have determined that Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) at https://wawf.eb.mil is the preferred electronic method to be used.  However, if your available computer hardware or computer configuration is incompatible with WAWF, the Web Invoicing System (WinS) at https://ecweb.dfas.mil may be used or any other mutually agreed to electronic method may be used in accordance with paragraph (c) of the clause.

Vendors must register in the WAWF system at https://wawf.eb.mil.  If you have questions during the registration process, you can call the WAWF help desk at (866) 618-5988.

The WAWF system provides for submission of invoices in several different forms.  It is recommended that an Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo) be used when the contract/order is for supplies and an Invoice as 2-in-1 (Services Only) be used when the contract/order is for services.   Using these types of WAWF documents automatically generates an e-mail notification to the receiver that their acceptance is required for the document to be processed for payment.    

Due to the fact that our office processes contracts/orders for various receivers from other agencies, we cannot at this time guarantee that the Deliver To code in block 15 of the Standard Form 1449 is registered and active in WAWF.  If the code is not active in the WAWF system, you will be unable to use either the Invoice and Receiving Report (Combo) or the Invoice as 2-in-1 (Services Only) option in WAWF.  In this case, you will need to enter your invoice using the Invoice option.  This will generate a stand-alone invoice not associated with a receiving report.  The receiving office will then be required to separately submit their receiving report to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service for processing.

Use of the WAWF electronic invoicing system can decrease the time required to process an invoice.  It also allows for tracking invoices and acceptance on-line without further correspondence.

<DESC>This is Amendment 0001 to Request for Information (RFI) Number 1406-04-08-RI-54519, published on April 4, 2008, under the FedBizOpps Service Category R notice, entitled "State-Based Training and Technical Assistance Services to Head Start and Early Head Start Grantees."  The purpose of this Amendment is to reemphasize that this RFI is a request for public comment.
Notwithstanding any contrary impression that may have been created by an email that you may have received on April 8, 2008, by which a government office, DHHS/ACF/OHS, forwarded certain third-party information, the Government has not yet determined an acquisition strategy for this requirement.  Nor has the Government determined or endorsed any particular method or approach for fulfilling the requirements mandated for the State-Based Training and Technical Assistance Services Offices under the "Improving Head Start for School Readiness Act of 2007."  We cannot emphasize strongly enough that we are eager for the public to share its knowledge when addressing the eleven items listed in the RFI and for your feedback on the Statement of Objectives to assist the Government with this acquisition.
We hope and expect that this process will result in numerous and unique proposed solutions in response to the Request for Proposal.  Please note that there is no incumbent for this requirement, nor, as noted above, does the Government have any favored approach.  Establishment of State-Based Training and Technical Assistance Services Offices is an entirely new requirement under the "Improving the Head Start for School Readiness Act of 2007."
The RFI with the Statement of Objectives can be found at the Acquisition Services Directorate website at: http://www.aqd.nbc.gov/solic/solicitations.asp.  We look forward to receiving your responses.  Please respond by April 18, 2008, as instructed in the RFI.  All responses will be considered by the Government, and we greatly appreciate your time and effort in preparing a response.
