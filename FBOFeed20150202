<DESC>The purpose of this Market Survey is to determine whether or not adequate competition exists and to determine the feasibility for small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses (SEDB) that are certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for the acquisition of 68 new spectrum analyzers to replace existing spectrum analyzers which are obsolete, have reached their end of life, and require replacement. The legacy spectrum analyzers were made by Tektronix. 

The spectrum analyzer is considered critical equipment required to provide spectral data and pulse width of the transmitted RF pulse. Pulse width measurements are made once every hour on the online channel. If the pulse width deviates from an acceptable tolerance an alarm is triggered. The alarm indicates that there is an impact on the ASR-9s ability to detect aircraft or has fallen out of FCC compliance causing interference with other radars.

Please see attachments for submittal requirements.

<p>Title: NEMSIS Technical Assistance Center</p>
<p>Response Date: February 17, 2015</p>
<p>Point of Contract: Vincent C. Lynch, Contracting Officer, (202) 366-9568.</p>
<p>Solicitation Number: DTNH2215RQ-00186</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Description: <br /></strong><br />The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) intends to negotiate with the University of Utah, School of Medicine, for the continuation of essential services to provide technical assistance to State EMS Offices, local EMS agencies, and EMS software developers as they convert or crosswalk to the NEMSIS standard, including version updates, maintaining the secure infrastructure to collect and manage data submitted by the States and Territories, maintaining and enhancing the NEMSIS national reporting system, and successfully coordinating the NEMSIS dataset with the Health Level 7 (HL7) Standard Development Organization and ANSI to assure interoperability with other health data systems</p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">Because there can be no interruption of NEMSIS service to the nation's EMS providers, it is also the purpose of this contract to maintain the existing TAC services while the transition strategy is being developed and implemented. This contract will continue implementation of the National EMS Information System (NEMSIS) and the National EMS Database and harmonize NEMSIS Version 3 with the electronic health record initiative and with regional and state level Health Information Exchange.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Background:</strong></p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">The <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Emergency Medical Services Agenda for the Future </em>(NHTSA, 1996) articulated the critical need for EMS data.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In October 2001, the General Accounting Office published a Report entitled: "Emergency Medical Services - Reported Needs are Wide-ranging, With Growing Focus on Lack of Data (GAO-02-28).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This report spoke to the need for consistent information for: (1) improving EMS performance at the local level, (2) setting and monitoring national level policy, and (3) improving researcher's ability to assess EMS outcomes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-layout-grid-align: auto"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">NHTSA, in cooperation with the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), funded a Cooperative Agreement with the National Association of State EMS Directors (NASEMSD) to develop and recommend alternatives for implementation of a National EMS Information System (NEMSIS) (FY01-04).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This effort resulted in finalization of a Version 2 NHTSA Uniform Prehospital Dataset, a comprehensive Data Dictionary, and a physical database schema mapped to the NEMSIS dataset, with XML linkage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This was an important first step in standardizing EMS patient care documentation nationwide.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan; mso-layout-grid-align: auto">&nbsp;</p>
<p>In FY05, in order to begin implementation of NEMSIS across the country, NHTSA first funded the NEMSIS Technical Assistance, through a Cooperative Agreement with the University of Utah, School of Medicine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A second 5 year Cooperative Agreement was awarded in FY10, and extends through September, 2015.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Purpose:</strong></p>
<p>The purpose is to develop and implement, over a two-year period, a strategy for transitioning some components of National EMS Information System and of the Technical Assistance Center to NHTSA. Determining the precise mix of elements that may be managed directly by NHTSA and which will be managed by the contractor, with NHTSA oversight, is complicated and will be determined through interactions among the TAC and NHTSA (including Chief Counsel, OCIO, NCSA and others).</p>

<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p>
<p>The incumbent contracts listed above are for the International Sites of the Recipient Epidemiology and Donor Evaluation Study III (REDS-III) program. The objective of REDS-III is to assure safe and effective blood banking and transfusion medicine practices through a comprehensive, multi-targeted strategy involving basic, translational, and clinical research to improve the benefits of transfusion while reducing its risks. Improving blood component safety and availability in the U.S. and internationally through the conduct of epidemiologic, survey, and laboratory studies is the cornerstone of the REDS program. Transfusion therapy is the most commonly employed, and, arguably, one of the least understood medical procedures in the U.S., affecting about five million recipients annually. This research program is not only critical to public health in the U.S., but also to countries struggling with the HIV epidemic where blood safety and availability are major concerns. The REDS-III program is comprised of one Central Laboratory, one Data Coordinating Center, four Domestic Hubs, and three International collaborative sites in Brazil, China, and South Africa.</p>
<p>REDS-III contractors are currently completing Phase 2 of the contract, conducting several study protocols and compiling donor, recipient, and linked databases, and performing laboratory testing. The NHLBI anticipates that the three International collaborative sites in Brazil, China, and South Africa will be needed until March 14, 2020 to complete the development, review and approval of analyses, presentations and publications based on the research conducted in Phase 2, as well as closure of databases.</p>
<p><strong>PURPOSE, CONTRACT STRUCTURE, AND PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</strong></p>
<p>The proposed action is a modification to each of three existing single award Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts, each with cost-reimbursement task orders. The contract modifications will increase the maximum ordering value of the IDIQ contracts. These modifications will not obligate any funds; funds are obligated under task orders that are issued against the base IDIQ contract. Additionally, the modifications will extend the period of performance of each contract by two years, through March 14, 2020.</p>

<p>This acquisition is conducted under the procedures as prescribed in FAR subpart 15-Contracting by Negotiation at an amount exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold ($150,000).</p>
<p><strong>STATUTORY AUTHORITY</strong></p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c) under provisions of the statutory authority of FAR Subpart 6.302-1 - Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1).</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p>
<p>The incumbent Contract No. HHSN268201100002I is for the Data Coordinating Center of the Recipient Epidemiology and Donor Evaluation Study III (REDS-III) program. The objective of REDS-III is to assure safe and effective blood banking and transfusion medicine practices through a comprehensive, multi-targeted strategy involving basic, translational, and clinical research to improve the benefits of transfusion while reducing its risks. Improving blood component safety and availability in the U.S. and internationally through the conduct of epidemiologic, survey, and laboratory studies is the cornerstone of the REDS program. Transfusion therapy is the most commonly employed, and, arguably, one of the least understood medical procedures in the U.S., affecting about five million recipients annually. This research program is not only critical to public health in the U.S., but also to countries struggling with the HIV epidemic where blood safety and availability are major concerns. The REDS-III program is comprised of one Central Laboratory, one Data Coordinating Center, four Domestic Hubs, and three International collaborative sites in Brazil, China, and South Africa.</p>
<p>REDS-III contractors are currently completing Phase 2 of the contract, conducting several study protocols and compiling donor, recipient, and linked databases, and performing laboratory testing. The NHLBI anticipates that the DCC will be needed until March 14, 2020 to complete the development, review and approval of analyses, presentations and publications based on the research conducted in Phase 2, as well as closure of databases.</p>
<p><strong>PURPOSE, CONTRACT STRUCTURE, AND PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</strong></p>

<a href="mailto:matthew.p.hancsarik@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Sacramento</a>
<DESC>This acquisition will be a Small Business Set Aside (100%) Request for Proposal (RFP). <br>  <br> In accordance with DFAR 236.204, the estimated cost range is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000. <br>  <br> This Procurement will be conducted under FSC Code: Z2PC, NAICS Code: 237990. The size standard for this NAICS code is $33,500,000. All questions should be directed to the Contract Specialist, Matthew Hancsarik, e-mail: matthew.p.hancsarikk@usace.army.mil or phone: (916) 293-4134.  Email will be the primary means of communication.   <br>  <br> Project Description: The primary objective of this project is to ensure the increment of the slope between about elevations 125 feet  and 160 feet  (NAVD 88) remains stable during future operations of the auxiliary spillway.  To achieve this, the lower bank slopes below about elevation 160 will be reinforced with 32' long, post tensioned, rock bolts based on U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Engineer Manual (EM) 1110-1-2907.  Bolts will generally be installed on a 20-foot by 20-foot diamond pattern; however, additional bolts may be installed at up to ten (10) locations at the direction of the Government.   <br>  <br> In addition to the installation of rock bolts as described above, it is anticipated that some dental concrete may be required to fill reentrant joint cavities to prevent the potential dislodging of several large rock blocks in the vicinity of Sta. 14+90.   <br>  <br> Site accessibility and the steep topography of the American River right bank site are a challenge to the planning, design and construction of the right bank stabilization effort.  The access ramp or temporary access route to the midslope work area will be steep with a grade as much as 30%.  Rock bolts will be installed on the lower vertical slopes and as such will require limited access drilling capability in order to install the bolts while suspended alongside the vertical slopes. <br>  <br> The RFP is anticipated to be posted on or about 17 February 2015. <br>  <br> The site visit/pre-proposal conference date, time and location will be identified in the solicitation. <br>  <br> OFFERORS ARE ADVISED THAT THIS PROJECT MAY BE DELAYED, CANCELLED OR REVISED AT ANY TIME DURING THE SOLICITATION, SELECTION, EVALUATION, NEGOTIATION AND/OR FINAL AWARD PROCESS. <br>  <br> Ordering Solicitation: Plans and specifications will NOT be provided in hard paper copy or CD format. The solicitation and all amendments for this acquisition will be posted on a secure Government website known as FedBizOpps (www.fbo.gov) once the RFP is issued. To register, click on the Register Now button in the Vendors Block and follow the instructions. For further information, please click on the FedBizOpps homepage link and the Vendor User Guide. <br>  <br> The only PLAN-HOLDER'S/BIDDER'S LIST now available is via FedBizOpps. When viewing the Synopsis/Pre-solicitation Notice, you will click on the 'ADD ME TO INTERESTED VENDORS' to enter your information. This function does not, however, allow you to identify yourself as a Prime or Sub. It is recommended that you identify your category in parentheses at either the beginning or end of your company name. For example: XYZ Construction (Prime/Sub).  IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CONTRACTOR TO CHECK FEDBIZOPPS FREQUENTLY FOR ANY AMENDMENTS OR CHANGES TO THE SOLICITATION. <br>

The notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.</p>
<p>The information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method and to determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government's requirement.</p>
<p>ALL organizations with the capability and availability to perform the requirement under the applicable NAICS code are invited to submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>NORTH AMERICAN CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE<br />The NAICS code applicable to this requirement is 541990, All Other Professional, Scientific and Technical Services, with size standard $15 million.</p>
<p>Background<br />The National Institute on Aging (NIA), one of the 27 Institutes and Centers of NIH, leads a broad scientific effort to understand the nature of aging and to extend the healthy, active years of life. The Intramural Research Program (IRP) of the National Institute on Aging (NIA) provides a stimulating setting for a comprehensive effort to understand aging through multidisciplinary investigator initiated research, in this regard.</p>
<p>One of the IRP's program activities includes the Neurocognitive Aging Section (NAS). Age-related deficits in cognitive function compromise the quality of life and are among the most troubling consequences of growing older. A major line of research in the NAS is aimed at establishing a nonhuman primate model for defining the basis of normal cognitive aging, and for developing effective interventions. Early studies succeeded in revealing the basic neuropsychological profile of aging, and we have now turned attention to the specific nature of decline, with the aim of defining the effects of aging on the component processes of declarative/episodic memory. Young and aged monkeys are tested across a battery of novel assessments that manipulate demands on key operating characteristics of memory: 1) the contributions of recollection and familiarity to visual recognition, 2) memory for spatial and non-spatial context, 3) the temporal structure of experience, and 4) the relational organization of memory. An important goal of these studies is to develop a detailed and sensitive framework for testing the working hypothesis that age-related decline results from large-scale restructuring of the neural networks that support normal memory.<br /> <br />Purpose and Objectives<br />This Sources Sought notice seeks to determine eligible sources with the capability to provide the services described in this notice. The purpose of this potential requirement is to test in a nonhuman primate model whether pharmacological intervention aimed at reducing excessive neuronal activity, alone or in combination with an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor approved for use in the symptomatic treatment of AD, reverses cognitive impairment in older monkeys with memory deficits. The contractor should be able to provide all necessary young and aged monkeys, or be able to provide animal support to existing young and aged monkeys, behavioral testing equipment, and personnel.</p>
<p>The anticipated requirement is a continuation of work performed under the existing research project entitled "Testing Pharmacological Intervention on Rhesus Monkeys for the National Institute on Aging (NIA)." This project has provided a resource of animals and cognitive data for potential parallel studies conducted by the Government dealing with the same subjects, and uses MRI to examine associated brain effects of the pharmacological treatment. An additional phase of research development is needed and is anticipated as described herein.</p>
<p>Specifically, the contractor will be expected to conduct the work utilizing an established colony of 12 rhesus  macaques spanning a range of ages from young adults to aged subjects, 12 to over 21 years of age. All animals have previously received extensive background training on two computer automated tests of memory and executive function, i.e., a delayed matching to sample recognition memory task (DMTS), and a self-ordered spatial span (SOSS) test. These procedures measure cognitive capacities that are known to be both vulnerable to aging, and sensitive to a variety of pharmacological treatments. Requirements to implemenet include:</p>
<p>Test the effects of systemic levetiracetam administration, alone or in combination with systemic donepezil treatment, on DMTS and SOSS performance in 12 young and aged rhesus monkeys (12 to 21 +years of age). Each subject will be tested under all control and experimental conditions; Compile behavioral results according to standard performance measures (e.g., trials/errors to criterion, mean percent correct under each cognitive demand) in digital format, and provide routine statistical analysis of results. Analyses will examine drug effects of task performance as a function of age; Make experimental subjects available at request of the government for in vivo brain imaging by MRI. Aside from coordinating animal availability, these activities, including any transportation, maintenance and imaging will be carried out at no cost to the contractor. Scheduling will be arranged in consultation with the Contractor so as to avoid disruption to ongoing behavioral testing.</p>
<p>The place of performance for this potential requirement includes Contractor facilities as well as periodic onsite visits possible to Government facilities located at the NIA unit on the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Campus in Baltimore, MD. The period of performance is anticipated for six (6) months to become effective on or around April 1, 2015.<br /> <br />Capability statements sought<br />Interested parties are expected to review this notice to familiarize itself with the requirements of this project. Failure to do so will be at your firm's own risk.</p>
<p>Respondents must provide, as part of their responses, clear and convincing documentation of their capability of providing the services specified in this notice. Respondents must provide a general overview of the respondents' opinions about the difficulty and /or feasibility of the potential requirement, and any information regarding innovative ideas or concepts.</p>
<p>The Respondent must also provide information in sufficient details of the respondents' (a) staff expertise, including their availability, experience, and formal and other training; (b) current in-house capability and capacity to perform the work; (c) prior completed projects of similar nature; (d) corporate experience and management capability; and (e) examples of prior completed Government contracts, references, and other related information.</p>
<p>The respondent must also provide their DUNS number, organization name, address, point of contact, and size and type of business (e.g., 8(a), HubZone, etc.) pursuant to the applicable NAICS code and any other information that may be helpful in developing or finalizing the acquisition requirements.</p>
<p>All responses to this sources sought notice must reference solicitation number HHS-NIH-NIDA-SSSA-SS-2015-111 and be submitted electronically (via email) to Hunter Tjugum, Contract Specialist at hunter.tjugum@nih.gov on or before the closing date specified in this announcement.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION
<p>This is a Request for Information (RFI). This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this RFI is to obtain knowledge and information for project planning purposes. The government will not award a contract on the basis of this notice, or otherwise pay for information solicited by it. Proprietary information should be clearly marked. The requested information is for planning and market research purposes only and will not be publicly released.</p>
<p>PILL IMAGE RECOGNITION - REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)</p>
<p>Unidentified and misidentified prescription pills present challenges for patients and professionals. Unidentified pills can be found by family members, health professionals, educators, and law enforcement. The nine out of 10 U.S. citizens over age 65 who take more than one prescription pill can be prone to misidentifying those pills. Taking such pills can result in adverse drug events that affect health or cause death.</p>
<p>To reduce such errors, any person should easily be able to be confirm that a prescription pill or a refill is correct. For example, a person should be able to easily verify - or not - that a refill that has a different color, shape, or size is just a different generic version of the same medication he or she was already taking.</p>
<p>To help address these problems, the National Library of Medicine (NLM) Computational Photography Project for Pill Identification (C3PI) is developing infrastructure and tools for identifying prescription pills. The infrastructure includes NLM's RxIMAGE database of freely available, high quality prescription pill images and associated pill data. One tool is the freely accessible RxIMAGE API (Application Programming Interface) for text-based search and retrieval of images and data from the RxIMAGE database.</p>
<p>NLM now seeks to expand the toolset to include smart phone apps to visually search for and retrieve pill images and data. A person will photograph an unknown prescription pill, possibly under poor lighting conditions, from an angle, or at low resolution. The app will return one or more RxIMAGE images and data that are most likely to match the photographed pill.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>See Attached RFI for Images.<br /><br /><br />(a) User takes photo of front of unknown prescription pill<br />(b) Smart phone app returns one or more possible matches - in this case the images of the fronts and backs of four pills</p>
<p>This Request For Information (RFI) is a pilot for a forthcoming Pill Image Recognition Challenge for visually identifying pills. The Challenge has as its main objective the development and discovery of high-quality software that matches images of unknown prescription pills to images in the RxIMAGE database. The pilot will help ensure that the Challenge is successful.</p>
<p>This RFI is extended to private industry, academia, national laboratories, and government agencies. Respondents to the RFI are asked to submit executable software that matches consumer images - photos of pills taken by cell phone digital cameras - with reference images obtained from images in the RxIMAGE database. It is anticipated that respondents will include professionals and students, individually or in teams, in computer vision and computer graphics working on content-based image retrieval. Respondents to this RFI may also participate in the Challenge.</p>
<p>The RFI and the Challenge are part of NLM's efforts to make prescription pill matching software freely accessible to health care providers and the general public. Potential public safety benefits include the reduction of medication errors and improvements in poison control and in emergency response.</p>
<p>NLM seeks to better understand incidents involving unidentified or misidentified pills and their impact. Health professionals, educators, law enforcement, private citizens, other affected parties, and RFI respondents are invited to send descriptions of their professional or personal experiences, or links to specifically relevant media coverage, to PIR@nlm.nih.gov.</p>
<p>THE RxIMAGE DATABASE</p>
<p>The RxIMAGE database underlies this RFI and, later, the Challenge and potentially any future pill image recognition apps. This database contains freely available, high quality images and associated data for prescription pills marketed in the United States. It is a growing database that now has images of more than 3,000 pills. Examples of pills are capsules and tablets intended for oral use.</p>
<p>Photos of pills for the RxIMAGE database were taken under laboratory lighting conditions, from a camera directly above the front and the back faces of the pill, and at high resolution. The JPEG images in this database were captured using specialized digital macro-photography techniques. Image files in the RxIMAGE database contain NLM watermarks.</p>
<p>The data associated with each pill image include appearance (color, shape, size, text on the pill, etc.), identifiers such as its National Drug Code (NDC), and ingredients.</p>
<p>THE RFI's REFERENCE IMAGES</p>
<p>The RFI's reference images consist of 1,000 JPEG images taken from the RxIMAGE database. While an image in the RxIMAGE database shows both the front and the back of a pill, a reference image is of either the front or the back.</p>
<p>THE RFI's CONSUMER IMAGES</p>
<p>The RFI's consumer images consist of 3,000 JPEG images of the same pills that were photographed to create the RFI reference images. However, they were taken with a variety of digital cameras, under various lighting conditions, and at camera angles not necessarily perpendicular to the faces of the pills. They are like photos of unknown prescription pills that the general public might take.</p>
<p>Each RFI consumer image matches one RFI reference image. Conversely, each RFI reference image matches at least two RFI consumer images, taken under different conditions.</p>
<p>SOFTWARE TO BE DEVELOPED FOR THIS RFI</p>
<p>RFI respondents are asked to develop algorithms and software for matching images of consumer pills to reference images - and to submit their executable software as described below. The software does not need to identify pills by name. The software can use any programming language(s).</p>
<p>The software should be a batch-mode program or a script whose input consists of a set of unknown images and a set of reference images. The output should be a comma-separated-value similarity matrix S in which the term s(i,j) is a number in the unit interval [0,1] that indicates how well the i-th unknown image matches the j-th reference image. A larger value should indicate a better match.</p>
<p>Respondents can use the RxIMAGE database and the RFI reference and consumer images in developing their algorithms and software and in testing how well their software works. They can also supplement the consumer images.</p>
<p>Technical details about the reference and consumer images to be made available to respondents, instructions about the software and output that respondents are asked to submit, and the address for submitting a USB drive containing this software are at PIR.nlm.nih.gov.</p>
<p>HOW NLM WILL USE THE RFI SUBMISSIONS</p>
<p>NLM will use these submissions to test, evaluate, and as needed refine the components of the forthcoming Challenge: instructions, hardware and software systems, and metrics for use in selecting the winner. RFI submissions will thereby help ensure that the Challenge instructions are accurate and clear, that the Challenge judging will be impartial, and that Challenge responses will include high quality software. The software and output submitted in response to this RFI will not themselves be judged.</p>
<p>The metrics used to judge the Challenge will give high marks to software that correctly matches the most pills. One metric may be the number of images that the similarity matrix says are most similar to their reference images. The metrics may also address what might be called false positives (the similarity is highest but not to the correct reference image) and false negatives (the similarity to the correct reference image is low), the need to consider images of both the front and the back of a pill, color similarity, an unknown image that is about equally similar to multiple reference images, the value of selecting several candidate matches, and speed.</p>
<p>NLM will post information about the responses to this RFI at PIR.nlm.nih.gov. This information may include summary statistics and a discussion of the responses.</p>
<p>DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THIS RFI AND THE CHALLENGE</p>
<p>The Challenge will have its own reference images and its own consumer images. To compete in the Challenge, a person or team must submit a USB drive that contains the algorithm in pseudo-code, the open source human- and machine-readable software that implements the algorithm, the executable code, and the similarity matrix.</p>
<p>Persons and organizations that do not include algorithms and/or open-source code are nonetheless encouraged to participate in the Challenge, but are not eligible to win the Challenge prize. U.S. Government agencies and employees must follow their agency guidelines on Challenge participation.</p>
<p>NLM plans to use the RFI and the Challenge submissions in developing, independently or possibly with others, freely accessible pill image recognition software and tools, such as apps.</p>
<p>RFI SCHEDULE</p>

<DESC>The Western Regional Contracting Office (WRCO) is conducting a Sources Sought for Market Research purposes only.  There is no solicitation available at this time.  Requests for solicitation will receive no response.

The DRAFT PWS is attached for informational purposes only.  NOTE:  Potential sources shall be within 60 miles driving distance from MAMC to ensure emergency testing is rapid in order to ensure timely testing as required by the DRAFT PWS. <br> WRCO anticipates a Firm Fixed Price contract will be awarded.  WRCO anticipates a 6-month base Period of Performance (POP) 1 April 2015 - 30 September 2015 with two 1-year option periods, ending 30 September 2017, if exercised. <br> Information is being collected from all potential sources at this time.

Firms responding to this announcement should indicate whether they are a large business, small business, small disadvantaged business (SDB), woman-owned small business (WOSB), 8(a)-certified business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB), veteran-owned small business (VOSB), or Historically Underutilized Business small business (HUBZone).  The National American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this action is 621511, Medical Laboratories.  All prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database to be awarded a DoD contract.  WRCO has not yet determined the acquisition strategy for this requirement, including whether a set-aside strategy is applicable.  Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that small business prime contractors must perform over 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14. <br> All interested parties shall submit a capabilities package.  The capabilities package should be BRIEF and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements.  Recent, relevant experience in all areas should be provided, including whether this experience was as a prime or subprime contractor, whether it was in support of a Government or commercial contract, and what the scope of the experience was.  Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided.  Interested contractors will clearly explain how they intend to meet the stated requirements.  Your statement of capabilities should include the following: Company Name; Address; Point of Contact; Telephone number; E-Mail Address; CAGE Code; Web Page URL; and Small business size certification, if applicable.  Please submit one (1) electronic copy of your response to thomas.a.lamb.civ@mail.mil.  Statements should be submitted no later than Tuesday, 10 February 2015 at 12:00 (Noon) PM Pacific.  The Government will not answer any questions. <br> The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this synopsis nor will it reimburse the contractor for any costs associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice.  This synopsis does not constitute a Request for Quotation (RFQ), Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor does this issuance restrict the Government's acquisition approach.  The Government reserves the right to reject in whole or part any industry input as a result of this announcement.  The Government recognizes that proprietary data may be a part of this effort.  If so, clearly mark such restricted or proprietary data and present it as an addendum to the non-restricted/non-proprietary information. <br>

<p>Nathan.D.Johnson@aphis.usda.gov</p>
<p>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION<br />(SOLE OR SINGLE SOURCE)</p>
<p>1. IDENTIFICATION OF THE AGENCY AND THE CONTRACTING <br />ACTIVITY:</p>
<p>Requesting Agency:<br />USDA APHIS VS, SPRS<br />Aquaculture, Swine and Avian Health Center (Swine)<br />4700 River Road - Unit 43<br />Riverdale, MD 20737</p>
<p>Contracting Activity:<br />USDA, APHIS, MRPBS, ASD<br />Minneapolis Procurement Branch<br />Butler Square, Fifth Floor<br />100 North 6th Street<br />Minneapolis, MN 55403</p>
<p>2. NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING <br />APPROVED:</p>
<p>The APHIS, Veterinary Services (VS), Influenza A in Swine Surveillance Program, managed by VS Swine Health Center Staff request a noncompetitive acquisition of an external technical epidemiologic review of the surveillance program to support surveillance refinement due to decreases in funding in FY 2017.</p>
<p>3. A DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES, EQUIPMENT, OR SERVICES <br />REQUIRED TO MEET AGENCY NEEDS (INCLUDING THE ESTIMATED <br />VALUE OF THE ACQUISITION INCLUSIVE OF OPTIONS):</p>
<p>The requested service is an unbiased scientific review of the USDA's Influenza A virus in Swine (IAV-S) surveillance program by Dr. Ian Gardner, a well-established, published, and internationally recognized epidemiologist. Dr. Gardner has knowledge and experience in swine medicine and specifically has experience with influenza in swine. Dr. Gardner does not have ties to the IAV-S surveillance program and is not affiliated with an institution with ties to the program.</p>
<p>This review is being requested due to a change in funding sources for this program. The program has previously been funded through non- year monies provided by Health and Human Services. These monies will be depleted in FY 2016. APHIS intends to continue some level of swine influenza surveillance beyond FY2016, but the program will be absorbed into a comprehensive surveillance program for swine with a reduced budget. This review will assist in refining the surveillance program in order to maximize program effectiveness with this funding change.</p>
<p>The review will span Fiscal year 2009-2014 and focus on the epidemiologic aspects of the program including surveillance goals and objectives, overall strategy, structure and content, including but not limited to targeted populations, sample selection and submission, sampling efficiency, laboratory testing processes (overall surveillance design), collaborative work with the Agriculture Research Services, reporting processes, inference of results, surveillance sensitivity , and gaps in the system. Recommendations for process improvement and system efficiencies are also requested. The review will not focus on the appropriateness of program objectives, stakeholder satisfaction, or the cost-benefit of the system as these aspects will be evaluated through a parallel internal APHIS review.</p>
<p>This is the first time this program review has been requested. Future similar reviews may be requested but are not planned at this time. This assessment should be fully completed within one year of award so that results can be evaluated and adjustments in the IAV-S surveillance program can be discussed with stakeholders and implemented by or before the beginning of FY 2017.</p>
<p>The cost of this service is not to exceed $50,000.</p>
<p>4. IDENTIFICATION OF THE STATUATORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING <br />NONCOMPETITIVE ACQUISITIONS:</p>
<p>FAR 6.302-1</p>
<p>5. A DEMONSTRATION THAT THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE <br />QUALIFICATIONS OR THE NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES <br />USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED:</p>
<p>Dr. Ian A Gardner possesses all of the unique qualifications required to perform this scientific program review. He is an internationally recognized epidemiologist whose work is well respected by USDA APHIS, academics, and the Swine community.</p>
<p>Dr. Gardner holds a PhD and master's degree in preventive veterinary medicine from the Davis School of Veterinary Medicine at the University of California. He holds a bachelor's degree in veterinary science from the University of Sydney, and worked in his native Australia as a veterinary officer specializing in pig and poultry diseases. He has experience in working with influenza in both swine and poultry, and has worked in influenza eradication programs in swine and poultry both in the United States and abroad.</p>
<p>Dr. Gardner has served in leadership roles in various professional organizations, including the Association of Veterinary Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, and the Conference of Research Workers in Animal Disease. He is internationally recognized for developing methods to assess disease risk in terrestrial and aquatic food animals. These methods have been used in global veterinary and public health activities, and have influenced policies at the United States Department of Agriculture and the World Organization for Animal Health. Dr. Gardner has more than 200 peer&#8209;reviewed scientific publications in leading journals, such as Preventive Veterinary Medicine, American Veterinary Medical Association, and Veterinary Pathology.</p>
<p>Dr. Gardner does not have ties to the IAV-S surveillance program, and is not affiliated with an institution with ties to the program.</p>
<p><br />6. A DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE <br />SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS IS PRACTICABLE, INCLUDING WHETHER A NOTICE WAS, OR WILL BE, PUBLICIZED AS REQUIRED BY FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION (FAR) SUBPART 5.2, AND IF NOT, WHICH EXCEPTION UNDER FAR 5.202 APPLIES: <br /><br />Published on FBO.gov</p>
<p>7. A DETERMINATION BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER THAT THE <br />ANTICIPATED COST TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE FAIR AND <br />REASONABLE, AND THE BASIS FOR THAT DETERMINATION:</p>
<p>Per internal price estimates and analysis this price is fair and reasonable.</p>
<p><br />8. A DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED (FAR <br />PART 10) AND THE RESULTS, OR AN EXPLANATION OF THE REASON <br />MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT PERFORMED:</p>
<p>Based on routine interactions with the Swine Industry, consultation with USDA colleagues, and a consultation with the Chief Epidemiologist for Veterinary Services, no one else has the unique qualifications that Dr. Gardner possesses. All other known sources have strong ties to the USDA, academic institutions affiliated with the swine industry, the IAV-S surveillance program itself, or do not have the swine medicine expertise and experience of dealing with influenza in swine.</p>
<p>9. ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL <br />AND OPEN COMPETITION - FAR 6.303-2(a)(9):</p>
<p>The required unique qualifications are:<br />&bull; Be a well-established, published, and internationally recognized epidemiologist; <br />&bull; Have knowledge and experience in swine medicine;<br />&bull; Have knowledge and medical experience dealing with influenza in swine;<br />&bull; Have no ties to, or affiliation with an institution with ties to, the IAV-S surveillance program.<br />&bull; Be able to dedicate time to the review and provide a written report within FY 2015.</p>

<DESC><p>The General Services Administration (GSA), Federal Acquisition Service (FAS), Acquisition Operations Division (hereinafter referred to as "AOD") intends to award a bridge contract with a 6-month base period and one 3-month option period to Qwest, dba CenturyLink, Inc (hereinafter referred to as Qwest) to provide essential continuity of services during transition for Network Services Division's (NSD) Region 9 FAS telecommunications operations. This bridge contract is for Qwest's Arizona / Nevada (AZ / NV) Local Services Agreement (LSA) I contract and it will provide local telephone service in Arizona and Nevada.</p>
<p>Region 9 AOD is doing this contract action in order to allow for the continuation of transitioning services under the existing AZ / NV LSA to the AZ / NV LSA II contracts. The current Bridge which was established in order to transition Qwest's telephone inventory will expire on January 31, 2015. Of the 7,529 lines needed to be transitioned, 675 lines remain. This contract action will allow for NSD to complete their transition of the remaining&nbsp;4,101 lines. As Qwest's AZ / NV LSA I current Bridge contract expires on January 31, 2015, and there is no way to extend the contract, a second bridge contract is needed to provide continuity of service, at the negotiated rates established in the AZ/NV LSA I contract until all lines are fully transitioned to the AZ / NV LSA II contracts, which were awarded on September 30, 2013.</p>
<p>Approval is sought to award this bridge contract on a sole source basis because Qwest is the current service provider for these telephone services and in accordance with 41 U.S.C 253 (c) 1, no other services will satisfy the agency's requirements during the transition period at the negotiated rate. The transition process of this requirement is imperative to ensure that GSA's client agencies that use Qwest's&nbsp;4,101 telephone lines, do not lose the negotiated rates of service and incur additional costs with the expiration of the current contract, while GSA is in the process of moving these lines to the AZ / NV LSA II contract.</p>
<p>The period of performance for this proposed contract is a six month base period and one three month option period. Base period: February 1, 2015 - August 31, 2015. Option Period 1: September 1, 2015 - November 30, 2015. <br />The resultant contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-79 (effective December 26, 2014). This notice of intent to award a sole source bridge contract is not a request for competitive proposals. However, in accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(15)(ii), all responsible sources that feel they can meet the Government's requirements may submit a capability statement which shall be considered by the agency. Responses to this notice shall contain sufficient information to establish the interested parties' bona-fide capabilities for fulfilling the requirements within the statement of objectives (SOO), and include: the Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number (DUNS), and the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN). All offerors must have an active registration in the System for Award management (SAM) www.sam.gov. A determination by the Government not compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The information received will be retained as market research.</p>

<p>CDC42.0001 Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) Requirements:</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 42.15, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will review and evaluate contract performance. FAR 42.1502 and 42.1503 requires agencies to prepare evaluations of contractor performance and submit them to the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS). The CDC utilizes the Department of Defense (DOD) web-based Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) to prepare and report these contractor performance evaluations. All information contained in these assessments may be used by the Government, within the limitations of FAR 42.15, for future source selections in accordance with FAR 15.304 where past performance is an evaluation factor.</p>
<p>The CPARS system requires a contractor representative to be assigned so that the contractor has appropriate input into the performance evaluation process. The CPARS contractor representative will be given access to CPARS and will be given the opportunity to concur or not-concur with performance evaluations before the evaluations are complete. The CPARS contractor representative will also have the opportunity to add comments to performance evaluations.</p>
<p>The assessment is not subject to the Disputes clause of the contract, nor is it subject to appeal beyond the review and comment procedures described in the guides on the CPARS website. Refer to: www.cpars.gov for details and additional information related to CPARS, CPARS user access, how contract performance assessments are conducted, and how Contractors participate. Access and training for all persons responsible for the preparation and review of performance assessments is also available at the CPARS website.</p>
<p>The contractor must provide the CDC contracting office with the name, e-mail address, and phone number of their designated CPARS representative who will be responsible for logging into CPARS and reviewing and commenting on performance evaluations. The contractor must maintain a current representative to serve as the contractor representative in CPARS. It is the contractor's responsibility to notify the CDC contracting office, in writing (letter or email), when their CPARS representative information needs to be changed or updated. Failure to maintain current CPARS contractor representative information will result in the loss of an opportunity to review and comment on performance evaluations.</p>
<p>Provide the current CPARS representative information below.</p>

<p>(End of Provision)<br />E.2 Past Performance Evaluation</p>
<p>Past performance information will be evaluated in the following manner:</p>
<p>E.2.1 Each Offeror shall be evaluated on its past performance under current and prior contracts. By past performance, the Government means the Offeror's record of conforming to specifications and to standards of good workmanship; the Contractor's record of forecasting and controlling costs; the Offeror's adherence to contract schedules and terms, including the administrative aspects of performance; the Offeror's reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the Offeror's business like concern for the interest of the customer and the degree of quality of deliverables and performance.</p>
<p>E.2.2 Past performance will not be scored, but the Government's conclusions about overall quality of the Offeror's past performance will be highly influential in determining the relative merits of the Offeror's proposal and in selecting the Offeror whose proposal is considered the most advantageous/best value to the Government.</p>
<p>E.2.3 The Government will focus on information that demonstrates quality of performance for similar services relative to the size and complexity of the procurement under consideration.</p>
<p>E.2.4 The Government will evaluate the quality of the Offeror's past performance based on collaborated past performance evaluations included in the Offeror's proposal and/or other information obtained from references provided by the Offeror, as well as other relevant past performance information obtained from other sources known to the Government. The Government may or may not survey all contracts listed by the Offeror, and reserves the right to perform customer surveys only for those contracts deemed by the Government to be most relevant to this procurement. The information provided by the Offeror in accordance with provision "E.10 Submission of Past Performance Information" will be used by the Government to gather required past performance evaluations.</p>
<p>E.2.5 Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based on a consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances. It will not be based on absolute standards of acceptable performance.</p>
<p>E.2.6 The assessment of the Offeror's past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the Offeror and the other competitors. Thus, an Offeror with an exceptional record of relevant past performance may receive a more favorable evaluation than another whose record is acceptable and/or less relevant, even though both may have acceptable technical and business proposals.</p>
<p>E.2.7 An Offeror without a record of past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably.</p>
<p>E.2.8 Information provided by Offerors, as requested under Section L herein, relating to problems encountered on the identified contracts and the Offeror's corrective actions will be considered when unfavorable reports of past performance are received. If award will be made without conducting discussions, Offerors may be given the opportunity to clarify certain aspects of past performance information (e.g. relevance of an Offeror's past performance information and averse past performance which the Offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond). Communications may be held with Offerors to obtain additional information regarding adverse past performance when required for making a competitive range determination. If discussions are held, Offerors will be given an opportunity to address unfavorable reports of past performance. Recent contracts will be examined to ensure that corrective measures have been implemented.</p>
<p>E.2.9 Past performance will be evaluated for only those Offerors remaining in the competitive range after completion of the review of the business proposals and technical proposals.</p>
<p><br />E.2.10 Evaluation of past performance information will be reflected in terms of the following degrees of performance assessment:</p>
<p>E.2.10.1 Excellent: A significant majority of the sources of information are consistently firm in stating that the Offeror's performance was superior and that they would unhesitatingly do business with the Offeror again. Complaints are negligible or unfounded. The Offeror has no record of criminal conduct, civil fraud, or negligence, or the record is old and the Offeror has demonstrated by more recent performance that corrective action has made the likelihood of such conduct in the future highly improbably. No doubt exists that the Offeror will successfully perform the Government's requirements as stated in the RFP.</p>
<p>E.2.10.2 Good: Most sources of information state that the Offeror's performance was good, better than average, etc., and that they would willingly do business with the Offeror again. Complaints, though perhaps well-founded, are few and relatively minor. The Offeror has no record of criminal conduct, civil fraud, or negligence, or the record is old and the Offeror has demonstrated by more recent performance that corrective action has made the likelihood of such conduct in the future highly improbable. Little doubt exists that the Offeror will successfully perform the Government's requirements as stated in the RFP.</p>
<p>E.2.10.3 Neutral: Either no past performance history exists for the corporation, predecessor companies, key personnel, or major/critical subcontractors, or the Offeror's record of past performance was neither predominantly favorable nor unfavorable. In the latter case, sources of information are roughly divided over the quality of the Offeror's performance. While some state that they would do business with the Offeror again, others are doubtful or would not. Complaints are balanced by reports of good work. The Offeror has no record of criminal conduct, civil fraud, or negligence, or the record is old.</p>
<p>E.2.10.4 Marginal: Many sources of information made unfavorable reports about the Offeror's performance and either express serious doubts about doing business with the Offeror again or state that they would refuse to do so. However, there are some favorable reports, and some sources of information indicate that they would do business with the Offeror again. There are many significant, serious, and well-founded complaints, but there are some reports of very good performance. The Offeror may have been indicted, pled guilty, or may have been found guilty in matters of criminal conduct, but the issues are either unresolved, relatively minor, or do not reflect a company-wide or managerial pattern of wrongdoing. The Offeror may have lost civil suits for fraud or negligence, but there is no company-wide or managerial pattern of fraudulent, negligent, or criminal conduct. Some doubt exists that the Offeror will successfully perform the Government's requirements as stated in the RFP.</p>
<p>E.2.10.5 Poor: A significant majority of sources of information are consistently firm in stating that the Offeror's performance was entirely unsatisfactory and that they would not do business with the Offeror again under any circumstances. Customer complaints are substantial or numerous and are well founded. Or, although not debarred or suspended, the Offeror is under indictment or has been convicted of criminal conduct, or has been found civilly liable for fraud or negligence. The Offeror either has presented no persuasive evidence of having taken appropriate corrective action that will guard against such conduct in the foreseeable future, or it appears unlikely that the corrective action will be effective. Serious doubt exists that the Offeror will successfully perform the Government requirements as stated in the RFP.</p>
<p>(End of Provision)</p>
<p>E.3 Evaluation of Technical Proposal</p>
<p>E.3.1 The Government will perform a qualitative technical review of proposals. The technical evaluation will be performed in accordance with the following criteria:</p>
<p>Technical Evaluation:</p>
<p>The technical evaluation sub-factors and evaluation criteria are as follows:</p>
<p>Criteria <br />Product Specifications <br />Packaging Dimensions <br />Shelf Life<br /><br />Product Specifications: Contractors are to provide brand name or equal products. If the proposed item does not have the same NDC # as the one provided, the Contract must submit enough information to allow the Government to make a determination that the substituted item is of equal specifications and quality. Failure to do so will result in vendor being ineligible for award of those Lines/CLINS.<br />This criterion will be evaluated on a Pass/Fail basis. In order to be considered for award, the offeror must pass this criterion.</p>
<p>Packaging Dimensions: Contractors are to provide packaging in the exact dimensions listed in the attached Excel Spreadsheet titled "Attachment A - RFP 2015-N-16862". Each item must detail UoM and packaging dimensions. The contractor must submit enough information to in order to allow the Government to make a determination that the product proposed will fit in the defined specifcations. <br />This criterion will be evaluated on a Pass/Fail basis. In order to be considered for award, the offeror must pass this criterion.</p>
<p>Shelf Life Information: Contractors are to provide the requested shelf life information of the products they are proposing on. That information is to include at a minimum a shelf life description and the proposed shelf life. The contractor must submit enough information to in order to allow the Government to make a determination that the product proposed will meet the requirements identified in D.5.4.a. <br />This criterion will be evaluated on a Pass/Fail basis.</p>
<p>E.4.3 Relationship between Cost or Price and Technical Strength</p>
<p>Offerors are advised that in proposal evaluation, paramount consideration shall be given to cost rather than technical after consideration of the pass/fail factors. Furthermore, price will be evaluated on the basis of price reasonableness. The contract(s) shall be awarded to the vendor(s) whose proposal (technical and business) is determined to be the most advantageous and the best value to the Government, price and other factors (identified in section E.3.1) considered.</p>
<p>E.4 Evaluation of Business Proposal</p>
<p>E.4.1 The Government will evaluate the Offeror's proposed prices to include all lines to determine price reasonableness for proposed products.</p>
<p>E.4.2 The Contracting Officer shall assume, for the purpose of making multiple awards, that $1,000 would be the administrative cost to the Government for issuing and administrating each contract awarded under this solicitation. Individual awards shall be for the items or combination of items that result in the lowest aggregate cost to the Government, including the assumed administration costs.</p>
<p>E.4.3 A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the Offeror's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

(vi)   The following is a detailed description of the requirements for this solicitation: 






	
STATEMENT OF WORK

GENERAL INFORMATION

1.	Title of Project:  Hill-Rom Hospital Beds Preventive Maintenance and Repair

2.	Scope of Work:  The contractor shall provide all resources necessary to provide full preventive maintenance and repair on (17) Seventeen Total Care Hospital Beds model Total Care Basic, and (92) ninety two Hospital Beds model Versa Care.  These beds are at the Ralph H. Johnson Veterans Affairs Medical Center (109 Bee Street, Charleston, South Carolina).

3.	Background:  This equipment requires regular maintenance and is used daily in delivering safe 
patient care and maintenance has to be completed immediately.  Downtime might cause patient impact depending on the hospital census.  Moreover, due to unavailability of equipment services a need to rent will occur, which would be cost prohibitive. Also due to the proprietary nature of the equipment and software, only a certified Hill-Rom technician should perform the maintenance.
	
4.  Performance Period: Base Year plus 4-One Year Options 

        5.  Type of Contract: Firm-Fixed-Price

SCOPE: The Contractor shall be fully responsible and accountable for all listed equipment beginning on the date specified in the Notice to Proceed. These specifications are a statement of the minimum level services that are to be provided. They are not intended to be, nor shall they be construed as, limiting specifications or requirements. At a minimum, for the units the contractor shall be performed all measures which would be taken by a prudent manufacturer to maximize the life expectancy and minimize downtime of related systems and ensure safe and reliable operation. 

All 17 TotalCare Basic and 92 VersCare beds shall be maintained in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations, the best practices of the industry, and applicable codes, standards, and regulations. If a conflict arises between these standards, the most stringent will prevail. 

The Contractor shall provide qualified personnel with an approved vendor clearance to gather and deliver all Hill-Rom hospital beds covered under this contract for maintenance throughout the medical center.  In the event that the unit needs extensive repair and have to be shipped out, the vendor will provide pertinent shipping materials and pre-paid shipping labels. Vendor will take full responsibility during this process. 

All scheduled work that requires a Hill-Rom unit to be taken out of service shall be coordinated with the COTR or designee and the contractor shall report to the COTR or designee the status of equipment or systems not operating by the close of each workday. Any equipment or system not operational by the official start time of the occupants shall be reported to the COTR or designee by 8:00 a.m. that day. The contractor shall be responsible for the installation of signs as related to equipment and/or systems as deemed necessary by the COTR or designee. In the event a Hillrom unit is identified as defective and requires repair, a "defective sign" must be placed on each unit until unit has been repaired or error has been rectified.  

The Contractor shall maintain the machinery spaces, shops and storage areas in a clean and orderly manner. When work is performed in these areas, the Contractor's personnel shall clean up all debris and leave the area in a presentable condition. The Contractor must obtain the approval of the COTR or designee before storing anything in equipment spaces. Operating supplies such as lubricants, rags, cleaners, etc., shall be properly secured in containers approved by the COTR or designee. Storage shall not negatively impact the means of egress, fire protection systems, and emergency lighting; nor, shall it significantly increase the amount of combustible material in the equipment space. Safety requirements shall be maintained as required by NFPA, the National Electrical Code and the manufacturer recommendations.

PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS

1.	MATERIALS TO BE FURNISHED: The Contractor shall furnish all lubricants, test equipment, cleaning supplies, parts and tools necessary to perform the work described above.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION, Midwest Regional Office, National Park Service

1.0	Description

The Midwest Regional Office in support of the National Park Service is seeking information on how an interested contractor could implement a fully integrated credit card solution which addresses EMV/Pin and Chip/P2PE services with electronic cash registers. This solution must be for hardware, software, and card processing.

The President issued an executive order that states In order to strengthen data security and thereby better protect citizens doing business with the Government, executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall, as soon as possible, transition payment processing terminals and credit, debit, and other payment cards to employ enhanced security features, including chip-and-PIN technology. The National Park Service wishes to deploy a solution that addresses not only the executive order but to reduce the scope of compliance on each park who accepts credit cards.  

In addition to pin/chip/emv this has to be accomplished by using a Using a point to point encryption (P2PE) solution. P2PE involves encrypting the cardholder data with a hardware device at the point of swipe, and having the data sent in encrypted form only to the processor (Vantiv), who then decrypts it. This technology ensures that cardholder data never enters any POS unit or network component in an unencrypted form.

2.0	This is a Request for Information Only  

This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes  it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.  The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential requirement. Responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method. The Major Acquisition Buying Office in the Midwest Regional Regional Office of the National Park Service is conducting market research to understand the numbers and types of contractors who have the capability and are interested in providing a fully integrated credit card solution as outlined below. 

This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  Further, the National Park Service is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals.  Respondees are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested partys expense.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  

The solicitation number is P14PS00413, and is issued as a Request for Quotation. 

The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-78 effective through December 26, 2014.

DESCRIPTION:  The National Park Service (NPS), Lake Roosevelt National Recreation Area (LARO), has a requirement for a vendor to process fee collection in accordance with the following tasks:  

(A)	National Park Service delivers sealed bank bags to the contractor once a week.  The contractor has 5 days to complete the tasks.
(B)	Each campground/boat launch bag is opened and two of the contractors employees count the envelopes, the count is marked on each facility slip and initialed by both employees and then the envelopes are returned to the original bag.
(C)	An employee takes one bag and opens each envelope and verifies the cash and checks.  This is done by indicating on each envelope whether it is cash, check, or Canadian funds and making the necessary notations when amount does not match what is stated on the envelope.
(D)	Once the contents of the bag are counted all cash and checks must be balanced with the corresponding envelopes.  This is done by running a total on the cash envelopes and the check envelopes as well as the Canadian funds envelopes.  Then total the cash, checks and Canadian funds to make sure they correspond to the envelopes.  Any discrepancy must be resolved before the funds are given to the teller for verification and deposit.  The employee then marks on the facility slip the total cash, checks, and Canadian funds, and initials the slip.  Deposit ticket number must be placed on each slip.
(E)	Once the teller receives the funds they must verify the cash to the facility slip.  The funds are then deposited to a National park Service general ledger account and immediately withdrawn in cashier check form.  The teller then initials the facility slip indicating that the cash verified balances to the slip.  If Canadian funds are involved the teller must calculate the exchange and note it on the slip.
(F)	Once all the bags are completed, separate the campground slips and the boat launch slips and run a total of the cash funds received for each.  Do the same for all checks received.
(G)	Next take all the slips and total all cash, checks and Canadian funds received and get a Park wide total.  Also make a Park wide total of envelopes received and verify it to the total provided by the Park Service.
(H)	Once everything balances all checks must be stamped (stamp is provided by the Park Service).   This can be anywhere from 50-400 checks per week.
(I)	Each campground/boat launch facility slip must be photocopied and the corresponding receipts to the copies retained by the contracting facility and the originals made ready to the Park Service.
(J)	Call the Fee Manger with deposit breakdown (BL totals, CG totals and total deposit).  The Fee Manager will prepare a deposit ticket, fax it to bank/credit union, and then the prepared ticket and the copies are put with the appropriate checks or paper work.  The checks are then bagged for shipment to the Federal Reserve.
(K)	Any Canadian checks must be listed separately on the facility slips.  Call the Fee Manager and a special foreign funds ticket must be prepared. The Fee Manager will fax the special foreign funds ticket to bank/credit union.  The checks are then sent to the appropriate facility.
(L)	The original facility slips and the copies of the deposit tickets (provided by the Park Service) are delivered to the Park Service within 5 working days after receipt.
(M)	Monthly billing is the preferred billing cycle, obtain monthly billing amount by using the weekly facility wide slips and getting a total count of all envelopes processed and total funds collected for the month.
(N)	Any discrepancy between the envelope count provided by the Park Service and that of the contractor must be brought to the attention of the National Park Service contact person immediately.
(O)	All US Funds will be mailed to:
          U.S. Bank
          Las Vegas Cash Vault Mail-In TGA
          P.O. 98999

<p><br /> NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br /> United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time- consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.<br />Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.<br />More information about the Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) can be found at http://www.uscg.mil/acquisition/business/ombudsman.asp<br />Alternative Point of Contact: <br />Dave Tanner<br />Supervisory Contracting Officer<br />United States Coast Guard<br />Medium Range Surveillance Product Line Division <br />Elizabeth City, NC 27909-5001<br />(252) 335-6142<br />david.e.tanner@uscg.mil</p>

characteristics of products that will be satisfactory. Bids offering "equal" products (including products of the brand name manufacturer other than the one described by brand name) will be considered for award if such products are clearly identified in the bids and are determined by the Government to meet fully the salient characteristics requirements listed in the invitation.
(b) Unless the bidder clearly indicates in the bid that the bidder is offering an "equal" product, the bid shall be considered as offering a brand name product referenced in the invitation for bids.
(c)(1) If the bidder proposes to furnish an "equal" product, the brand name, if any, of the product to be furnished shall be inserted in the space provided in the invitation for bids, or such product shall be otherwise clearly identified in the bid.  The evaluation of bids and the determination as to equality of the product offered shall be the responsibility of the Government and will be based on information furnished by the bidder or identified in his/her bid as well as other information reasonably available to the purchasing activity.  CAUTION TO BIDDERS.  The purchasing activity is not responsible for locating or securing any information that is not identified in the bid and reasonably available to the purchasing activity.  Accordingly, to insure that sufficient information is available, the bidder must furnish as a part of his/her bid all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings or other information) necessary for the purchasing activity to:
(i) Determine whether the product offered meets the salient characteristics requirement of the Invitation for Bids, and
(ii) Establish exactly what the bidder proposes to furnish and what the Government would be binding itself to purchase by making an award. The information furnished may include specific references to information previously furnished or to information otherwise available to the purchasing activity.
(2) If the bidder proposes to modify a product so as to make it conform to the requirements of the Invitation for Bids, he/she shall: 
(i) Include in his/her bid a clear description of such proposed modifications, and 
(ii) Clearly mark any descriptive material to show the proposed modifications.

<p>7.  PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:  Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of General Counsel (GC) supports the mission of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) by providing timely legal advice to program offices and representing the agency in all legal matters. This position is in the practice group within the Office of GC that supports USAID's Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and Bureau for Food Security (BFS). The Attorney will serve as counsel for DCHA, consistent with his/her experience and expertise, with primary responsibilities of providing legal assistance to DCHA's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI). This will consist of interpreting and providing guidance on laws, regulations, and agency policies affecting planned or ongoing OTI programs and operations. A significant component of this work will entail drafting or reviewing documentation, including assistance agreements, connected with the implementation of OTI activities and awards.</p>
<p>Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs. Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet OTI's program objectives and mandate, USAID retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs), including this position in GC to provide legal support for OTI. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits in which USPSCs may participate, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 11 of this solicitation.<br /> <br />For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>As a member of GC/DCHA-BFS, the Attorney supports the mission of USAID by providing timely legal advice to OTI and representing the Agency in all legal matters. In close coordination with, and support of, senior GC/DCHA-BFS attorneys, the Attorney serves as counsel with a broad range of responsibility for OTI and other DCHA affairs on a limited basis. The incumbent provides legal guidance and advice on issues arising in connection with the: operations and administration of the programs carried out by OTI; projects and activities conducted under the authority of the DCHA Assistant Administrator and OTI Director; Congressional, Inspector General, U.S. Government Accountability Office, and public inquiries with respect to DCHA/OTI matters and activities of all areas of responsibility; working relationships with other U.S. Government agencies and international institutions; and legal interpretations of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, predecessor legislation, foreign operations appropriations legislation, and all other Acts pertinent to foreign assistance programs.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

Pricing Information. <br />(1) Schedule B Submission<br />a. Submit completed copy of the Government-provided Schedule B containing the Offeror's proposed amounts. Enter pricing only on the Government Schedule B. Offeror shall NOT alter the Schedule B in any way with the exception of entering pricing. If the Schedule B is found to be altered in any way other than entering pricing, the action will be considered unacceptable and consequently, a reason to reject an Offeror's proposal. Schedule B unit prices shall be limited to two decimal places. <br />b. Identify a CLIN/SLIN (Contract Line Item/Sub Line Item) as "Not Separately Priced" by entering "NSP" in the unit price.

Enter only the amount that is documented as applicable and allowable. Inclusion of any amount that is not documented may render the proposal being rejected.

<p>(c) Period of Acceptance of Offers. The Offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 120 days from the date specified for receipt of offers.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. If more than one solution to the services is available, Offeror may submit multiple offers for consideration, subject to same page limitations. Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided. Failure to include exceptions will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, applies to this solicitation along with the following addenda to the provision:<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. The basis for award will be use of best value in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award a CSA for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence of being a telecommunications company and owning most of the facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services. <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority (SPCOA) , or Certificate of Operating Authority (COA)) with the state PUC where services are being provided.

<p>IAW FAR Part 36.602-2(a) nongovernmental private practitioners of architecture, engineering, and related professions employed by the Civil Engineer Service Provider may be members of the evaluation boards. Contract(s) awarded under this announcement is subject to the Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of Interest (OCI) requirements IAW FAR Subpart 9.5. To avoid conflicts of interest, the A-E firm and its subsidiaries, affiliates, or associates will not be permitted to construct or repair any facility they have been selected to design unless agency approval is granted. Firms are advised to review the referenced FAR Part and include a subsequent acknowledgement and statement of understanding of the requirement as the last item in the SF 330 Part I Block H. Failure to include this signed statement within the SF 330 will negate consideration of the firm for this solicitation. No construction contract may be awarded to the firm that designed the project, except as provided in FAR 36.209. Foreign firms will not be considered for award of an A-E contract.</p>
<p>EVALUATION and SELECTION CRITERIA: In accordance with PL 92-582 (Brooks Act; 40 U.S.C. 1102), Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 36.6, DFARS 236.6 and AFI 32-1023, federal agencies select firms for Architect-Engineering contracts based on professional qualifications and other evaluation and selection criteria. To be considered for award, the principal firm must submit a completed Standard Form 330 (SF330), Part I &amp; II, summarizing their qualifications, experience and capabilities, which will be evaluated by a government board to determine the most highly qualified firms. All responsive offers will be placed into one of two pools to compete - small business and large business. Both pools have the same evaluation criteria, listed below. Firms submitting recent (within the past 5 years), and relevant past performance in preparing design projects valued between $100K and $5M may result in a higher rating and should be addressed accordingly. Evaluation of past performance and experience may include information provided by the firm, customer inquiries, Government databases, and publicly available sources. Failure to provide requested data, accessible points of contact, or valid phone numbers could result in a firm being considered less qualified.</p>
<p>The A-E firm selected for this contract will be based on the following evaluation factors:</p>
<p>1. PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS. Evaluations will award up to 20 points based on their judgment of professional qualifications of their staff and other firm staff submitted as part of the team. SF 330, Part I, Block E, should show brief resumes of key personnel of the firm/teaming arrangement. The combination of criteria below will be used to determine the ability of the staff to be effective, innovative and contribute to the successful completion of project delivery orders. Responses will be evaluated to determine personnel: education, training, project experience and professional registration of key personnel. Evaluations will also judge the depth and experience of the firm and other firms submitted as part of the team. Consider the type and quantity of projects the firm (and associates) have been involved in the past. The preferred profile code numbers from Standard Form 330 for the type of work required include, but are not limited to the following:</p>
<p>a. A09-Anti-Terrorism/Force Protection <br />b. A10-Asbestos Abatement<br />c. C18-Cost Estimating; Cost Engineering &amp; Analysis; Parametric Costing; Forecasting<br />d. E01-Ecological &amp; Archeological Investigations<br />e. E03-Electrical Studies and Design <br />f. E09-Environmental Impact Studies, Assessments or Statements <br />g. F05-Forensic Engineering <br />h. H04-Heating; Ventilating; Air Conditioning<br />i. H07-Highways; Streets; Airfield Paving; Parking Lots<br />j. H08-Historical Preservation<br />k. I05- Interior Design; Space Planning<br />l. L03-Landscape Architecture<br />m. L05-Lighting (Interior; Display; Theater; Etc.)<br />n. O01-Office Buildings; Industrial Parks <br />o. P12-Power Generation, Transmission, Distribution<br />p. R06-Rehabilitation (Building; Structures; Facilities)<br />q. R12-Roofing <br />r. S11-Sustainable Design<br />s. T03-Traffic and Transportation Engineering <br />t. U03-Utilities (Gas and Steam) <br /><br />2. SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE. Evaluations will award up to 20 points based on specialized experience of the firm's staff (refer to SF 330 Part I, Blocks F and G) to the typical requirements that may be generated as part of this scope of work. SF 330, Part I, Block F, list only current projects or projects completed in the past five years. Projects completed more recently will be evaluated more advantageously for the offeror. These projects should show scope and nature similar to the USAFA A-E services requirements, the complexity of the job, challenges faced, actions taken and the resolution and results of any challenges faced, as well as identify any key personnel in SF 330 Part I, Block G that worked on the projects and their role. Provide demonstrated successes in specifying the use of recovered materials in construction, and achieving pollution prevention, waste reduction, and energy conservation in facility design, as identified in the SF 330 Part I, Block H. The contractor should also identify if the prime or its associates have at least one Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Accredited Professional as defined by the US Green Building Council. The contractor should also identify LEED awards and ratings achieved by the firm and its associates.</p>
<p>3. PROFESSIONAL CAPACITY. Evaluations will award up to 20 points to judge the capacity of the firm to accomplish the requirement in the scope of work in the required time. Within the SF 330, Part I, Block H, each firm shall demonstrate how they will manage, coordinate and administer the work within the prime and among any teaming partners. Teaming partners to be included by the prime contractor in their response should be clearly identified as such for evaluation purposes and will later be agreed to during negotiations of any resultant contract. SF 330, Part II, Block 11 and the CONUS/OCONUS information required under criteria (5) to be provided in SF 330, Part I, Block H will also be evaluated to assist in determining this factor. SF 330, Part I, Blocks C and F may also be evaluated to support this criterion. SF 330, Part IIs shall be provided for the specific prime office expected to lead this effort and teaming partners proposed to perform the work. In Block 9c(1), enter the total number of employees for the firm and in Block 9c(2) enter the total number of employees for this office. Responses will be evaluated to determine the following requirements:<br />a. Capacity to perform work in-house and with teaming members in the required time;<br />b. Ability to support concurrent and geographically dispersed multi-million dollar projects;<br />c. Ability to manage, coordinate, and administer work within prime and among teaming members;<br />d. Demonstrate active on-going CONUS, Alaska and Hawaii, (domestic) work; (Address current dollar value of work of the Team, established Team and Prime office that can support such work and work requirements outlined in the USAFA A-E services requirements and management approach to on-going work.)</p>
<p>4. PAST PERFORMANCE. Evaluations will award up to 20 points based on evaluation of past performance of the firm with respect to their execution of DoD and other contracts, both Government and private. SF 330, Part I, Block H, cite examples of performance and customer satisfaction such as recognition for technical achievements, cost savings, or commendations received for projects similar to the scope of work. Responses will be evaluated to determine design constructability, cost control, quality of work, compliance with performance schedules and customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>5. LOCATION. All firms responding to the RFQ will be considered. However, the evaluations will award up to 10 points according to the firm's location in the general geographic area and knowledge of the locality of the project to USAFA and other authorized Department of Defense (DoD) installations, to include Buckley, Cheyenne Mountain, Fort Carson, F.E. Warren, Peterson and Schriever.</p>
<p>6. VOLUME OF WORK. Evaluations will consider the volume of work previously awarded to the firm by the DoD and will award up to 10 points with the objective of effecting an equitable distribution of DoD contracts among qualified A-E firms, i.e., firms with a greater number of contracts or volume of work with DoD should be awarded less points and vice versa. SF 330, Part I, Block H should clearly identify, in table format similar to SF 330, Part II, Block 11, the volume of DoD work and volume of CONUS, Alaska and Hawaii, (domestic) work for the prime contractor. Amounts should represent the total amount of any DoD contract vehicle in which obligation of funds has occurred in the previous 12 months from the date of this announcement. Note that the volume of CONUS, Alaska and Hawaii, is for all work (federal, DoD, and other).</p>
<p>7. INTERVIEW/DISCUSSION. The Final Selection Board may award up to 15 additional points for interviews conducted by phone, as determined by the Final Selection Board. These 15 points may be awarded on, but not limited to, the following criteria: clear understanding of the scope of work, examples of outstanding past performance, customer responsiveness, examples of projects completed ahead of schedule, use of creativity and imagination in design development, and response to questions from Final Selection Board members.</p>
<p>TEAMING AGREEMENTS: The prime contractor shall provide a statement in the cover letter confirming executed teaming agreements are in place for all team members listed in the proposal. The statement shall also list all team members.</p>
<p>All evaluation factors are significantly more important than price, as price is not being evaluated at this time. Factors (1), (2), (3) and (4) are of equal importance and significantly more important than factors (5) and (6). Factors (5) and (6) are of equal importance. Factor (7) may be applied at the Final Selection Board and used in the event of a tie. Selection of firms shall be through an order of preference based on qualifications necessary for the satisfactory performance of the type of professional services described above.</p>
<p>A Pre-Selection and Final Selection board(s) or only a Final Selection Board may be held if determined to be in the best interest of the government. The Pre-Selection Board will use evaluation factors (1) through (6) to determine the firms that will be recommended to the Final Selection Board. The Final Selection Board will also use the evaluation factors (1) through (6) to score the Final-Selection Board recommended firms. The Final Selection Board's subtotals will be recorded. If needed, the Final Selection Board will further evaluate these firms based on interview/discussion/briefings from evaluation factor (7) and record their scores (worth 15 points). These scores will be added to the previous subtotals to arrive at a total point value that will determine the order of recommending the preferred candidates to the contracting officer.</p>
<p>The Government&lsquo;s evaluation and selection of firms are based on a pre-selection board which identifies the ranking of firms to determine the most highly qualified firms in each pool. The most highly qualified firms that will proceed to the final selection board will be based on the logical break. It is anticipated that at least two of those firms will be small business. Ranking is based on the point system identified in the evaluation criteria. The Government reserves the right to only conduct a final-selection board. The Government will conduct negotiations IAW FAR Part 15 to determine price. The top two/three highest ranked small business firms and the top two/three highest ranked large business firms, depending on the quality of proposals received, will receive a request for price proposal (RFPP) and negotiations will be conducted with those firms. The other most highly qualified firms will receive a letter stating they are among the most highly qualified, but a RFPP is not yet being requested. If a mutually satisfactory contract cannot be negotiated, the contracting officer shall obtain a written final proposal revision from the firm, and notify the firm that negotiations have been terminated. The contracting officer shall then initiate negotiations with the next firm on the final selection list. All other offerors not in the pool of most highly qualified firms will receive an unsuccessful letter. When design authorization and funding is received, a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) for the first specific design project will be issued to and negotiated with the most highly qualified firm.</p>
<p>There is no RFPP package to download. A-E firms, which meet the requirements described in this announcement, are invited to submit completed Standard Form (SF) 330, Architect-Engineer Qualification. All information relating to the firm's qualifications must be contained in the SF 330 (Part I &amp; Part II).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When determining recency, relevancy and assigning a past performance confidence rating, the government will consider the type of experience, the amount of experience, and the ability of contractor to meet customer needs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>b.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will not be considered as highly as past performance information from the principal quoter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Quoters with no relevant past or present performance history or the quoter's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned shall receive the rating "Unknown Past Performance," meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>If the prime contractor has no past performance and is relying on their subcontractor's past performance, the prime contractor will be assessed an "Unknown Past Performance" rating.</p>

<p>c.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In evaluating past performance, the government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.</p>

<p>f.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Quoters are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in their quote preparation instructions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Quoters may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their quote or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Adverse past performance is defined as past performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

If the offeror certifies to the conditions in paragraph (a) of this provision, and the Contracting Officer determines in accordance with FAR 22.1003-4(c) (3) that the Service Contract Act- <br />(1) Will not apply to this offeror, then the Service Contract Act of 1965 clause in this solicitation will not be included in any resultant contract to this offeror; or <br />(2) Will apply to this offeror, then the clause at 52.222-51, Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Act to Contracts for Maintenance, Calibration, or Repair of Certain Equipment-Requirements, in this solicitation will not be included in any resultant contract awarded to this offeror, and the offeror may be provided an opportunity to submit a new offer on that basis. <br />(c) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (a) of this provision- <br />(1) The clause in this solicitation at 52.222-51, Exemption from Application of the Service Contract Act to Contracts for Maintenance, Calibration, or Repair of Certain Equipment-Requirements, will not be included in any resultant contract awarded to this offeror; and <br />(2) The offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible, if the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation. <br />(d) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror, if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (a) of this provision or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (c) of this provision.</p>
<p>The provision at FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items is applicable to this solicitation.</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the lowest priced, technically acceptable responsible offeror. The lowest priced offer will be evaluated first. If the lowest priced offeror is not technically acceptable, the next lowest priced offer will be evaluated and so on until a technically acceptable offer is determined.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION, Midwest Regional Office, National Park Service

1.0	Description

The Midwest Regional Office in support of the National Park Service is seeking information on how an interested contractor could implement a fully integrated credit card solution which addresses EMV/Pin and Chip/P2PE services with electronic cash registers. This solution must be for hardware, software, and card processing.

The President issued an executive order that states In order to strengthen data security and thereby better protect citizens doing business with the Government, executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall, as soon as possible, transition payment processing terminals and credit, debit, and other payment cards to employ enhanced security features, including chip-and-PIN technology. The National Park Service wishes to deploy a solution that addresses not only the executive order but to reduce the scope of compliance on each park who accepts credit cards.  

In addition to pin/chip/emv this has to be accomplished by using a Using a point to point encryption (P2PE) solution. P2PE involves encrypting the cardholder data with a hardware device at the point of swipe, and having the data sent in encrypted form only to the processor (Vantiv), who then decrypts it. This technology ensures that cardholder data never enters any POS unit or network component in an unencrypted form.

2.0	This is a Request for Information Only  

This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes  it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.

Therefore, we recommend that you monitor the Federal Business Opportunities site at http://www.fbo.gov for all information relevant to desired acquisitions.

Business type (large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a)-certified small disadvantaged business, HUBZone small business, woman-owned small business, very small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business) shall be determined based upon North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541512, Computer Systems Design Services.  Small business concern means a concern, including its affiliates, that is independently owned and operated, not dominant in the field of operation in which it is bidding on Government contracts, and qualified as a small business under the criteria and size standards in 13 CFR part 121. A small business concern for the purposes of this procurement is generally defined as a business, including its affiliates, averaging no more than  $27.5 million dollars in annual receipts.  Annual receipts of a concern that has been in business for 3 or more complete fiscal years means the annual average gross revenue of the concern taken for the last 3 fiscal years.  Annual receipts of a concern that has been in business for less than 3 complete fiscal years means its total receipts for the period it has been in business, divided by the number of weeks including fractions of a week that it has been in business, and multiplied by 52.  Respondees are cautioned, however, that this is a general description only.   Complete information on SBA size standards can be found online at:  https://www.sba.gov/content/small-business-size-standards

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest. 

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer.  If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. 

The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<DESC>The following questions were asked concerning this solicitation. Answers follow.
<p><br />Q) On CLIN 1 items #8 calls for the material to be steel. Is there a certain grade of steel that should be used? A36hot roll or 1018 cold roll or something else?</p>
<p>A) CG specification P-420-0334 cites ASTM A36/A 36M, Requirements for Carbon Structural Steel, Shapes, Plates and Bars, which cites ASTM A6/A6M, Standard Specification for General Requirements for Rolled Structural Steel Bars, Plates, Shapes, and Sheet Piling, regarding supplemental requirements.<br />Apply the material chemical composition listed in Table 2, of A36, for hot-rolled carbon steel BARS. That composition of steel is acceptable for producing the buoy gong tapper assembly (NSN 2050-01-019-0107) tapper rod, item #8 in CG drawing 121159 Rev D.</p>
<p>___________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Exhibit #1, 2050-01-334-9293</p>
<p>1. We are quoting the short tapper assembly, correct?<br />ANSWER: No. 2050-01-334-9293 is a short (25 inch) top mark stand. Use spec # P-420-0099 and drawing 121138 for this item. Please note: The short tapper assembly NSN is, 2050-01-025-3526. Use Spec P-420-0334 and drawing 121159 for the tapper.</p>
<p>2. Can we substitute 316 SS for the Wrought iron on Item#12 or does it have to be wrought iron? Is there any other material that could be used? <br />ANSWER: Wrought iron is required for manufacturing item #12, small tapper ball, on drawing 121159, Buoy Bell and Gong Tappers. This material ensures that proper sound is produced when buoy bells and gongs are struck by the ball. Please note: There is no item #12 listed in materials on drawing 121138, Lantern Bridge and Top Mark Stands .</p>
<p><br />Exhibit #2, 2050-01-334-9293</p>
<p>1. Are Items #6 and #7 to be included in our proposal? If so, we need more details.<br />ANSWER: No. Item #6 and #7, on drawing 121138, are to be provided and attached to the stand by CG unit end users.</p>
<p>2. We are quoting the short stand, correct?<br />ANSWER: That is correct, the short (25 inch) top mark stand. Use Spec P-420-0099 and drawing 121138.</p>
<p><br />Exhibit #3, 5840-01-043-6233</p>
<p>1. For the top (Items #2 and #3) Could we quote this as (1) piece with no welding? Flanged only head<br />ANSWER: Yes, you may quote material items #2, ring and #3, top plate from drawing 120316 as a single stamped piece. Note: You may also quote material items #4, ring and #5, bottom ring as one piece, if you have the capability of stamping the larger bottom plate. Note: Ensure the finished bend adheres to drawing 120316 Section C-C for the top plate and Section D-D for the bottom plate.</p>
<p>Exhibit #4, 5840-01-261-9882</p>
<p>1. For the top (Items #2 and #3) Could we quote this as (1) piece with no welding? Flanged only head<br />ANSWER: Yes, you may quote material items #2, top plate/bottom plate and #3, top flange/bottom flange from drawing 121024 as single stamped pieces. Note: Ensure the finished bend adheres to drawing 121024 Section A-A for the top plate and Section B-B for the bottom plate.</p>
<p>Exhibit #5, 6117-01-334-9295</p>
<p>1. Are we to include Items #11 and #12 in our proposal? <br />ANSWER: Yes. The stuffing tube and packing gland must be provided IAW Spec P-422-0377, Fabrication Of Aluminum Solar Panel Frames.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to correct previous Size Standard listed in Section 10 of SF 1449 and address questions from Offerors. 
 As a result of this amendment said Size Standard has changed from $10.50 million to $38.5 million for NAICS 562112. 
Questions and answers are listed below.  
1.	The Price/Cost Schedule in the bid form lists "regulated" and "deregulated" vials and fluids (CLIN 0003 through 0005).  Would you kindly define the use of those terms?  In other words, is the waste regulated because of its radioactivity content, or is it regulated because of its hazardous constituents (i.e., toluene vs aqueous solutions)?
ANSWER: There are two categories of waste with the disposal of liquid scintillation fluids. The two must be kept separate for purposes of disposal. Vials or bulk quantities of liquid scintillation fluids or organic solvents containing radionuclides other than H-3 or C-14, with activities of less than 0.05 uCi/ml are considered regulated liquid scintillation fluids, and as such are considered radioactive.  Vials or bulk quantities of scintillation fluid or organic solvents containing only H-3 and C-14, with activities less than 0.05 uCi/ml are considered deregulated liquid scintillation fluids, and may be handled as a chemical waste. (Short answer: because of its radioactivity content).
2.	To ensure appropriate treatment of waste prior to disposal, kindly advise as to the RCRA or other toxic/hazardous constituents that will be in any of the waste forms (i.e., CLIN 0001 through 0006)  to be disposed of under this contract.
ANSWER: No other toxic or hazardous constituents will be present.  Some waste will contain blood or blood product mixed in aqueous solution and other is liquid scintillation fluid.
3.    Kindly provide a listing of the radionuclides that may be present in CLIN 0001 through 0006.
ANSWER: Cr-51, H-3, C-14, Ca-45, P32, Rb-86, Na-22, S-35, I-125, Co-57, Ge-68, Uranium from Uranyl Acetate and Uranyl Nitrate. 
4	Will the waste to be disposed of under this contract be staged for a single pickup during the base year and for each of the optional years, or does the VA Medical Center desire "on demand" pickups?  If the latter, kindly advise as to how many pickups per year are likely for transportation pricing purposes.
ANSWER: On demand with approximately two to four pickups per year.
5.    Are the containers to be provided for waste staging to be delivered once during the base year and each of the optional years, or does the VA Medical Center desire "on demand" container delivery?  If the latter, kindly advise as to how many containers and deliveries are likely for pricing purposes.
ANSWER: On demand with approximately five boxes (18"x18"x24") and 1 pail (5 gallons) per      pickup and one drum of liquid scintillation vial per year.
6.    Will the waste to be disposed of under this contract be staged in a single location at the VA Medical Center, or is the winning contractor required to pick-up and consolidate the waste prior to shipping?  If the latter, will a work area with tractor/trailer access (loading dock) be provided in order to perform the necessary consolidation, packaging, and manifesting?
              ANSWER: Staged at the VA Medical Center until ready for pickup.

<DESC>2. For section 4.5.8. it was discussed to perform primary current injection testing of all circuit breakers at 300% for time-current verification. The spec calls for the breakers to be tested at 3 multiples of relay tap current. Is it correct to say that the intent is to test the breakers at 300% only? No response. Follow  SOW at this time.
3. Is there a breaker size cutoff for primary current testing. Industry standard is to test all breakers 400A and above. No response. Follow SOW at this time.
4. Section 4.5.9. states that an Infrared scan be performed on the electrical distribution system. Will this IR scan take place prior to the commencement of the PM in order to outline the problem areas and be able to perform any repairs as needed? Yes it can be done prior.
5. What size of 480-208Y120 dry-type transformers do you wish to have serviced in coordination with the PM? And are you intending on just the transformers in the rooms outlined in the spec to be serviced?  Include all existing dry type transformer in all Buildings. This Information is on the One Lines drawings.
6. Request one-line drawings. Done.
7. Request coordination study for settings verification. Done.
8. It was noticed that a few of the transformers had a vacuum of about 1-2 psi which can be detrimental to the insulation of the transformer. Would you like us to add in the proposal the cost of placing a dry Nitrogen blanket of 1-2 psi of pressure on the transformers? "Add this item as a deduct option.

<p>The purpose of this synopsis is to inform the market that the Air Force intends to solicit Thales Visionix, Inc. on a sole-source basis to negotiate an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for the procurement of Repair and Replacement of the Scorpion <sup>TM</sup> Helmet Mounted Cueing System (HMCS) Equipment to support the A-10 aircraft HMCS program. The proposed NAICS Code is 334511, Search, Detection, Navigation, Guidance, Aeronautical, and Nautical System and Instrument Manufacturing, which has a corresponding size standard of 750 employees.</p>
<p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></p>
<p>Based on FAR 6.302-1 - Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The proposed contract action is one for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source. If your firm does not agree with this determination, please provide evidence of your firm's capabilities and experience in providing the above services for evaluation. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This request is to receive support from Thales Visionix, Inc. March 2015 until March 2017.</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p>
<p>The A-10 aircraft users have integrated the Thales Visionix, Inc. (TVI) Scorpion<sup>TM</sup> Helmet Mounted Cueing System (HMCS) Equipment into war fighting capabilities. The HMCS components were developed solely by TVI and due to the proprietary nature of this specialized technology it is not commercially available, which makes TVI the only firm capable of meeting the technical requirement to diagnose, repair and replace the Scorpion<sup>TM</sup> HMCS equipment..</p>
<p><strong>OBJECTIVE</strong></p>
<p>This effort is to procure Repair and Replacement of the Scorpion<sup>TM</sup> Helmet Mounted Cueing System (HMCS) Equipment for the A-10 aircraft HMCS program. The Contractor will have to develop and perform testing and evaluation in order to diagnose, repair and/or replace various parts of the HMCS equipment. The contractor will also need to provide various reports and records to help improve program sustainability,&nbsp;knowledge, and capability. Due to the proprietary nature of this requirement, the Contractor must have applied knowledge of the Scorpion<sup>TM</sup> Helmet Mounted Cueing System (HMCS) Equipment</p>
<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>
<p>This is not a request for proposal (RFP) or an invitation for bid, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government. The Government does not intend to make an award on the basis of this synopsis.</p>

<br /><br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">****************************************************************<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp; Sources Sought Synopsis:<br />THIS DOCUMENT IS FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL/QUOTE. </span>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Air Force Security Assistance and Cooperation (AFSAC) Directorate located at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base OH anticipates a competitive acquisition to provide acquisition services for non-standard and difficult to purchase standard items in support of foreign military sales. This tri-service contract will support FMS Air Force, Navy and Army requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Contract Effort Description: The Parts Repair Ordering System (PROS) Program contractor is responsible for the purchase of supply items, maintenance services and the management of task orders. The contract is managed by a dedicated program office at AFSAC that oversees the contractor's performance and monitors the flow of FMS requirements to the contractor. The objectives of PROS are to provide timely support, competitive pricing, quality service and quality program management to the FMS customer. The PROS program goal is to provide "one stop shopping" for the FMS country. The current contract structure consists of indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ), period of performance June 2012 - June 2017 (3-year base period with 2 one-year options), firm fixed price (fill fees), firm fixed price and cost reimbursable (task orders), cost reimbursable (pass through subcontractor costs) and an Objective Performance Incentive (OPI) . NOTE: The contemplated period of performance for this acquisition is 5-7 years, with a 3-6 month ramp up period to create and implement a procurement software system capable of interfacing with AFSAC's Security Assistance Management Information System (SAMIS), along with a logistics transition phase between the current and subsequent contractor. Government requests industry feedback on contemplated Period of Performance (PoP) and suggested ramp up period required in order for USG to solicit realistic time frames.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Historical Environment: Approximately 75% of current supply actions are one-time only actions. The 90+ plus users of the contract provide no computation of failure rates. The lack of repeat actions and no provision of failure rate computations make predicting future requirements impossible. Approximately 75% of current supply actions are non-standard, that is-- not stored, stocked, issued or managed by the US Air Force and usually there is not a National Stock Number (NSN). The standard items with a NSN (remaining 25%) supported on this contract are waived by the USAF for supply action usually due to inability to meet an established need date. However, the managing US DoD source of supply restricts acquisitions to only US DoD approved sources. Approximately 22,000 supply requisitions and 4,500 maintenance requisitions are issued per year. Approximately 80% of the contract actions are supply with the remainder being maintenance and task orders.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This contractual effort is for a commercial buying service. The majority of the contract value is pass-through costs to the vendor/manufacturer/repair service/task order sub-contractor of the item/service. The successful bidder for this contract will earn a small portion of the total estimated value of the contract. The probable (contract structure is not currently finalized) sources of revenue for the successful bidder will be specific fixed fee charges for specific buying type services identified in the contract schedule and OPI. The successful bidder shall have total liability for Supply Discrepancy Reports (SDRs). This will include residual SDRs filed up to the allowable one year after shipment of an item even though the contract-ordering period may have been completed several years before. The successful bidder shall be advised to make arrangements to address this potential liability. <br />NOTE: The SDR process has been problematic in previous contracts. It is our desire to clearly establish roles and responsibilities with respect to SDRs. We request industry comments on structuring SDR liability and resolution. Generally orders are for small quantities, no large production runs. A significant amount of total contract value amount is pass-through costs for procuring required parts and services.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Desirable Features: Competitive environment for the contractor to drive performance; current contract contains a 90% effective competition rate. Leverage commercial marketplace for fostering synergistic partnerships with OEMs, online inventory for customer/contractor reference. Desire cost savings - best available price - minimizing participation fees, turn-around time - shortest possible lead-time - lead-time from after receipt of order to shipment. Goal- Design mission support strategies that obtain higher levels of contractor performance, foster synergistic partnerships, accommodate changing or unforeseen mission needs, and leverage commercial best practices.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information is being collected from all potential sources at this time. Small business and other than small business participation is encouraged. Each company responding should indicate their business size in relation to the stated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code size standard. The NAICS assigned to this acquisition is 541614, "Process, Physical Distribution, and Logistics Consulting", with a size standard of $15M. Your response must also indicate all socio-economic small business categories for which you qualify; small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a), woman-owned, economically disadvantaged women-owned, veteran-owned, service-disabled veteran-owned, and HUBZone. All prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (www.sam.gov) database to be awarded a DOD contract. Respondents are further requested to indicate their status as a Foreign-owned/foreign-controlled firm and any contemplated use of foreign national employees on this effort. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that small business prime contractors must perform at least 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14. If you are a Small Business and you intend to subcontract a portion of this effort, please explain in your response how you intend to meet the 50% performance requirement. Additionally, firms having GSA schedules should indicate their GSA schedule number in their responses.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Any information submitted by respondents to this sources sought synopsis is voluntary. This sources sought notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government reimburse any costs associated with the submission of information in response to this notice. Respondents will not be individually notified of the results of any government assessments.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Capabilities Package. All interested firms should submit capability packages that outline their capability to provide the required purchase of supply items, maintenance services and the management of task orders. Additionally, interested firms should specifically state how they intend to meet the 3-6 month ramp up after contract award and discuss their capability to be fully operational within that time frame. Also, include any comments/suggestions on structuring SDR liability and resolution. The capabilities package should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements. Recent, relevant experience and/or capabilities in all areas should be provided. Recent, relevant experience is defined as performance of the same or similar work within the past three (3) years. If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large businesses will be used. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided. The response must not exceed 10 pages. Submit capabilities packages via e-mail to Tammy Tobe; tamara.tobe@us.af.mil. All correspondence sent via email shall contain a subject line that reads "Parts Ordering Repair Service-PROS." If this subject line is not included, the email may not get through email filters at Wright-Patterson AFB. Filters are designed to delete emails without a subject or with a suspicious subject or attachments. Attachments with files ending in .zip or .exe are not allowable and will be deleted. Ensure only .pdf, .doc, or .xls documents are attached to your email.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Questions related to this sources sought synopsis must be submitted via e-mail to the person indicated above NLT COB (Monday, 28 July 2014.) No further questions will be entertained after that date.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">RESPONSES ARE DUE NO LATER THAN COB Monday, 18 August 2014.<br />The PROS Program Management Office (PMO) will be hosting an Industry Days event for all interested parties. Information about Industry Days will be posted as a separate notice.</span></p>

<DESC><p><span><strong>INTRODUCTION&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p>On behalf of the federal Mobile Technology Tiger Team (MTTT), a working group level organization within the Information Security and Identity Management Committee (ISIMC) of the Federal CIO Council, the Enterprise Mobility Program within the General Services Administration Office of Integrated Technology Services (ITS) is seeking comments and information related to the commercial factors, capabilities, and considerations for extending the Mobile Security Baseline to cover State, Local Tribal and Territorial (SSLT) entities in an information share scenarios.. This endeavor compliments, but does not duplicate, the efforts being undertaken by FirstNet (the First Responders Network Authority).</p>
<p>The basis for this Request for Information (RFI) is the attached document, a draft version entitled "State, Local Tribal and Territorial Mobile Access to Federal Information Systems: Barriers, Opportunities, and Gaps Analysis." This document is a preparatory step toward publication of a Mobile and Wireless Security Baseline for SLTT entities that will share information on Federal systems.</p>
<p>The analysis of requirements for an SLTT Mobile Security Baseline was conducted during a time of technology transformation in which firms started providing solutions in response to the Federal CIO Council's Government Mobile and Wireless Security Baseline published in May 2013. SLTT entities share sensitive information with Federal Departments and Agencies for activities such as:</p>
<p>&bull; Law Enforcement<br />&bull; The National Suspicious Activity Reporting Initiative<br />&bull; The National Strategy for Information Sharing<br />&bull; Emergency Management and Disaster Recovery<br />&bull; Infectious Disease Control<br />&bull; State and local Fusion Centers</p>
<p><br /><strong>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>This RFI is intended to afford potential vendors an opportunity to comment, identify their technical capabilities, and provide policy considerations and recommendations. The Government is requesting firms provide their technical capabilities, experience, and recommendations as to how companies approach securing and coordinating mobile communications whereby transactional information may be shared between the Federal Government and SLTT entities. The government is also soliciting recommendations as to what to consider from a practical and policy perspective when extending the Mobile Security Baseline to include SLTT entities.</p>
<p>Based on this brief description, as well as the attached draft of "Barriers, Opportunities, and Gaps Analysis" document, the Government is requesting information on how firms go about designing, deploying and operating systems that produce the desired outcome. We are also requesting firms identify considerations, constraints, and recommendations (including Industry best practices) the government should include in developing the policy of extending the Mobile Security Baseline to SLTT entities.</p>
<p>This requirement is in its initial/planning stage and the requested information will afford the MTTT better understand your industry's delivery capabilities and how they will impact the development of security policy in a way that enables continued FirstNet adoption.</p>
<p>This Request for Information does not in any way imply a planned or pending procurement action by the United States Government. Responses to this RFI can not constitute an offer and shall not be accepted as the basis for forming a binding contract. The Government is not seeking proposals at this time and will not accept unsolicited proposals in response to this RFI. The government will not reimburse any respondent for any costs associated with information submitted in response to this RFI.</p>

<DESC><br /><strong>ORNL Sustainable Transportation Program Technical Assistance for US Small Businesses in Vehicle Technologies<br /></strong>
<p><br />Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) is announcing a pilot Technical Assistance Program to help a limited number of American-owned U.S. small businesses commercialize clean transportation technologies.  This opportunity will provide selected participants access to ORNL's experienced staff and unique equipment and capabilities in support of the participants' sustainable transportation research and development activities.</p>
<p><strong>Description<br /></strong><br />UT-Battelle, LLC, acting under its Prime Contract No. DE-AC05-00OR22725 with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for the management and operation of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, conducts research and development in support of the DOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE).  Through its Sustainable Transportation Program (STP), EERE advances the development of next-generation technologies to improve plug-in electric and other alternative-fuel vehicles, advanced combustion engine and vehicle efficiency, and produce low-carbon domestic fuels.</p>
<p>ORNL invites applications from small businesses to participate in this pilot Technical Assistance Program.  Projects will be selected based on the criteria described below and will provide up to approximately 40 hours of ORNL staff effort and the necessary facilities and supplies.  Companies must provide at least 50% cost share, which can be funds-in to ORNL or in-kind contributions (e.g., facilities, services, and staff time).  Company cost share cannot be met using funds from U.S. Government sources. Funds will not be provided to the company by ORNL. Note: THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT REQUEST.</p>
<p><strong>Objective<br /></strong><br />The objective of this pilot program is to help small businesses commercialize clean and efficient transportation technologies by providing technical assistance or information. Examples of available assistance and information include<br />&bull;	Test and measurement of systems or components<br />&bull;	Analytical testing and characterization of materials<br />&bull;	Advising on processing or manufacturing concerns and resolving related technical problems<br />&bull;	Advising on emerging products or processes<br />&bull;	Assistance in addressing general technology performance</p>
<p><strong>Eligibility<br /></strong><br />Participants must be American-owned U.S. small businesses (&lt;500 employees).  Proposed projects must address a technical barrier to market introduction or product quality and must be in one of the following technical areas related to vehicles:</p>
<p>&bull;	Combustion engines<br />&bull;	Emissions systems<br />&bull;	Fuel impacts on engines and emission systems<br />&bull;	Materials for use in propulsion systems</p>
<p>Proposers are encouraged to consult with&nbsp;<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ascii-theme-font:major-latin;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-hansi-theme-font:major-latin;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA"><a href="http://www.ornl.gov/transportation">ORNL STP</a></span>&nbsp;technical staff to develop a work scope that is technically feasible and compatible with ORNL facilities and capabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Application <br /></strong><br />Applications may be submitted at any time via email to Keith Kahl (<a style="font-family: 'Century Gothic', sans-serif;" href="mailto:kahlwk@ornl.gov">kahlwk@ornl.gov</a>) with a subject line of "ORNL STP Technical Assistance."  Applications must be submitted in PDF file format, and may be no longer than five (5) single-spaced pages using a 12-point font (Times New Roman preferred).</p>
<p>To be considered, applications must include the following elements under headings corresponding to the following bullets:</p>
<p>&bull;	Title page (not included in page limit): Project title; company name; company business contact information (name, address, phone number, fax number, email address) for contract topics and for scientific/technical topics; ORNL principal investigator contact information (name, address, phone number, fax number, email address).<br />&bull;	Abstract: Brief, non-proprietary summary of technical objectives and potential impacts of proposed project.<br />&bull;	Background: Technical challenge to be addressed in the project. Identify ORNL capabilities to be used.<br />&bull;	Project Plan and Objectives: Provide a brief research plan and expected utilization of ORNL resources. List clear technical objectives and project tasks. <br />&bull;	Impact: Describe the anticipated energy savings, economic benefit, environmental benefit, or other associated outcomes of a successful project. <br />&bull;	Project Budget (not included in page limit):  Summary of project costs including amount and source of participant cost share.<br />&bull;	Qualifications and Expertise (not included in page limit):  Provide brief biographical information for key company staff involved in the project.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Selection Criteria<br /></strong><br />&bull;	Applications will be considered on a first come, first served basis.<br />&bull;	Projects must take advantage of unique ORNL assets and proposed work must not be able to be reasonably performed by entities in the private sector.<br />&bull;	ORNL staff and equipment time must be available to perform the work.<br />&bull;	Projects must specifically address commercialization or market barriers.<br />&bull;	Projects must be technically sound and aligned with the&nbsp;<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ascii-theme-font:major-latin;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-hansi-theme-font:major-latin;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA"><a href="http://energy.gov/eere/vehicles/vehicle-technologies-office">DOE Vehicle Technologies</a></span>&nbsp;mission.<br />&bull;	Selections will be contingent on availability of funds.</p>
<p><strong>Process<br /></strong><br />Applications will be reviewed by a team comprising ORNL business and research professionals and will be approved by the ORNL STP Director with DOE/HQ concurrence.  Each approved application for a project will be finalized and carried out through a&nbsp;<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ascii-theme-font:major-latin;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-hansi-theme-font:major-latin;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA"><a href="http://www.ornl.gov/File%20Library/Main%20Nav/ORNL/Partnerships/Sponsored%20Research/DOE-483Short-Form-CRADA-6-13.pdf">Short Form Model Cooperative Research And Development Agreement</a></span>&nbsp;(CRADA) signed by ORNL and the participating company.<br />Work can begin once the CRADA is fully executed.  A final letter report, accompanied by an abstract that is suitable for public release, will be generated for each project.</p>
<p><strong>Intellectual Property and Proprietary Data<br /></strong><br />DOE and ORNL respect the importance of industry's intellectual property and data security while balancing the need to document the benefits of public expenditures. Provisions relating to proprietary information and intellectual property are set forth in the CRADA. A Non-Disclosure agreement (NDA), if required, can be put into place during development of the project to facilitate discussions while protecting the company's proprietary information.</p>
<p>To the extent possible, it is preferred that proprietary information NOT be included in the application. If company proprietary information is included in the application, the specific information should be marked as such, and UT-Battelle/ORNL will treat that information as business confidential.</p>
<p><strong>CRADA Information<br /></strong><br />Awardees are expected to enter into a CRADA with UT-Battelle. Because of the need for accelerated placement and execution of the projects, the most favorable terms allowable within DOE guidelines have been established and will not be subject to negotiation. Failure to enter into a CRADA in a timely manner will result in termination of further project consideration. CRADAs have provisions that address the protection of the participants' existing proprietary information and intellectual property, as well as the information and intellectual property generated and made during the collaboration. More specifically, each party owns its own inventions while jointly made inventions will be jointly owned. In all cases, the U.S. Government will retain government use rights. Proprietary data used in performing the work may be protected for a period of five years.</p>
<p><strong>Financial Information<br /></strong><br />DOE is providing funding through the ORNL Sustainable Transportation Program and will support ORNL staff and equipment costs for a period of up to approximately 40 hours per project. Participating companies are responsible for a minimum of 50% cost share, which can be funds-in to ORNL or in-kind contributions (e.g., facilities, services, and staff time).  Company cost share cannot be met using funds from U.S. Government sources.</p>

</div>
<p class="MsoNormal">The United States (U.S.) Department of Homeland Security (DHS) National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD) Office of Cybersecurity and Communications (CS&amp;C) issues this initial RFI, in a planned series of RFIs, to collect information for planning purposes only regarding the concept of an Enterprise Automated Security Environment (EASE).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">EASE is a concept; it is not an entity, system, or program. The EASE concept envisions an environment in which automated and dynamic enterprise-level cyberspace<sup>1</sup> defense capabilities&mdash;such as adaptive sensing, sense-making, decision-making, and acting&mdash;provide shared situational awareness and support response in cyber-relevant time<sup>2 </sup>.&nbsp; EASE itself is not a capability, but the concept aims to enable the government to improve its own cyberspace defense capabilities, benefiting from the enhanced interoperability and automation that EASE should create. In addition, other enterprises may voluntarily leverage this concept to augment their own cyberspace defense capabilities.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Making the EASE concept a reality will require the concerted, collaborative efforts of government, private sector, industry, academia, and other stakeholders, such as critical infrastructure<sup>3</sup> and key resources (CIKR) end users. This RFI represents just the first step in this direction.</p>

<p><br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">USAID DR Deputy Health Office Chief<br /></span>STATEMENT OF WORK/ How to apply<br /><br /></strong>I. Introduction<br />USAID/Dominican Republic (DR) is seeking to fill the position of Deputy Health Office Chief to provide technical and supervisory leadership to the health team comprised of 1 US Direct Hire, 1 Personal Services Contractor and 5 FSNs managing an annual portfolio of over $7 million in PEPFAR HIV/AIDS funding. The incumbent will be responsible for HIV/AIDS issues for the Mission and will report to and support the USAID Health Office Chief, a U.S. direct hire who will provide general supervision and oversight of the Health Program portfolio. The Deputy Health Office Chief will contribute to the establishment of overall program priorities and work assignments, development of strategies, program and project designs, and scopes of work, as well as provide technical guidance and support to CORs and AORs in project implementation. S/he will have wide latitude for the exercise of independent judgment and will have formal decision-making authority in broad program areas consistent with USAID policies, goals, and strategies. Under the direction and guidance of the Chief of the Health Office, s/he will interact with the highest level of the Dominican government and represent USAID and the US Government in official settings. <br /><br />II. Background<br />The Dominican Republic has transitioned to upper lower middle income country status which presents a variety of challenges in light of the paradigm shift from the traditional conceptualization of development support. The Mission strategy is focused on helping the Dominican Republic to Improve Citizen Security and on prevention and management of HIV/AIDS infections which is a key component of the strategy. The Health Team is in the process of revising traditional development approaches to better respond and support the shift in needs of a new upper middle income country which is facing the challenges of key and vulnerable populations existing in fragile states of poverty and outside of the safety net. Additionally as the conditions in the DR continue to improve, responsibility for management and sustainability of activities is shifting to the government and NGO counterparts. Within this context, USAID is also challenged with accomplishing its goals with declining budget support. <br />The PEPFAR program is based on a country team approach of U.S. government agencies which includes the Centers for Disease Control, the Department of Defense, the Peace Corps, and the Agency for International Development. The Deputy Health Office Director will be closely involved in planning, collaborating , and negotiating with these agencies to manage the overall activities under this joint program as defined by the overall yearly Country Operational Plan (COP).</p>
<p>Country Overview:<br />The HIV prevalence in the Dominican Republic is 0.8 percent in the general population (DHS 2013). The 2013 Spectrum model estimates approximately 43,700 persons living with HIV. Of persons newly diagnosed with HIV, approximately 50 percent of men and 35 percent of women have an AIDS defining condition [Ministry of Health (MOH), 2013]. As of January 2014, there were 25,232 (45.6 percent male, median age=41) persons receiving clinical follow-up in one of 77 treatment facilities, of which 18,539 (73.5 percent) were on anti-retroviral treatment (ART). Stigma, discrimination and gender-based violence (GBV) marginalize those affected and create barriers to their ability to access needed HIV prevention, care and treatment services.</p>
<p>The epidemic disproportionately affects specific Key Populations such as commercial sex workers (CSW), Men who Have Sex with Men (MSM), and Injecting Drug Users (DU). HIV seroprevalence among key populations (2012 Behavioral Surveillance Survey) is higher than in the general population. Other Targeted Vulnerable Groups such as residents of bateyes, mobile populations, at-risk youth, at-risk teenage girls and at-risk young women, and HIV pregnant women and their infants also have high infection rates (DHS 2013).</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the HIV epidemic, USAID has supported the Government of the Dominican Republic and local organizations to strengthen the HIV response. Historically, most of this support has been funneled through international institutions with a focus on service delivery rather than sustainability. The Dominican Republic has been able to scale-up HIV care and treatment services and slow the spread of HIV by rigorously implementing evidence-based prevention strategies like the 100% Condom Campaign targeting commercial sex workers. Meanwhile, many organizations have strengthened their institutional capacity; maturing from support groups to service delivery organizations. Leveraging this emerging local capacity reflects commitment to investing in local organizations in order to strengthen the comprehensive response to HIV and ensure sustainability.</p>
<p>The complex relationship between the Dominican Republic and Haiti is reflective of a history of highly uneven development. There are an estimated 1,000,000 Haitians, including documented and undocumented immigrants, many living in extreme poverty, throughout the Dominican Republic. Numerous Haitians migrate to the DR seeking jobs, health care and a better life. For example, a significant number of women travel from Haiti to give birth in public hospitals in the Dominican Republic, returning to Haiti after delivery. It has been estimated in hospitals supported by USAID that between 20-35% of the patients delivering are Haitian and at the border areas this number rises to upwards of 70%. Additionally HIV prevalence in Haiti is estimated to be twice as high as in the DR. There is also considerable movement between Haiti and the Dominican Republic, which is especially exacerbated by the porous border. The January 12, 2010 earthquake in Haiti and the temporary movement of a large number of Haitians into the Dominican Republic further demonstrated the strong connectivity of issues across the island and a need for partnership.</p>
<p>The Deputy Health Office Chief will be mainly responsible for HIV/AIDS issues for the Mission and will report to and support the USAID Health Office Chief, a U.S. direct hire who will provide general supervision and oversight to the Health team. The Deputy Health Office Chief will contribute to the establishment of overall program priorities and work assignments, development of strategies, program and project designs, and scopes of work, as well as provide technical guidance and support to CORs and AORs in project implementation. S/he will have wide latitude for the exercise of independent judgment and will have formal decision-making authority in broad program areas consistent with USAID policies, goals, and strategies. S/he will interact with the highest level of the Dominican government and represent USAID and the US Government in official settings. S/he must be able to think and operate strategically and programmatically, analyzing complex situations in order to assist in the development of USAID strategic plans and programs, and assessing the impact of host country policies and practices on USAID programs. S/he will work in collaboration with members of the Health Team to achieve programmatic objectives. The incumbent will advise, collaborate and work with the health team in the planning, formulating, implementing, and monitoring and evaluating of health activities and strategies.<br /><br /><br />III.

<a href="mailto:claxton.t.fallen@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Savannah</a>
<DESC>There is a need for a modern pressurized hydrant fuel system to adequately support fueling and defueling operations for large frame aircraft assigned to Robins AFB, Georgia.  The existing failing hydrant system is unreliable.  The fuel pits and lateral control pits cannot be sealed properly, causing them to collect rain and ground water.  The infiltration of water has corroded the hydrant adapters, piping, pumps, motors, and caused damage to the electrical components that support the hydrant system.  Obsolescence, coupled with extensive deterioration of piping, pumps, and control systems, makes any repair alternative infeasible.   <br>       <br>   Work will include construct a pressurized hydrant fuel system with 16 hydrant outlets.  Modify a pumphouse to provide 151 liter-per-second (2,400 gallon-per-minute) pumping capacity fuel filter separators, upgraded electrical system and automatic controls, and emergency generator.  Construct hydrant loop piping system with leak detection, cathodic protection, and pigging system.  Work includes site preparation and improvements, pavement, drainage control, supporting utilities, and physical security measures.  Demolish or decommission the existing hydrant system outlets, lateral control pits, piping and supporting infrastructure.  Project includes remediation of fuel contaminated soils.   <br>

<DESC>Amendment 4: Adds two attachments (Questions and Answers MEUAS III and the Attendee List for Industry Day)
<p>This final amendment adds the Attendees List and responses to questions submitted after the 3 December 2014 Industry Day and one-on-one meetings for the Mid-Endurance Unmanned Aircraft System (MEUAS III). U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) appreciates the exceptional turnout and participation by Industry in this event. Several questions may not be fully answered until release of the draft Request for Proposal (RFP) and Performance Work Statement (PWS); however, the Q&amp;As have been answered to information currently available for release.</p>
<p>USSOCOM anticipates release of a Draft Solicitation Notice with the draft RFP and attachments (PWS, Notional CLINs, Capabilities Demonstration Document/Range Information, Incentive Suggestion, etc.) estimated to post by 17 February 2015. The draft will be released for 10 days for review and input, particularly a request for input on incentives by industry.</p>
<p>Due to the late release of the Q&amp;As and time to review responses from the Draft Solicitation, USSOCOM estimates the final solicitation to publish by 13 March for a period of 45 days. The award date has also shifted right with an estimated date of award of 15 November 2015. These dates are a best estimate and may be subject to change.</p>
<p>No further response will be accepted for the Industry Day posting; however, it will not be archived immediately as it may be sought for information purposes.</p>

<DESC>Questions and Answers
VA118-14-I-0419
February 2, 2015

1.	Question:  Can you confirm the name of the current contractor fulfilling this requirement? 

Answer:  SunGard Availability Services

2.	Question:  How long have they held the contract?  

Answer:  The current contract was awarded on April 1, 2014.  The period of performance is a six-month base period with four, six-month option periods.

3.	Question:  Was this a small business set aside previously? 

Answer:  No

4.	Question:  Is the amount for the previous award below the $4M range and could this contract be addressed through an 8(a) directed award?  

Answer:  Award notice was published to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website upon award.  Please see FBO.

5.	Question:  Can you confirm the allocated budget for this contract?  

Answer:  The Government cannot provide.  That information is procurement sensitive.  

6.	Question:  As this is a Total Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Set-Aside (SDVOSB), is there some reason why you are not utilizing the GSA VETS GWAC to issue this procurement? 

Answer:  While conducting Market Research, the Government determined that a SDVOSB set-aside on FBO was the best acquisition strategy.

7.	Question:  Request that VA consider the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 517911 (Telecommunication Resellers-Size Standard 1,500). This NAICS code would allow for the same services offered under 541513 and additional telecommunications services. 
Answer:  The Government is not changing the NAICS code for this procurement.  Based on the requirement, NAICS 541513 is more suitable for our requirement.  In addition, the market research conducted for this procurement utilized NAICS code 541513.
8.	Question:  Has the SEWP contract been considered as an option? 

Answer:  While conducting Market Research, the Government determined that a SDVOSB set-aside on FBO was the best acquisition strategy.

IAW FAR13.104, COs must promote competition to the maximum extent practicable to obtain supplies and services from the source whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government, considering the administrative cost of the purchase. When competition is not practicable, IAW FAR13.106-1(b), COs solicit from a single source for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.  COs may solicit from one source if the CO determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization). IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3),COs are required to include additional statements explaining the absence of competition (see 13.106-1 for brand name purchases) if only one source is solicited and the acquisition does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (does not apply to an acquisition of utility services available from only one source) or supporting the award decision if other than price-related factors were considered in selecting the supplier.  This template when completed can be used to document single source awards IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3).  Note: Statements such as "only known source" or "only source which can meet the required delivery date" are inadequate to support a sole source purchase.  
1. PURCHASE REQUEST OR REQUISITION NUMBER:
506-15-2-050-0046	1A. PROJECT/TASK NUMBER
	1B. ESTIMATED AMOUNT: 
$70,571.00
2. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED AND THE INTENDED USE:

Firm fixed price purchase order for the annual subscription renewal of UpToDate Clinical Information  database used by clinicians in all VISN 11 facilities.  Subscription period runs from February 1, 2015 - January 31, 2016.  
3. UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED:
UpToDate (UTD) is an evidence-based, physician-authored clinical decision support resource which clinicians trust to      make the right point-of-care decisions. UpToDate enables providers to access current peer-reviewed guidelines and to base patient treatment on established standards of practice. The information provided by UpToDate is web-based and available on a 24/7 basis.
UTD is solely owned by Wolters Kluwer Health, a leading global provider of information and is the sole proprietor and copyright holder of UTD content.  UTD cannot be accessed without a license obtained directly from Wolters Kluwer.  UTD does not utilize third party distributors/vendors and any claims by a third party to provide access to UTD content would be false.  
UTD has multiple purchase orders to provide content to every VAMC and VISN network nationwide.  


4.  REASON THAT SUGGESTED SOURCE IS THE ONLY SOURCE, WHICH CAN PROVIDE THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES:  
Wolters Kluwer Health is the sole proprietor of and holds the copyright to UpToDate content.  All content in UTD is original, copyrighted information and based on comprehensive synthesis of the available medical evidence.  This is for a software program renewal and therefore the services can only be performed by the original manufacturer.  UpToDate has multiple purchase orders to provide content to every single VAMC & VISN network nationwide. As a whole, the VA uses UTD extensively in the course of providing care to veterans. UpToDate cannot be accessed without a license obtained directly from Wolters  Kluwer.  UpToDate does not utilize 3rd party distributors/vendors.

5. DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND RESULTS OR STATEMENT WHY IT WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
No market research conducted.  As described above, Wolters Kluwer Health, is the sole proprietor and copyright holder of UpToDate content.  UTD content is unique and original and not available through any other resource.

6. Contracting Officer's Certification: Purchase is approved in accordance with FAR13.106-1(b). I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
