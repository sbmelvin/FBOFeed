<DESC>This is a presolicitation notice for commercial supplies as prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 5.207, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.
<p>The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. There is only one responsible source and no other suppliers or services will satisfy the agency requirements, under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).<br /><br />All responsible sources may identify their interest and submit a capability statement or proposal which shall be considered by the agency, except foreign participation is not permitted. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and does not constitute a solicitation.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>The U.S. Air Force has established a requirement for the solicitation and procurement of just in time delivery of aerospace coatings, sealants and technical assistance and support to 309 Aircraft Maintenance Group (AMXG) at Hill Air Force Base (AFB), Utah. The 309 AMXG supports the A-10, F-16, and C-130 airframes.</p>
<p>This presoliciation notice for Other than Full and Open Competition under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 is justified based on Government market research. Market research revealed there is only one vendor authorized by all five manufacturers of the required military specification coatings and sealants to provide just-in-time delivery to Hill AFB.</p>
<p>The Government intends to award this requirement as a noncompetitive contract action to Automotive Industrial Supply, 2507 South 1900 West, Ogden, UT 84401, United States (CAGE: 1FVZ3). This will be accomplished via a sole source contract.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that a solicitation will be issued on or about December 22, 2015 and contract award will occur on approximately March 2016. The estimated period of performance is projected to be 12 months from contract award date.</p>
<p>Delivery will be to 5894 A Lane, Building 220, Hill Air Force Base, Utah 84056.</p>
<p>Respondents are requested to specify whether they are large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a) concern, women-owned SB, Hubzone SB, Veteran-owned SB, or Service-disabled veteran- owned SB, and whether U.S. or foreign-owned firm.</p>
<p>Be advised that periodic access to the websites listed above is essential for obtaining updated documentation and the latest information regarding the procurement.</p>
<p>Questions and comments should be emailed to points of contact indicated on this presolicitation notice.</p>

<RESPDATE>012216
<ARCHDATE>02062016
<CONTACT>Welch, Sarah
<DESC>Replace second story deck on Swissmont hotel building in Stehekin WA.  
This pre-solicitation notice announces a future solicitation and contract for replacing the second story deck on the Swissmont, North Cascades NPS Complex, Stehekin, WA.  The electronic Request for Quotations (RFQ) will be available on approximately December 15, 2015, at www.FBO.gov.  
PROJECT DESCRIPTION:  The hotel was constructed in 1958 as a single-story structure; a full second level and an upper story deck on the lake-facing (south) side were added in 1968.  The building has gone through various remodels since 1968, with the addition of decks for the lower units in the early 1990s as well as remodeling of the staircase on the south side of the building.  This project includes the demolition and replacement of the second floor deck, including steel pipe and tube railing systems, and construction of a new shed roof over a portion of the west elevation.  There will be an option to construct privacy dividers.  The total (existing and reconstructed) deck is approximately 72 long, with six rooms opening onto it.  
Additional details will be provided in the Statement of Work and drawings posted with the Request for Quotations.  The contractor will have 75 calendar days to complete the construction after the Notice to Proceed is issued.  Construction must be completed by April 29, 2016.
PROJECT LOCATION:  The Swissmont is in Stehekin, WA, in Lake Chelan National Recreation Area.  Stehekin is a remote community located 50 miles from Chelan, Washington, at the north end of Lake Chelan. The Stehekin Valley is isolated; the roads do not connect with any highway system.  Stehekin is accessible from Chelan only by boat, barge, or float airplane.  The Swissmont is approximately 200 from the ferry landing, adjacent to a road suitable for hauling heavy equipment.  
Contractors are advised that barges run infrequently and, if needed, it is recommended that Contractors verify scheduled runs and costs, or cost of charter runs, with the barge companies before submitting a quote.  Some tools and materials may be sent on the passenger ferry runs, however restrictions apply.  Please contact the ferry and barge companies for more detailed information.
Lodging and meal services in Stehekin will be limited during the period of performance.   Maps, description, accommodations, and services may be viewed at http://www.nps.gov/noca/planyourvisit/stehekin.htm, www.lodgeatstehekin.com, www.stehekinvalley.com, and www.stehekin.com. 
SITE VISIT: A site visit will be held in early January, 2016, on a Monday, Wednesday, or Friday at 12:30 pm;  the exact date will be provided in the RFQ.  Contractors will be required to secure their own transportation to and from Stehekin.  There is regular boat service available from Lake Chelan Boat Company (schedules and rates are at www.ladyofthelake.com).  Attendance at the site visit is strongly encouraged so that prospective quoters gain a good understanding of the logistical challenges of this site.
DETAILS:  This is a best value procurement set-aside for small business concerns in accordance with FAR Part 19.5.

<p>This is a Pre-Solicitation/Notice of Intent Synopsis for a Sole Source noncompetitive award to Moog Corporation for the acquisition of new production units and to upgrade existing OE-273A(V)/URN Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN) antennae.

Only One Responsible Source and No Other Suppliers Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The Government intends to procure new production units and to upgrade existing units down to the Shop Replace Assembly (SRA) of the OE-273A(V)/URN Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN) antenna. The FY16-20 contract will include a basic FY16 requirement planned for award in September 2016 and may procure total quantities up to 9 new production units.

Additional information about potential OCI issues is provided in a link that can be found at FedBizOpps website located at <a href="http://www.fbo.gov/">http://</a><a href="http://www.fbo.gov/">www.fbo.gov</a></p>

<DESC>Synopsis:
<p>The Army Contracting Command - Redstone, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama 35898 on behalf of the Precision Fires Rocket and Missile Systems (PFRMS) Project Office, Program Executive Office Missiles and Space, hereby issues the following Sources Sought/Request for Information (RFI) to ascertain the level of interest of potential vendors desiring to contract for production of the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) Guided Missile and Launching Assembly (GMLA) Service Life Extension Program (SLEP). This amends the previous RFI concerning the ATACMS GMLA SLEP, issued on 22 April 2015.<br />THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY - This RFI is released pursuant to FAR 15.201(e). It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Respondees are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested parties' expense. In the past, this requirement has been restricted to Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control (LMMFC), Dallas, TX CAGE 64059 under the basis of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition 10.U.S.C 2304(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1 "Only One Responsible Source and No other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirement" since LMMFC has been the only known source that has the unique test equipment required to test ATACMS GMLAs and the expertise necessary to perform required maintenance and repair services. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. All offerors must meet prequalification requirements in order to be eligible for award.</p>
<p>Requirement Statement:</p>
<p>The Government seeks white papers regarding the capabilities, past similar experience and technical approach to this production effort and industry's assessment/opinion of the most efficient and cost effective method of executing this effort. The response should include: (1) a description of manufacturing capabilities that supports a SLEP for the ATACMS GMLA, (2) evidence of past similar experience and how it supports the SLEP, (3) an attached tier one schedule (Microsoft Project) showing the timing of events from contract award to delivery of the first ATACMS GMLA to the U.S. Government, and (4) a recommended facility and supply chain partners with available capacity for this SLEP effort beginning in Year 1. Industry is also encouraged to describe the benefits or risks associated with inclusion of production options and recommendations on contracting approaches that provide a best value to the Government while minimizing risk (especially cost risk) to the selected contractor. <br />The maximum quantity projections for the ATACMS Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) production:</p>
<p>Year 1 - QTY 200<br />Year 2 - QTY 200<br />Year 3 - QTY 200<br />Year 4 - QTY 200<br />Year 5 - QTY 200</p>
<p>Additional supporting efforts will include spares, obsolescence, modifications, and integrated logistics support.</p>
<p>RFI Purpose and Limitations:</p>
<p>The Government's intent is to better understand the current, state-of-the-art capabilities and strategies to determine the best solution. Industry feedback is vitally important and the Government will be receptive to any and all ideas. Proprietary information is neither solicited nor prohibited; however, if submitted, it should be appropriately marked. Please limit formal white paper submissions to no more than 20 pages, to include cover letter. In addition five attachments consisting of briefing slides, pre-printed commercial brochures or sales literature may be included. Electronic submissions are strongly encouraged. All items must be in Microsoft Office 2003 (or later) format or Adobe PDF format and should be free of all computer viruses.</p>
<p>The information provided may be used by the Army in developing its acquisition strategy and in its Statement of Work/Statement of Objectives or Performance Specifications. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. It is the responsibility of any potential offeror to monitor FedBizOpps for additional information pertaining to this requirement. Multiple awards may be pursued depending on industry response.</p>
<p>All questions and industry responses shall be submitted via email to Army Contracting Command-Redstone, Christy Reed, Contract Specialist, email address: christy.l.reed.civ@mail.mil. Responses must be received no later than 22 December 2015 and be in compliance with all applicable Army, DoD and Federal policies. All material submitted in response to this RFI must be unclassified and properly marked. Submissions will not be returned.<br /><br />Contracting Office Address:<br />Department of the Army, Army Contracting Command - Redstone; Attention: CCAM-TMB, Christy Reed, BLDG 5303 (3rd Floor); Martin Road, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama 35898-5000.</p>

<p>RFI - Emergency Support Function (ESF) #6 Support Services (ESS) Page 1 of 3</p>
<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY <br />This is a Source Sought Notice.</p>
<p>The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to seek industry input regarding the provision for the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Emergency Support Function (ESF) 6 Support Services.</p>
<p>Under the National Response Framework, Emergency Support Function (ESF) #6, FEMA is responsible for coordinating and providing Mass Care, Emergency Assistance, Temporary Housing, and Human Services programs, services, and support to State and local government. ESF #6 mission areas include congregate and non-congregate sheltering, feeding, distribution of emergency supplies, and reunification services; support for children, people with disabilities and others with access and functional needs, mass evacuation, household pets and service animals; voluntary agency coordination and donations management; direct housing and financial assistance; and human services programs, as defined in the Stafford Act, as well as under the Economy Act. FEMA may deploy staff, equipment, materials, and supplies to augment State capabilities. It is FEMA's intent to enhance private sector engagement to bolster the nation's whole community preparedness, response, and recovery capabilities.</p>
<p>When states receive a Presidential declaration of emergency or major disaster, they may request assistance from FEMA to provide life-sustaining mass care/emergency assistance to the affected population. In the aftermath of a large-scale disaster or catastrophic event, there will be an immediate need to provide critical life-sustaining assistance such as shelter, food and other mass care and emergency assistance services to disaster survivors. FEMA coordinates the overall ESF #6 response and may deploy staff, equipment, materials, and supplies to augment state capabilities.</p>
<p>FEMA aligns ESF #6 under the Individual Assistance Division, whose mission is "to ensure that disaster survivors have timely access to a full range of programs and services to maximize their recovery, through coordination among local, Federal, State, Tribal governments, voluntary agencies, and the Private Sector".</p>
<p>FEMA must have a reliable source to provide timely support to Federal mass care/emergency assistance operations under the following service categories: <br />1. Steady-State Support <br />2. Operational Planning Support <br />3. Staffing Support <br />4. Mass Care Assistance</p>

<DESC>Background
DOI Organization 
The U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) is a Cabinet-level agency that manages America's vast natural and cultural resources. The DOI employs approximately 70,000 people, including expert scientists and resource-management professionals, in nine technical bureaus:
-	Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA)
-	Bureau of Land Management (BLM)
-	Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM)
-	Bureau of Reclamation (BOR)
-	Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE)
-	National Park Service (NPS)
-	Office of Surface Mining, Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM)
-	U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS)
-	U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)
-	Other Interior Offices

As part of the IT Transformation, the Department is focused on an enterprise IT services model that will enable a unified strategy across the Department and leverage greater scale to drive more efficient operations.

DOI Operating Environment
Service locations and end-points
DOI employees are located in 1,873 offices in all 50 States, the District of Columbia, and US Territories.  Approximately 80% of DOI employees work in locations with fewer than 25 total employees.

Many DOI employees and contractors regularly telework, travel or work for extended periods of time from remote field locations. Additionally, many DOI systems may need to be available to stakeholders in other government agencies and outside of the government domain.

The DOI Bureaus and Offices currently deliver data and services from more than 400 locations. Over 30% of these locations and over 65% of DOI servers are located within one (1) hour driving distance of eight metropolitan areas.

Scope 

This Request for Information (RFI) pertains to Department of the Interior (DOI) requirements for on premises Commercial Data Center Colocation and Hosting Services within the United States of America. 

Purpose 
The purpose of this RFI is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from sources that can provide data center consolidation and hosting services in the United States of America to facilitate the DOIs Data Center Consolidation Initiative.  This project directly supports the larger Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative (FDCCI).

The DOI is in the process of examining options for consolidating its many isolated and independent data centers into a single or reduced number of locations.   For all public cloud related services, DOI envisions the continued use of its DOI Foundation Cloud Hosting Services (FCHS) Contract, which has made significant progress since its award in 2013.  The full details regarding the contract can be found at the following site - cloud.doi.gov.  Hence, the scope of work requested in this request is limited to co-location and its affiliated hosting and migration services. 

The DOI will use information from this RFI to assess viable and innovative consolidation approaches, and the availability of state-of-the-art data center hosting services. A favorable market survey will be followed by the development and execution of a supporting acquisition strategy.  The specific timeframe for execution will be developed once quality responses to this RFI and viability of market offerings in this area are confirmed.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT notice.
<p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Detroit District, is seeking potential firms that have the capability to provide construction services for installation of electrical and mechanical equipment to electrically operate and remotely control the Lake Superior Regulatory Structure, hereinafter referred to as the Compensating Works.</p>
<p>The location of the project is the U.S. owned section of the Compensating Works located at the head of the St Mary's River rapids between the cities of Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan and Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. The driving factor behind remotely controlling the gates is to decrease the rate of water level change and optimize water velocity in the downstream rapids for purposes of increased fish spawning and habitat creation.</p>
<p>The Scope of Work (SOW) will include electrical operation and remote controls as defined below:</p>
<p>- Electrical Operation (Locally Controlled System): Augment the manual hand crank operation with the installation of electrical actuators to operate the Compensating Works eight (8) sluice gates using electric-powered motors, in addition to actuator manual operation.</p>
<p>- Remote Controls (Remotely Controlled System): Install a PLC based, centrally located and remotely controlled gate Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system such that gate movement is manually entered for any or all gates with gates adjusting at selected rates and sequence of gate movements.</p>
<p>Work will include but not be limited to construction and installation of the following: roughly 3,500 lf of high voltage (4160-volts) power ran through a duct bank along the north dike connecting the Compensating Works to the Powerhouse, new 4160/480 transformer, new climate controlled electrical building (estimated 200 sq ft) to house equipment and SCADA display, 24-strand fiber runs connecting system to multiple buildings on the site, installation of electrical actuators,  security camera and alarm system upstream and downstream of the Compensating Works integrated into the SCADA system, installation of gate height measurement equipment, installation of a flow rate measurement system, removal and disposal of existing power cables, actuators and associated equipment.</p>
<p>This project is logistically challenging and it's anticipated that marine installation activities will be required.  A barge can be moored to the upstream end of the peninsula on which the Compensating Works is located for delivery of materials or alternate methods of delivery by the contractor may be considered.</p>
<p>The contract will start on 1 September 2016 and is required to be completed on 15 November 2017.</p>
<p>Contract award is estimated in early August 2016.</p>
<p>The estimated cost of construction is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.</p>
<p>The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 238210, which has a size standard of $15,000,000 in average annual receipts.</p>
<p>This is NOT a request for proposal. This announcement is for planning purposes only. Qualified companies are encouraged to respond. The response to this notice shall be in summary format and shall not exceed eight (8) pages, including the attached response form. In order to determine the extent of industry interest and experience in the project, interested contractors shall present the following information:</p>

The locks assist ships navigating the 21 foot drop from Lake Superior to the St. Marys River.  There are two operating locks at the Soo, the MacArthur Lock and the Poe Lock. The West Center Pier forms the north side of the approach channel to both the Poe and MacArthur Locks and is frequently used as a mooring area for vessels waiting their turn to pass through the locks and for vessels idled when fog closes the river to navigation.</p>
<p>The repair effort includes trenching out an approximate 2 foot depth of channel bottom bedrock foundation to allow for installation of approximately 350 lineal feet of anchored steel sheet pile wall adjacent to the approach wall. Grout will be installed between the existing approach wall and the required sheet pile wall in a fashion that will allow all voids in the bedrock foundation to be filled. The sheet pile wall shall be anchored to the existing concrete monolith structure on the approach wall by mechanical and/or epoxy anchorages. A total of 5 bollard structures including reinforced concrete foundations shall be reconstructed along the surface of the structure. The Contractor shall also construct a concrete overlay over the existing concrete monolith structure to restore the deteriorated surface. There are several utilities in the area of construction that will need to be protected and not disturbed during construction. Due to load restrictions near the structure, loading will be limited to the areas designated in the plans and specifications during construction. Vehicles and machinery must access the work zone from the adjacent marine environment due to limited accessibility from land. It is imperative that the construction activities associated with this project do not disturb or negatively impact the commercial navigation industry that utilizes the Soo Lock facility.</p>
<p><br />The contract will start on 1 August 2016 and is required to be completed on 15 November 2017.</p>
<p>The estimated award date of the contract is 1 August 2016.</p>
<p>The estimated cost of construction is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.</p>
<p>The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 237990, which has a size standard of $36,500,000 in average annual receipts.</p>
<p>This is NOT a request for proposal. This announcement is for planning purposes only. Qualified companies are encouraged to respond. The response to this notice shall be in summary format and shall not exceed eight (8) pages, including the attached response form. In order to determine the extent of industry interest and experience in the project, interested contractors shall present the following information:</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. This announcement constitutes a Source Sought Synopsis. This is not a Request for Proposal.
<p>Small Business Community to include: Small Business, Section 8(a), Historically Underutilized Business Zones (HUB-Zone), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), and Women Owned Small Business (WOSB). The Government must ensure there is adequate competition among the potential pool of responsible contractors and will be used to identify firms for the purpose of determining how the solicitation will be advertised. This sources sought announcement is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, implied or otherwise, to issue a solicitation or award a contract.</p>
<p>Project One - Kissimmee River Restoration, C38, Reach 2 Backfill</p>
<p>The scope of work for this project involves channel backfill and the removal of water control structure S-65C. Portions of the C-38 within Reach 2 of the Kissimmee River Basin will be backfilled. The material used for the backfill will be sourced from existing dredge disposal mounds located along the adjacent C-38 canal banks. The canal will be backfilled starting approximately 1,900 LF north of the US HWY 98 bridge crossing, continuing north for approximately 34,400 LF. During the backfilling operations, the S-65C spillway, lock tenders residence, and lock structures will be demolished. The S-65C tieback levees will also be degraded and the S-65CX structure on the historic Kissimmee River will be removed. Work includes turbidity monitoring and landscaping. Overall site preparation includes installation of the erosion control protection measures, turbidity barriers and the access/haul roads, clearing and grubbing of the dredge disposal mounds, and aquatic and upland vegetation to provide erosion protection.</p>
<p>Project Two - Kissimmee River Restoration, S-69 Weir</p>
<p>The S-69 Weir serves as the downstream terminus of the C-38 backfill maximizing the amount of wetlands re-hydrated, helping to maintain the authorized federal navigation on the Kissimmee River, removing the need for a new lock structure on the restored river, and preventing the head cutting of the restored sections of C-38. The system will dissipate the energy of flood flows transitioning from the restored Kissimmee River floodplain to the remnant C-38 channel. The project includes complete backfilling of approximately 2,600 feet of the C-38 Canal from just downstream of the weir north to the historic river channel crossing. The inverted u-shaped weir being constructed at the terminus of the C-38 backfill will be 2,560 linear feet, with a crest elevation of 29.8 feet NAVD88 (31 feet NGVD29). The weir crest width is approximately 1 foot. Access will be provided by utilizing the backfill and overbank areas downstream of the weir to construct an access road. The access road will also function as apron/energy dissipation feature/armoring for the weir. The restored river channel will function as the main conduit for flow during the construction period.</p>
<p>Firm's response to this Synopsis shall be limited to 5 pages and shall include the following information: 1. Firm's name, address, point of contact, phone number, and e-mail address; 2. Firm's interest in bidding on each solicitation when issued; 3. Firm's capability to perform a contract of this magnitude and complexity of comparable work performed within the past 5 years; 4. Brief description of the project, customer name, timeliness of performance, customer satisfaction, and dollar value of the project - provide at least 3 examples; 5. Firm's small business category and Business Size (Small Business, HUB-Zone, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, or 8(a)); 6. Firm's Joint Venture information if applicable - existing; 7. Firm's bonding capabilities.</p>
<p>Please provide a Statement of Capability (SOC) stating your skills, experience, and knowledge required to perform the specified types of work to James Randall at James.E.Randall@usace.army.mil no later than 22 December 2015. This SOC should be a brief description of your company's capabilities. Contractors should provide brief references of jobs they have performed that are similar. If we do not receive an adequate number of qualified respondents (i.e., two or more responsible firms), the solicitation shall be issued on an unrestricted basis and all firms regardless of size shall be eligible and encouraged to compete for this project.</p>
<p>REMEMBER: DO NOT REGISTER AS A PLAN HOLDER AT THIS TIME. THE FINAL PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS WILL CARRY A DIFFERENT SOLICITATION NUMBER.</p>

Any such treatment would be an adjunct to the outpatient SA treatment being provided by GJVHCS and must be approved in advance by ADS staff.
4.	The availability of attending religious services of the Veteran's choosing would enhance the desirability of entering into a contract with the facility. However, in no case will participation in religious services be required of any Veteran.
5.	The availability of facility staff to meet with the Veteran and GJVHCS ADS staff at the VA to coordinate housing needs and treatment activities will enhance the desirability of entering into a contract with the facility.
6.	The availability of services to assist Veterans with individual needs upon leaving the facility will enhance the desirability of entering into a contract with the facility. These needs may include but are not limited to: finding permanent housing, finding employment, providing ongoing support for recovery, and connecting with other resources in the community.

<DESC>Sole Source Intent. The United States Army Mission and Installation Contracting Command (MICC) Yuma, U.S. Army Yuma Proving Ground (USAYPG), Arizona, intends to negotiate a firm-fixed price contract on a sole source basis with: Morale Welfare and Recreation (MWR) Bldg. 301 C Street, Yuma, AZ 85365. It is anticipated that a Firm Fixed Price contract will be awarded on a sole source basis to the MWR located at USAYPG bowling center is 6 lanes and is a part time contract. Currently, the certified technician is an MWR employee who splits time between half day for lanes maintenance and half day bowling alley food service. DPW paid to send this technician to training to obtain the certification required. It is in the best interest of the Government to keep this contract in house with MWR. Cost would be overinflated based on former research to bring in outside company to this remote location (26 miles from Yuma) to maintain six lanes part time and to respond to after contract hours repairs. The distance, combined with the relatively low maintenance volume involved (only 6 lanes), makes it impracticable to expect cost effective and timely services from another source. Lack of timely maintenance and repair would lead to operational failures and increased costs due to improper care and maintenance of the bowling equipment. If the equipment breaks down, the bowling center will no longer be able to be utilized by the soldiers and civilians residing on or visiting the base. At a remote location like USAYPG, this would be extremely detrimental to the morale and welfare of the base.<br />

<SOLNBR>CP-12-07-15-01
<RESPDATE>122115
<ARCHDATE>12222015
<CONTACT>Michael R. Jurkowski, Phone 7036032117, Email mjurkowski@abilityone.gov
<DESC>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the procurement of products or services.  This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell office, janitorial, and other products to the offices included at the Texas National Guard, Camp Mabry, TX (Camp Mabry). <br /> <br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (now operating as the U.S. AbilityOne Commission) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) the Committee is required to complete an impact analysis related to the potential addition of a Base Supply Center at Camp Mabry.</p>
<p>National Industries for the Blind (NIB), an AbilityOne Program designated central nonprofit agency (CNA), is currently in discussions with officials at Camp Mabry to establish a Base Supply Center (BSC).  BSCs are retail stores on military installations and in Federal office buildings that sell a wide range of office, janitorial, and other products primarily to meet the same-day shopping needs of Government customers.</p>
<p>The Commission approves the addition of BSCs to its PL primarily as outlets for the sale of AbilityOne products.  The sale of AbilityOne products to Government customers is one of the ways that the Commission accomplishes its mission of creating employment opportunities for people who are blind or who have other severe disabilities.  The Commission also allows the sale of a wide variety of non-AbilityOne products referred to as convenience items in the BSC to make each store a same day, one-stop shopping option for Government customers.  The Government purchase card (GPC) is the primary means of payment for products purchased in BSCs.   Use of the BSC by Camp Mabry customers is not mandatory.  It is simply another shopping option for your GPC holders.</p>
<p>Typically, BSCs carry a full range of office, janitorial, and sanitation supplies and almost any other product being legitimately sought for purchase by the GPC holder.</p>
<p>The addition of a BSC to the Commission's PL follows a deliberative process.  Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Section 51-2.4 requires that the Commission consider the level of impact on the total sales of commercial firms from whom Government purchasers are currently buying the same or similar products being proposed for sale in the BSC.  Although sales in the retail environment are not guaranteed to any firm, it is possible that the level of business being done with local small businesses in (BSC Site) area will be diverted to the BSC as GPC holders opt to shop at the on-installation BSC.  The kinds of firms that could be affected might include any businesses that sell office, janitorial, sanitation, and hardware supplies to GPC holders.</p>
<p>Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be authorized by the Committee to enter into a no-cost contract for operation of the BSC at Camp Mabry will be the Department of the Army, W7N2 USPFO ACTIVITY TX ARNG.</p>
<p>If your firm is currently selling office, janitorial, or other BSC-type products to offices at the Camp Mabry it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the office, janitorial, or BSC-type products to offices at Camp Mabry for the same most recent 12-month period.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to offices at Camp Mabry.</p>
<p>6.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>7.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>8.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response.  Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than December 21, 2015 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov.  If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this Notice or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits inquiries from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. NASA provides no funding in conjunction with these potential licenses. <p> THE TECHNOLOGY: Scientists at NASA Langley Research Center have developed a patented SansEC Sensor Technology for use in many different areas, including tall structures and wind turbines. The SansEC technology is a proven wireless sensing platform capable of measuring the electrical impedance of physical matter in proximity to the sensor based on a change in its resonance response. The SansEC sensor also exhibits a unique characteristic to disperse the lightning strike current to help mitigate lightning damage. When a lightning leader propagates through the atmosphere in the vicinity of a tall structure, the lightning electromagnetic emissions generated from the moving electrical charge will impinge upon the tall structure before the actual charge attaches. As the lightning leader propagates closer to the tall structure, the radiated emissions at the tall structure will grow stronger. The SansEC sensor is designed to operate within the lightning radiated emission spectrum and thus is passively powered by the external oscillating magnetic field from the lightning itself. The sensor will resonate and generate its own oscillating magnetic and electric fields, which have been demonstrated to influence lighting attachment and propagation. In a turbine blade application, an array of SansEC sensors will cover the surface area of the composite blade, providing both lightning mitigation and damage sensing. The research team at NASA Langley is available to assist with further development. NASA is seeking to license this technology commercially. <p> To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to <a href="mailto:LaRC-PatentLicensing@mail.nasa.gov">LaRC-PatentLicensing@mail.nasa.gov </a> with the title of this Technology Transfer Opportunity as listed in this FBO notice and your preferred contact information.  Please also provide the nature of your interest in the technology along with a brief background of your company. For more information about licensing other NASA-developed technologies, please visit the NASA Technology Transfer Portal at <A HREF="http://technology.nasa.gov/">http://technology.nasa.gov/ </A>  . <p> These responses are provided to members of NASA Langleys Office of Strategic Analysis and Business Development OSACB for the purpose of promoting public awareness of NASA-developed technology products, and conducting preliminary market research to determine public interest in and potential for future licensing opportunities. If direct licensing interest results from this posting, OSACB will follow the required formal licensing process of posting in the Federal Register.  No follow-on procurement is expected to result from responses to this Notice.

<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits inquiries from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use. NASA provides no funding in conjunction with these potential licenses. <p> THE TECHNOLOGY: Scientists at NASA Langley Research Center have developed a sensor technology for structural health monitoring on composite aircraft surfaces. When conventional aircraft are struck by lightning, the result can range from no damage to serious damage that requires extensive repairs that can take the airplane out of service for an extended period of time. The SansEC technology is a proven wireless sensing platform capable of measuring the electrical impedance of physical matter in proximity to the sensor based on a change in its resonance response. The sensor also exhibits a unique characteristic to disperse the lightning strike current to help mitigate lightning damage. When a lightning leader propagates through the atmosphere in the vicinity of an aircraft, the lightning electromagnetic emissions generated from the moving electrical charge will radiate the aircraft surface before the actual strike to the aircraft can occur. As the lightning leader propagates closer to the aircraft, the radiated emissions at the aircraft will grow stronger. By design, the frequency bandwidth of the lightning radiated is in the range for SansEC resonance. Hence the SansEC coil will be passively powered by the external oscillating magnetic field of the lightning radiated emission. The coil will resonate and generate its own oscillating magnetic and electric fields. These fields generate so-called Lorentz forces that influence the direction and momentum of the lightning attachment and thereby deflect/spread where the strike entry and exit points/damage occurs on the aircraft. In this application, an array of SansEC sensors will cover a selective area of the aircraft surface providing both mitigation and damage sensing.  NASA is seeking to license this technology commercially. <p> To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to <a href="mailto:LaRC-PatentLicensing@mail.nasa.gov">LaRC-PatentLicensing@mail.nasa.gov </a> with the title of this Technology Transfer Opportunity as listed in this FBO notice and your preferred contact information.

<DESC>Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, it is the Government's intent to award a sole source service contract to the ANDERHOLM HYDROLOGY LLC to provide water quality modeling for the Upper Middle Rio Grande Water Operations Model (URGWOM). THIS IS NOT A FORMAL SOLICITATION. This synopsis is not considered a Request for Quotation or Proposal. No solicitation document is available, and telephone requests for a copy of the solicitation will not be honored. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government. All responses received within 15 days will be considered. If no affirmative written response is received, the service contract will be awarded without further notice. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed service contract is based on the fact that ANDERHOLM HYDROLOGY LLC is the only firm capable and authorized to give the necessary support. The URGWOM Water Quality Technical Team requires very specific expertise in water quality modeling that supports the USACE objective. This expertise would include historical program and data experience in order to effectively assist the URGWOM Technical Team with its ongoing program mission and to meet the contract period of performance with little supervision and training. Award of this service contract will be based upon FAR 6.302-1(a)(2) "When the supplies or services required by the agency are available from only one responsible source...", as well as the possible responses to this notice, and is solely within the discretion of the Government. Detailed capabilities must be submitted to the following email address no later than 2:00 PM (MST) 22 December 2015: karen.k.irving@usace.army.mil.

<DESC>This is a notice for intent to sole source to the manufacturer of Radiology Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS), Philips Healthcare.
We believe that they are the only vendor capable of providing the required maintenance, support and ongoing sustainment services.
These services were previously competed on GSA and the open market and the only vendor to provide a response was Philips Healthcare.
A draft of the performance work statement is attached which lists the equipment that will need coverage.
If you believe that your company is capable of maintaining the equipment in the performance work statement, then please provide your information to angela.gerlitzki@va.gov by December 22, 2015.
Please note that small business contractors must comply with the limitations in subcontracting clause, which requires the prime contractor to perform at least 50 percent of the work. The Government will not make an award to a small business concern that intends to send all of the equipment to the manufacturer for repairs and is simply acting as a "pass through". Please demonstrate in the response your capabilities showing that your company is capable of providing at least 50% of the work.
Also Note that vendor must have FDA 510K certification to provide the medical system and ongoing software updates and upgrades.

ALL QUESTIONS RECEIVED AFTER THIS DATE AND TIME WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED. All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

<p>Contractors are sought to help fill the difficult gaps in the ER schedule. They are often put on the schedule for nights, weekends, holidays, and are often grouped into several shifts when needed during a short period of time. Sometimes, they are not scheduled for an extended period of time to ensure the other permanent doctors get enough shifts for their any -80- requirements. Sometimes, there is a need of several shifts to be filled within a short period of time. Even though not convenient, they frequently have to cover single shifts when needed. This can result in significant expense for those traveling a long distance, but cannot always be avoided. We aim to group shifts into at least two days in a row, but often that cannot be arranged.</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<DESC>Request for Information regarding environmental sample databases and the supporting front-end software for US EPA, Region 7, Laboratory, Kansas City, KS.

THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)/MARKET SURVEY SOURCES SOUGHT INQUIRY.  NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation, nor is it a request seeking offerors to be placed on a solicitation mailing list.  Response to this survey is voluntary and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this RFI/Market Survey or any follow-up information requests.  No solicitation document exists at this time, and calls requesting a solicitation will not be answered.

Background
The STC currently has a locally-developed Oracle database application that the Region 7 laboratory uses to manage environmental laboratory information.  The contents of the database include descriptions of the analytical service (matrix, method, analytes and reporting limits), customer request information (site, number of samples, locations), specific information about each sample and analysis (location, reference), and the results for each sample (matrix, method, analyte).  The four groups of users of this system are laboratory customers, laboratory analysts, laboratory data managers, and static data managers (maintain reference data).  The system begins when the customer begins planning the sampling event, continues with sample receipt, analysis, and reporting from the laboratory, and ends with the disposal of samples.  

About 200 forms and reports are needed as the front-end of this system.  Initial reports and forms provide the customer with sample planning information such as number of samples and analytical methods, along with field tags and field sheets for samples.  Various in-progress reports are used by chemists and managers to monitor schedules, receive annual summaries, view charges, view results, perform quality control measures, and document sample results. Additionally, all sample data is transmitted electronically from the instrument into the database.  Final reports to the customers depend on the needs of the project:  standard format, standard format with quality control results, single sample reports, and electronic data transfer into EPA databases.  Finally, sample disposal reports document and track whether samples are hazardous and are used as part of the waste disposal program in the laboratory.

The Oracle database has been updated to include SEDD.  SEDD is a set of agency and program neutral instructions for developing standardized electronic data deliverable (SEDD) formats for environmental analytical data.  The updated Oracle database design adds the capability to store information about sample receipt batches, sample preparation batches, and analytical batches, enabling the production of SEDD 2a, 2b, and 3 types of data deliverables.

Purpose and Objectives

U. S. EPA Region 7 Science and Technology Center (STC, laboratory) is looking for information about environmental sample databases and the supporting front-end software.  Region 7 is evaluating the next steps to upgrade the current LIMS system, and is interested in learning what possible solutions exist.  Region 7 manages sample receipt and analysis for two in-house laboratories and two external (contracted) environmental laboratories. 

Period of Performance:  Unknown at this time

Scenarios

1.	In general terms, describe the solution your company would recommend for for full replacement of the database and the front-end forms.
2.	In general terms, describe the solution your company would recommend for a front-end solution for the updated Oracle database.
3.	In general terms, describe the solution your company would recommend for a front-end solution for the Promium database (commercially available database).

All solutions need to be able to migrate historical data from the current Oracle database into the new solution, migrate analytical data from the analytical instruments into the new system, and provide a similar range of forms and reports.

Deliverables include the following:

1.	Company Name and DUNS
2.	Company point of contact name, email address and telephone number.
3.	Demonstration of capability
4.	Socioeconomic category
5.	Experience working with environmental laboratories
6.	Explain how the system would work in the laboratory setting
7.      Explain who would perform minor and major changes

Please do not include any cost information at this time.  Your company may provide information on as many Scenarios, as applicable to your qualifications (even if it is just for one Scenario).  Be sure to reference each specific Scenario your information is referring to.

For more details on this requirement, please go to:  www.fedconnect.net

All questions shall be sent through Fedconnect only.  All information pertaining to this RFI shall be submitted through Fedconnect only.  Questions/information received by other means than Fedconnect will not be accepted.  All questions must be submitted, no later than December 31, 2015.

All information must be submitted through Fedconnect, no later than January 7, 2016 at 12:00 pm Eastern Standard Time.

The contract will be awarded on a firm-fixed-price basis. To receive an award, the Contractor must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) www.sam.gov.<br />UNITED STATES COAST GUARD OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM<br />IT IS THE POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES COAST GUARD (USCG) TO ISSUE SOLICITATIONS AND MAKE CONTRACT AWARDS IN A FAIR AND TIMELY MANNER. THE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR AGENCY PROTESTS (OPAP) WAS ESTABLISHED TO INVESTIGATE AGENCY PROTEST ISSUES AND RESOLVE THEM WITHOUT EXPENSIVE AND TIME- CONSUMING LITIGATION. OPAP IS AN INDEPENDENT REVIEWING AUTHORITY THAT IS EMPOWERED TO GRANT A PREVAILING PROTESTER ESSENTIALLY THE SAME RELIEF AS THE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE (GAO).
<p>INTERESTED PARTIES ARE ENCOURAGED TO SEEK RESOLUTION OF THEIR CONCERNS WITHIN THE USCG AS AN ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION (ADR) FORUM RATHER THAN FILING A PROTEST WITH THE GAO OR SOME EXTERNAL FORUM. INTERESTED PARTIES MAY SEEK RESOLUTION OF THEIR CONCERNS INFORMALLY OR OPT TO FILE A FORMAL AGENCY PROTEST WITH THE CONTRACTING OFFICER OR OMBUDSMAN.</p>
<p>INFORMAL FORUM WITH THE OMBUDSMAN. INTERESTED PARTIES WHO BELIEVE A SPECIFIC USCG PROCUREMENT IS UNFAIR OR OTHERWISE DEFECTIVE SHOULD FIRST DIRECT THEIR CONCERNS TO THE APPLICABLE CONTRACTING OFFICER. IF THE CONTRACTING OFFICER IS UNABLE TO SATISFY THEIR CONCERNS, INTERESTED PARTIES ARE ENCOURAGED TO CONTACT THE U.S. COAST GUARD OMBUDSMAN FOR AGENCY PROTESTS. UNDER THIS INFORMAL PROCESS THE AGENCY IS NOT REQUIRED TO SUSPEND CONTRACT AWARD PERFORMANCE. USE OF AN INFORMAL FORUM DOES NOT SUSPEND ANY TIME REQUIREMENT FOR FILING A PROTEST WITH THE AGENCY OR OTHER FORUM. IN ORDER TO ENSURE A TIMELY RESPONSE, INTERESTED PARTIES SHOULD PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION TO THE OMBUDSMAN: SOLICITATION/CONTRACT NUMBER, CONTRACTING OFFICE, CONTRACTING OFFICER, AND SOLICITATION CLOSING DATE (IF APPLICABLE).</p>
<p>FORMAL AGENCY PROTEST WITH THE OMBUDSMAN. PRIOR TO SUBMITTING A FORMAL AGENCY PROTEST, PROTESTERS MUST FIRST USE THEIR BEST EFFORTS TO RESOLVE THEIR CONCERNS WITH THE CONTRACTING OFFICER THROUGH OPEN AND FRANK DISCUSSIONS. IF THE PROTESTER'S CONCERNS ARE UNRESOLVED, AN INDEPENDENT REVIEW IS AVAILABLE BY THE OMBUDSMAN. THE PROTESTER MAY FILE A FORMAL AGENCY PROTEST TO EITHER THE CONTRACTING OFFICER OR AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THAT, THE OMBUDSMAN UNDER THE OPAP PROGRAM. CONTRACT AWARD OR PERFORMANCE WILL BE SUSPENDED DURING THE PROTEST PERIOD UNLESS CONTRACT AWARD OR PERFORMANCE IS JUSTIFIED, IN WRITING, FOR URGENT AND COMPELLING REASONS OR IS DETERMINED IN WRITING TO BE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE GOVERNMENT. THE AGENCY'S GOAL IS TO RESOLVE PROTESTS IN LESS THAN 35 CALENDAR DAYS FROM THE DATE OF FILING. PROTESTS SHALL INCLUDE THE INFORMATION SET FORTH IN FAR 33.103(D) (2). IF THE PROTESTER FAILS TO SUBMIT THE REQUIRED INFORMATION, RESOLUTION OF THE PROTEST MAY BE DELAYED OR THE PROTEST MAY BE DISMISSED. TO BE TIMELY PROTESTS MUST BE FILED WITHIN THE PERIOD SPECIFIED IN FAR 33.103(E). FORMAL PROTESTS FILED UNDER THE OPAP PROGRAM SHOULD BE SUBMITTED ELECTRONICALLY TO OPAP@USCG.MIL AND THE CONTRACTING OFFICER OR BY HAND DELIVERY TO THE CONTRACTING OFFICER.</p>
<p>ELECTION OF FORUM. AFTER AN INTERESTED PARTY PROTESTS A COAST GUARD PROCUREMENT TO THE CONTRACTING OFFICER OR THE OMBUDSMAN, AND WHILE THE PROTEST IS PENDING, THE PROTESTER AGREES NOT TO FILE A PROTEST WITH THE GAO OR OTHER EXTERNAL FORUM. IF THE PROTEST IS FILED WITH AN EXTERNAL FORUM, THE AGENCY PROTEST WILL BE DISMISSED.</p>

<DESC>RFQ has been extended to 14 December 2015.
<p>Clarifications and drawings have been added.</p>
<p>1) The only laminated shim on NAWC Drawing 525879, Rev None (attached) is P/N 525879-1. The remaining dash numbers (-2 thru -6) are solid shim. The thicknesses range from .063 to .250 inches.</p>
<p>2) Only the -1 is made from laminated brass stock. The -2 thru -5 are made from solid brass stock (Material spec: UNS26000, H02). The -6 is made from solid stainless steel stock (Material spec: 316L per ASTM A240, annealed).</p>
<p>3) For the -1 only: The specification called out on the drawing for the laminated brass shim stock (P/N 525879-1) is AMS-DTL-22499/2, TYPE I, CLASS II. Per the specification, each shim pack is nominally .063-inches thick. Each shim pack is made entirely of .003-inch laminated sheets. The math works out that each shim pack contains 21 laminated sheets, but this information is not important for ordering. The shim packs are ordered by pack, not by laminated sheet. To answer Neil's question, a quantity of 1,300 indicates 1,300 shim packs, not 1,300 laminated sheets.</p>

<DESC><p>This combined synopsis/solicitation is being amended to answer the following questions:<br /><br /><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">QUESTION 9: </strong>For item (2), the "Intel Xeon E5-2600 v3 family processors" is listed as plural. Does that mean you require the systems to have at least two each?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Or, would a single processor suffice?</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">ANSWER 9:</strong> <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A single processor in the Intel Xeon E5-2600 v3 family with at least 8 cores satisfies the requirement.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">&nbsp;<br /></strong><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">QUESTION 10: </strong><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>This requirement has <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>a 4U<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>24HDD are on the front of the chassis and with 2 array<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>24 in front and 12 in back - total of 36 drives. As a result, the front array will be OVER 100TB of data space which RHEL 6 does not cover - per my attached link(https://access.redhat.com/solutions/1532) . RHEL 7 does handle over 100TB EFS3 setup so after some research which version of Red Hat does the Government<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>want?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It's the NAVY 's choice on this.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We are just making you aware of it.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">ANSWER 10:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></strong>The front array will be broken in to multiple file systems of less than 100TB.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>RHEL 7 is not NIAP approved and therefore it cannot be used in our application yet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">&nbsp;<br /></strong><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">QUESTION 11: </strong>what are you connecting to with item # 7 and item # 8 ? (ex. HP MSA 2040, Dell MD3200 etc.)</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">ANSWER 11:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></strong>Item #7 will be used for JBODs to expand storage in the future.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Since this will be a separate competitive procurement in the future no brand or model will be specified.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Item #8 will be connected to external LTO-6 tape drive units when necessary to dump data directly into the NAS.<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"></strong></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><br />QUESTION 12:</strong> what are you connecting to with item # 11? (ex. Cisco Nexus, HP Pro Curve etc. )</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">ANSWER 12:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></strong>The 10GBase SFP+ ethernet ports will be connected to either Arista or Brocade switches.<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"></strong></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><br />QUESTION 13: </strong>Would the Navy customer consider using Oracle Linux instead of Redhat 6.0? Oracle Linux is the exact same operating systems as Redhat 6.0 with some added features. Oracle Linux is free to use and distribute. You would only need to pay for support, which is much more affordable. There are many other advantages of using Oracle Linux instead of Redhat Linux. Some include: Free downloads and distribution, Higher quality support and faster problem resolution, Ease of Deployment, Oracle Linux tracks the mainline Keneral closely, Management and clustering tools, Integrates with systems,Tested with Oracle Software and Systems - RHEL/ Redhat Linux is NOT tested with Oracle Software and Systems, Ease of doing business - Only have one vendor to work with.</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">ANSWER 13:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></strong>The requirement is for Red hat Enterprise Linux 6 server standard option.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Oracle Linux is not an acceptable substitution.<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"></strong></p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer.  If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. 

Election of Forum.  After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protestor agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum.  If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.

The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<p>The wage stated in the solicitation has been updated to state $21.43 for 23370 General Maintenance Worker.</p>
<p>Q6: Is it the Government's intent to limit the proposers to a single occupation classification, 23370 General Maintenance Worker, or to ensure that the bidders ensure whoever works on the project is paid according to the WD regardless of their occupation classification?</p>
<p>The intent is to ensure that the bidders ensure whoever works on the project is paid according to the wage determination regardless of their occupation classification. Additional occupation classifications, along with their wage determinations, have been added to the solicitation.</p>

<p>A list of the addresses and the corresponding number of washers and dryers located at each of those locations has been added to the solicitation. Please see page 13 for the list of locations.</p>
<p>Q9: Who will the COR coordinate with and will the successful bidder be required to perform the exchange of the beyond economical repair appliances as part of the FFP or is this action is performed by others?</p>

<SUBJECT>Market Survey for Request for Information (RFI) in support of Software Defined Radio Software Interoperability, Operation and Sustainment
<SOLNBR>W15P7T16R0007
<NTYPE>SRCSGT
<RESPDATE>121815
<CONTACT>Michael M. Gomes, Phone 4438614967, Email michael.m.gomes.civ@mail.mil
<DESC><p>1.0 Purpose<br />The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to gain knowledge of and help the Government understand vendor interest in providing software lifecycle support for the Department of Army (DA) Software Defined Radio (SDR) marketplace. This market survey is also to understand vendor interest and insights in maintaining SDR network interoperability in this marketplace that includes SDR terminals developed under government development contracts and industry innovation through internal investments. Information gathered from this survey will assist the Government in determining the acquisition strategy for SDR networking software in various phases of the product lifecycle (e.g. development - SDR integration - testing - fielding - sustainment). The Government's intent is to enable a mature SDR networking marketplace based on the most enhanced, operationally relevant, and sustainable tactical waveforms, Radio Frequency (RF) network services, and RF network management software available. The Government is currently contemplating a Multiple Award - Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (MA-IDIQ) contract with a base ordering period of five (5) years and an optional ordering period of five (5) years. <br />The information provided and received in response to this announcement is subject to the conditions set forth in FAR 52.215-3 -- Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes.<br /><br />2.0 Background<br />The Product Manager Waveforms (PdM WF) office is a critical piece of the Program Executive Office Command Control Communications-Tactical (PEO C3T) Project Manager Tactical Radios (PM TR) system portfolio focused on the delivery and sustainment of the lower and middle tier tactical RF networks for the DA. In order to enable and maintain network interoperability for tactical RF networks, PdM WF implemented a dual acquisition strategy that included government laboratories focused on SDR network management and terminal testing/certification in parallel with acquiring industry support in the development and sustainment for SDR network software products and services (e.g. Software In-Service Sustainment or SwISS). For Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) interoperability, PdM WF coordinates with the Navy's MUOS program office on SDR network and terminal testing/certification. PdM WF is investigating the optimum strategy to synchronize the fielding of enhanced or new tactical waveforms across all of the PM TR portfolio of SDRs. <br />This effort is currently being performed on contract N65236-11-D-4806 by GENERAL DYNAMICS C4 SYSTEMS INC. and on contract N66001-12-D-0043 by HARRIS CORPORATION. Contract N65236-11-D-4806 with a maximum value of $64,590,431.00 with an ordering period of 19NOV2010 - 19SEP2016. Contract N66001-12-D-0043 with a maximum value of $25,829,777.00 with an ordering period of 30APR2012 - 29APR2017.<br /><br />3.0 Requested Information<br />Interested vendors are invited to submit their prospective approach to include a description of the required software/hardware to meet the requirements listed in this section (3.0). Additionally, each vendor should provide a list of anticipated challenges (e.g. data right restrictions, intellectual property restrictions) and their prospective approach in assisting the Government in maintaining SDR network interoperability. Include corporate experiences, validation and/or verification data to allow for the Government to assess the maturity of any included technology, methodologies or processes. RFI anticipated requirements include:<br />(1) Maintain SDR networking waveforms (Soldier Radio Waveform-SRW, Wideband Networking Waveform-WNW, MUOS, Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System-SINCGARS, Ultra High Frequency Satellite Communication-UHF SATCOM) post Initial Operational Capability in a streamlined manner that allows for individual system Engineering Change Proposals and industry innovation but allows the Government to affordably manage SDR terminal interoperability<br />(2) Enhance SDR networks (networking and legacy), network services (e.g. Enterprise-Over The Air Management-OTAM) and network management software tools (e.g. Joint Enterprise Network Manager-JENM) in a manner that allows the government to distribute SDR network changes to other SDR terminal vendors to maintain terminal interoperability<br />(3) Introduction of new capabilities on existing SDR networks, network services and network management software tools synchronized across all PM TR SDR terminals. (e.g. SRW Narrowband, Coalition Wideband Networking Waveform)<br />(4) Support a robust SDR marketplace by (i) ensuring sufficient government data rights and configuration control of SDR network waveforms, network services and network management software and associated development tools, (ii) developing software and design artifacts to maximize portability (including the Software Communication Architecture and Application Programmable Interfaces), (iii) supporting a common development environment(s) that is readily available to the DA SDR Industry, and (iv) delivery of all artifacts to the Joint Tactical Networking Center (JTNC) Information Repository (IR)<br />(5) Adhere to a streamlined approach to meeting National Security Agency Information Assurance requirements and DA Risk Management Framework security requirements<br />(6) Ensure rigorous technology protection practices are adhered to during all phases of the product life-cycle. <br />(7) Support government configuration management of SDR networks, network services and network management software tools in an effective and efficient manner.</p>

Hereafter, the term #Request for Variance (RFV) # will also include Requests for Deviations and Waivers.</p>
<p>2. The definitions from EIA-649-1 apply to items being procured under this solicitation/contract, with the following clarification of Deviation &amp; Waiver:<br />A. Pre-Production RFV (previously known as deviation) requests permission to produce a product that does not conform to contract requirements/documentation for a limited amount of time and for specified effectivity. (A deviation differs from an engineering change in that an approved engineering change requires corresponding revision of the item's current approved configuration documentation, whereas a deviation does not.).<br />B. Post-Production RFV (previously known as waiver) requests approval of product found during manufacture, or after having been submitted for Government inspection or acceptance, that departs from specified requirements, but nevertheless is considered suitable for use "as is" or after repair by an approved method.</p>
<p>3. Contractor responsibilities.<br />A. An Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) is used to make permanent changes in the Government technical data package (TDP). Pending approval of an ECP, contractual relief should be requested in writing by the Contractor using a RFV.</p>
<p>B. Refer to FAR Part 48 Value Engineering for cost saving improvements to the Technical Data Package (TDP).</p>
<p>C. All ECPs submitted by the Contractor will be deemed routine. If the Contractor considers an ECP as an emergency or urgent; they shall include in their ECP submittal an explanation and all applicable supporting documentation. All ECPs will be reviewed for a determination on criticality, and, if concurred to be an emergency, the appropriate processing time-frame negotiated with the ESAs will be followed and the Contractor will be notified of anticipated response time.</p>
<p>D. For ECPs, Specification Change Notices (SCNs) or RFV, the Contractor must submit the applicable documentation listed in sub-paragraphs D.(1) through D.(4)to the Administrative Contracting Officer(ACO), with an information copy to the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO). Failure to submit a complete legible package may result in return of the ECP/RFV without processing.<br />(1) Documentation listed in Paragraph 3.3.1 (for ECPs), 3.3.2 (RFV), 3.3.3 (for SCNs) or 3.3.4 (for Notices of Revision (NORs)) of the latest revision of EIA-649-1.<br />(2) DD Form 1692 (current revision) for ECP.<br />(3) DD Form 1694 (current revision) for RFV.<br />(4) DD Form 1695 (current revision) for NOR.</p>
<p>4. DLA#s responsibilities:</p>
<p>A. Upon receipt of the ECP or RFV, the PCO will ensure that the applicable product specialist receives the copy from DCMA.</p>
<p>B. Within five (5) working days from the date of receipt of the Contractor's ECP or RFV from DCMA, the PS must submit the requests and any supporting documentation via a 339 to the appropriate Engineering Support Activity (ESA), when applicable.</p>
<p>C. Routine ECPs will be processed within 90 days from receipt by the ESA. RFVs will be evaluated and processed within 30 days from receipt by the ESA or as negotiated with the ESA.<br />(1) The contractor will be notified in writing of approval by the return of an approved copy of the ECP or RFV. Approval will be reflected by signature of the contracting activity or a review activity specifically identified in the contract.<br />(2) The contractor will be notified in writing of disapproval including reason(s) for disapproval.</p>
<p>5. For an approved RFV or an approved ECP, when the request affects the Contract, a modification will be issued to the contract incorporating the applicable requirement changes. Only a Contracting Officer is authorized to issue a modification incorporating the approved RFV and/or ECP.</p>
<p>6. Questions regarding the status of previously submitted ECP or RFV should be directed to the PCO.</p>
<p>7. The submission of an ECP or RFV by the Contractor does not affect the required delivery date of the contract. If a delivery date change is needed, it must be negotiated with the Contracting Officer and documented via modification to the contract.</p>
<p>8. The period of time for evaluation and approval/disapproval of an ECP and/or a RFV, as specified in Paragraph 4. C., shall not constitute excusable delay in the performance of this Contract by the Contractor or in any way relieve the contractor from compliance with the contract delivery schedule. The submission of an ECP and/or RFV by the Contractor shall not preclude the Government from exercising its rights under any clause of the Contract. (End)</p>

<DESC><p>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) and the PMA 231 E-2/C-2 Airborne Tactical Data System Program Office, are seeking eligible firms capable of providing an E-2C (Naval passenger aircraft) flight qualified keyboard that can be seamlessly integrated into the AN/ASQ-225 Q-70 Advanced Control Indicator Set (ACIS) bullnose assembly of the E-2C aircraft without modification to the existing hardware or on board software and that addresses Foreign Object Damage (FOD) concerns with keyboard keys popping of during routine flight operations. The E-2C aircraft directs and controls tactical operations for the Naval fleet and coordinates tactical operations with other services in a Joint environment. The systems that provide these functions include the Mission Computer (MC) and the tactical operator workstations. Each AN/ASQ-225 Q-70 Advanced Control Indicator Set (ACIS) tactical workstation is composed of a flat panel display, bullnose assembly, and integrated computer. The bullnose assembly provides operator input to the Q-70 ACIS workstation via an integrated keyboard and trackball. Recent fleet reports indicate the bullnose keyboard keys are popping off and becoming FOD inside the aircraft.</p>

 Potential vendors are hereby notified that the solicitation and subsequent amendments to the solicitation will ONLY be available for download at the above web sites. This office will no longer issue hard copy solicitations. By submitting a quote, the vendor will be self-certifying that neither the requestor nor the principal corporate officials and owners are currently suspended, debarred, or otherwise ineligible to receive contracts from any federal agency. Failure to do so may represent grounds for refusing to accept the quote. Through its submission, the vendor acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation, except for award to foreign vendors for work to be performed outside the United States.
 Lack of registration in the SAM database will make a vendor ineligible for award. Vendors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-999-227-8220, or via the Internet at http://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/. Please direct all questions regarding this requirement to William S. Powell at william.s.powell@navy.mil.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION 
FOR AN EXCEPTION TO FAIR OPPORTUNITY
   
1.	Contracting Activity: Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
Office of Acquisition Operations
      Technology Acquisition Center
      23 Christopher Way
      Eatontown, New Jersey 07724

2.	Description of Action: This proposed action is for a firm-fixed price delivery order to be issued under the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement (SEWP) V Governmentwide Acquisition Contract (GWAC). 

3.	Description of Supplies or Services: The proposed action is to provide brand name F5 Networks hardware maintenance coverage for VA Office of Information and Technology, Service Delivery and Engineering, Enterprise Operations (EO).  The F5 Networks will provide hardware maintenance coverage that will consist of hardware maintenance to repair or replace systems equipment components that restores full operation and accessibility to the original redundant component configuration; hardware maintenance services 24 hours a day x 7 days a week x 365 days per year; initial response to all requests for maintenance within one hour of the initial notification from VA; and response to all requests for on-site maintenance service by sending an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) qualified technician/engineer to the affected site within four hours of the initial notification from VA.  The hardware maintenance is required to ensure thehardware remains operational and EO is able to operate successfully.   The period of performance is 12 months from date of award.  

4.	Statutory Authority: The statutory authority permitting this exception to fair opportunity is Section 41 U.S.C 4106(c)(2) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Section 16.505(b)(2)(i)(B) entitled, "Only one awardee is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services ordered are unique or highly specialized."

5.	Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited: This is a brand name justification in accordance with FAR 11.105, Items Peculiar to One Manufacturer.  Based on extensive market research, as described in section 8 of this justification, it was determined that limited competition is viable among authorized resellers for the brand name F5 Networks hardware maintenance and update support as described in section 3 of this justification.  The current EO infrastructure is based on existing F5 Networks hardware and VA requires support compatible with the existing infrastructure protocols and functionality for continued operational availability, which includes OEM certified replacement parts and repair to restore the VA equipment to its highly redundant and fully operational state.  VA requires firmware upgrades and updates to include major releases, point releases, service releases of applicable firmware on a quarterly basis, or within 48 hours in cases where a high risk vulnerability fix becomes available.  No other hardware is compatible with or interoperable with the existing F5 Networks hardware.  As such, the firmware updates are required for the F5 Networks Load Balancers and only F5 Networks or an authorized reseller can provide the necessary hardware coverage, due to the proprietary nature.  VA requires continued hardware maintenance support for the F5 Networks products, and to use any other hardware would result in substantial duplication of costs.  No other source is capable of providing the aforementioned maintenance support to meet VA's requirements.  

6.	Efforts to Obtain Competition: Market research was conducted, details of which are in the market research paragraph of this document.  This effort did not yield any additional sources that can meet the Government's requirements.  It was determined, however, that limited competition is viable among authorized resellers for this brand name hardware maintenance.  In accordance with FAR 5.301 and 16.505(b)(2)(ii)(D), this action will be synopsized and the justification will be made publicly available on the Federal Business Opportunities Page within 14 days of award of the order.  
 
7.	Actions to Increase Competition: The Government will continue to conduct market research to ascertain if there are changes in the marketplace that would enable future actions to be fully competed. 

8.	Market Research: F5 Networks is a commercially available off-the-shelf maintenance package currently in use in VA.  The Government's technical experts conducted market research on web sites in January 2015, by reviewing other Network Load Balancer hardware maintenance products such as Barracuda, CISCO, Radware and Coyotepoint to ascertain if similar items could meet VA's requirements.  As a result of the market research, technical experts confirmed that as the nature of the hardware and updates thereto is proprietary, F5 Networks is the only source capable of providing maintenance coverage for F5 Networks hardware necessary to support existing EO requirements.  Additionally, none of these other hardware products could meet VA's interoperability and compatibility requirements as outlined in section 5 of this document.  Based on the above, only F5 Networks hardware maintenance meets all of the Government's requirements.

Additional market research was conducted by the Contracting Office in September 2015 utilizing the Provider Lookup Tool on the NASA SEWP V GWAC website, which found a total of 85 re-sellers of which 13 were Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business GWAC holders that can provide brand name F5 Networks hardware maintenance.  In addition, NASA SEWP V GWAC is a dynamic GWAC in which products can be added to vendor catalogs based on customer requests on a daily basis, as long as the required Information Technology item is within scope of the NASA SEWP V GWAC.  The requirements discussed herein have been found to be within scope of the NASA SEWP V GWAC in a separate determination.

Justification and Approval (J&A)
For
Other Than Full and Open Competition (>$150K)

1.	Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 23, Central Iowa Health Care System, Station # 636A6. 

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  
Service contract for preventive and emergency maintenance, including parts, chiller and coils of Siemens Biograph MCT-S320 PET-CT system at the Central Iowa VA Healthcare System.

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  
Service contract for preventive and emergency maintenance, including parts, chiller, coils of Siemens Biograph MCT-S320 PET-CT system at the Central Iowa VA Healthcare System.  The base year performance should be from 12/08/15 through 12/07/16 and include two option years. Estimated value would be $166,432.00/year or $499,296.00 for base year plus two options.

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  
Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;

This is a reference to the part of the Federal Acquisition Regulation that allows an item to be purchased without being fully competed.  This statement serves as a point of reference in case the justification is questioned.  In this case, it would be reviewed for its relativity to this part of the Federal Acquisition Regulation

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   
This system has proprietary software that is accessible for off-site troubleshooting through a VA National Site to Site VPN connection.  These connections must be approved by national ISO's and the companies trying to make these connections must have certain levels of security clearance.  There are also proprietary software keys used for troubleshooting that are accessible to Siemens/Cassling personnel only.



6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  
To my knowledge, there are no other companies that are able to offer this service in this area due to the unavailability of software maintenance access, and the level of security clearance and approvals needed for the VPN connection.  I have performed internet searches, checked the HISD website, which houses the entire approved Site to Site agreements, and also checked with peers in the VA.

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  
Based on industry standards, software support for medical equipment typically is charged at a rate anywhere from 5-10% of the acquisition price of the asset.  The asset included in this contract is worth $1,859,500, so a "fair" contract cost should be anywhere from $92,990 to $185,980.

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  
To my knowledge, there are no other companies that are able to offer this service due to the unavailability of software maintenance access, and the level of security clearance and approvals needed for the VPN connection.  I have performed internet searches, checked the HISD website, which houses the entire approved Site to Site agreements, and also checked with peers in the VA.

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  
There is no action the VA can take to increase competition for this scenario.  Any potential companies wishing to qualify for this procurement would have to obtain national site to site agreements with VA OI&T and have access to proprietary Siemens software.
10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  
Cassling Diagnostics/Siemens Medical, POC:  Lori Graff, lgraff@cassling.com, 402-334-5000 x1152
11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  
When replacement equipment is procured, that process will be done competitively.
