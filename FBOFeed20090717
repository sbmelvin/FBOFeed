<DESC><p>The National Science Foundation, National Nanotechnology Coordinating Office (NNCO), proposes to issue an order to the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) under the authority of FAR Part 13.5. Under the order, ANSI will provide for facilitation and supporting services for operation of the ANSI-Nanotechnology Standards Panel (NSP), ANSI Technical Advisory Group (TAG), and the International Standards Organization (ISO) Technical Committee on Nanotechnologies (TC 229) Working Group on Health, Safety, and Environment and ISO TC 229 Health, Safety, and Environment Working Group. This will include support such as meeting arrangements, outreach, conduct of meetings, act as Secretary of working groups, prepare reports, and establish and maintain websites.
<p>ANSI will manage the entire work program and operations of the NSP, the TAG, and the ISO TC 229 WG on HSE. ANSI is uniquely qualified to undertake this work because they serve as the cross-sector coordinating body and provide the framework within which stakeholders can work cooperatively to promote, accelerate and coordinate the timely development of useful voluntary consensus standards to meet identified research, development, and commercialization needs related to nanotechnology, including: terminology and nomenclature, metrology instrumentation and characterization, and environmental, health, and safety properties of nanotechnology-based materials and products.</p>

<DESC>NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the micro-Advance Stellar Compass (ASC) from theNational Space Institute Technical University of Denmark (DTU) under the authority ofOnly One Responsible Source, due to DTU being uniquely qualified as the only manufacturerof non-magnetic star trackers. DTU is the only organization that has a space-qualified, attitude determination device orstar camera that can be co-located at the magnetometer because ASC camera head units arenonmagnetic and therefore do not interfere with the very sensitive magnetometer sensors. In addition to the ASC camera head units magnetic cleanliness, their small size (~300cmcubed including baffle) and light weight (~0.4.kg) make them ideal for use in conjunctionwith magnetometer instruments at the end of a boom.  Furthermore, the low powerconsumption of the ASC, less than 7 Watts to operate 4 camera head units is ideal forpower constrained missions to the outer solar system.

(B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirements. (See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (d)(1)(B).)
This requirement is for major upgrades to NISTs existing Low-Temperature Horizontal and Vertical Magnetic-Field Probe Station System, which is used for low-temperature, low-electronic noise electrical probing of semiconductor and spintronic nanostructures.  These upgrades will allow the two magnetic field orientation probing stations of the original system to be operated simultaneously and independently. 

Sole source justification is based on the fact that only Lake Shore Cyrotronics has the detailed knowledge of the original unit and technical capabilities to successfully design the upgrade, deliver the components with the proper calibration information, and provide the installation assistance required to successfully implement the upgrade.

 Upgrades purchased from any other vendor would not provide the detailed mechanical and electrical designs and calibration curves for the thermometry that are required.  The electronics upgrades that are required are to upgrade an existing system which contains Lake Shore thermometers that have specific calibration curves are proprietary to Lake Shore.   These thermometers are integrated into the probe station and cannot be removed and replaced without major damage to the probe station.

The vacuum upgrades that are required must be sourced from Lake Shore, as only the Lake Shore system has the specific mechanical adaptor required to mate it with the existing Lake Shore low-temperature probe station.  The adaptor meets the specific geometry of the existing low-temperature probe station and is manufactured by Lake Shore specifically for this system. 

Lake Shore is the only known vendor capable of supplying the required electronics and vacuum upgrades and modifications to NISTs existing Low-Temperature Horizontal and Vertical Magnetic-Field Probe Station System.  Sourcing this upgrade from any other vendor would require that the entire Probe Station be reverse-engineered, incurring unacceptable and costly delays in research projects as well as unnecessary duplication of costs.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with Renishaw, Inc., of Hoffman Estates, Illinois, for the acquisition of a Dual Laser Interferometer System and Support Equipment to replace the interferometer currently being used as part of a high-accuracy measuring device in NISTs Manufacturing Engineering Laboratory. 

*** NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A) and (B) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.
(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in --
(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or
(B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirements. (See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (d)(1)(B).)
 
The Large Scale Coordinate Metrology Group of NISTs Manufacturing Engineering Laboratory requires a new dual laser interferometer system for use as a replacement of an existing Renishaw interferometer system which is part of a high-accuracy measuring device that is used to measure one dimensional length artifacts.     

NIST requires an interferometer that is a direct replacement for the existing Renishaw interferometer system due to the fact that custom software has been designed by NIST to interface with the Renishaw interferometer, and this software would need to be redesigned, at significant expense, to accommodate an interferometer from another manufacturer.  In addition, mounting hardware already in use on the high-accuracy measuring device was fabricated for a Renishaw interferometer.  Purchasing an interferometer from another manufacturer would require the removal of the existing mounting apparatus, as well as the time and expense involved in the development and fabrication of a new mounting apparatus.   

Renishaw has no authorized distributors for its equipment.  Renishaw, Inc. is thus the sole provider of this equipment.

Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractors commercial schedule.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  The Government will consider responses received by 3:00 p.m. (EST) on August 1, 2009.  Inquiries will only be accepted via email to paula.wilkison@nist.gov.  No telephone requests will be honored.   

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.

<DESC><p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Laboratory of Translational Genetics intends to procure on a sole source basis TaqMan Human microRNA Array A &amp; B and reagents with Applied Biosystems, 850 Lincoln Centre Drive, Foster City, CA 94404.<br /> <br />This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-(b)(1).  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 325413 and the business size standard is 500.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation.</p>
<p>The overall goal of the laboratory is to develop new approaches to the study of the genetic basis of cancer and its outcomes. Specifically, we will investigate the genetic basis of strong association signals identified in candidate gene association studies, loci identified by linkage analyses in high-risk families, or genome-wide association studies (GWAS), particularly the loci identified by the ongoing Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility (CGEMS) program.  This research utilizes molecular biology immunological, genetic and biochemical technologies.  The contractor shall provide 39 Taqman MicroRNA Assay Array Cards and the following reagents:</p>
<p>1.	Four (4) mirVana miRNA Iso Kit 10 -40 iso (2 pts)<br />2.	Three (3) FG, Taqman(r) microRNA RT Kit 1000rxns<br />3.	Eleven (11) Megaplex RT and Preamp Human Pools Set<br />4.	Two (2) FG,50mL Taqman UNIV PCR MSTR Mix<br />5.	Twelve (12) TF Taqman Preamp Master Mix with QRC</p>
<p>Salient Characteristics required of the TaqMan Human microRNA Array A &amp; B and reagents are:</p>
<p>1.	Reaction vessel uses microfluidic technology in a 384-well plate format.<br />2.	The reaction vessel has 8 sample loading ports and must use centrifugation to distribute the samples into each of the 48 wells serviced by each port.<br />3.	The reaction vessel is compatible with the Applied Biosystems 7900HT Sequence Detection System (a real-time PCR instrument).<br />4.	The reaction vessel is pre-loaded with pre-designed 5'-nuclease assays using TaqMan&reg; probes. <br />a.	The assay contains the necessary primers and probes to perform both reverse transcription of the targeted miRNA, and real time PCR detection of that miRNA transcript only. <br />b.	The assay id specific for the mature form of the miRNA transcript.<br />c.	The real time PCR detection method includes TaqMan&reg; probes (5' nuclease chemistry) with MGB quenching the 3' end of the probe.<br />d.	The TaqMan&reg; probe is cleaved when the probe hybridizes to the target.<br />e.	The assay has a minimum dynamic range of 6 logs.<br />5.	The contractor shall supply all the necessary consumables to perform real-time quantitative PCR, including PCR reagents designed for use with the fluorogenic 5' nuclease assay. All PCR reagents contain a passive internal reference dye to minimize well-to-well variability.<br />a.	TaqMan MicroRNA RT kit requires only 1-10 ng of total RNA or equivalent and is highly specific for only mature microRNAs.<br />b.	TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix contains all components needed for all 5' nuclease assays using TaqMan probe PCR applications.  Includes AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase which provides a better yield and more robust 5' nuclease activity.  Includes the passive reference required for signal normalization in all 5' nuclease assays.  Proprietary buffer enhancements add to the performance and reliability of the 5' nuclease assay.<br />c.	Megaplex Primer Pools provide comprehensive coverage of Sanger miRBase v10.  When used with the TaqMan MicroRNA Arrays they offer an ideal microRNA profiling solution.<br />i.	The Megaplex RT Primers are novel stem-looped RT primer pools that streamline the profiling of microRNA targets in a single reaction and reduces the number of RT reactions required.<br />ii.	Megaplex PreAmp Primers enhance the ability to detect low expressed microRNAs.  Enables the generation of a comprehensive expression profile from as low as 1 ng of input total RNA.<br />6.	The shall provide comprehensive assay design and development guidelines for real-time quantitative PCR.<br />7.	The shall provide Telephone Technical Support and Field Applications/Sales/Service Support to help solve chemistry and instrumentation problems encountered with real-time quantitative PCR.</p>
<p>Applied Biosystems technology is the only real time quantitative PCR method authorized to use microRNA TaqMan for:<br />a.	   High specificity (single base pair discrimination of mature miRNA); <br />b.	Sensitivity (single copy of target)<br />c.	   Linear Dynamic Range (7-9 logs of linear dynamic range)<br />d.	Ease of use: Easily implementable on existing 7900HT, with only 2 steps that take approximately 3-10 minutes total hands on time average per sample when operating in high throughput (15-30 minutes per sample hands on time in low throughput vs hours with microarrays)<br />e.	  Low sample input: Ability to assess single cells or low cell population (Non-biased assessment of single cells with the TaqMan Array). Ability to do Laser Capture Microdissection (LCM), FFPE (Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded) tissues, and every other tissue with minimally 1 cell and no limitation on abundent sample.<br />f.	  Highly parallel miRNA profiling/detection</p>
<p><br />Applied Biosystems has a portfolio of patented products in the TaqMan&reg;  product line that include TaqMan&reg; assays and TaqMan&reg; arrays with &gt;1,000,000 pre-designed quantitative assays that comprehensively cover 15 model genomes (Human, Mouse, Rat, Rhesus, Zebrafish, Chicken, Pig, Rice, Arabidopsis, Drosophila, C. elegans, Canine, Cow, Rabbit, and Horse). Applied Biosystems patent portfolio and exclusive licenses, which includes 5' Nuclease Assay and MGB technology, means that Applied Biosystems is the exclusive provider of TaqMan&reg; assays, TaqMan&reg; arrays, and TaqMan&reg; Preamplification products.  These assays have been developed through a highly optimized and automated design pipeline that has been wet chemistry validated across &gt; 200,000 unique assays.</p>
<p>Applied Biosystems is the only known source for the TaqMan MicroRNA Assay Array <br />Cards.  Use of a different platform would result in a decrease of sensitivity and<br />specificity.  Further, alternate platforms would require procurement of additional costly<br />equipment.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">A key challenge for clinical practice guidelines has
been to effectively translate the findings into tools and messages that result
in routine implementation into clinical practice.<span>&nbsp; </span>Past tobacco dependence treatment guidelines,
particularly the 2000 release, generated great interest (e.g. over 5 million
copies of guideline-related materials were produced and distributed by
AHRQ).<span>&nbsp; </span>There is also evidence that
practice changes have resulted, based on consumer and provider surveys. The
expanded use of the EMR in clinical practice settings over the last decade,
which is likely to accelerate with new Federal support for EMR adoption,
creates an important new opportunity to provide turnkey modules and feedback
mechanisms that can be readily integrated into the EMR, resulting in
improvements in health care delivery and quality of care.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>

Part I: Background information and description of requirements:

The Genetics Branch of the Center for Cancer Research at the National Cancer Institute is engaged in the study of cancer genetics. Investigating genetic alteration and its effect on the development and biology of cancer is an integral function of The Genetics Branch. By using ultra-high throughput, next generation sequencing, and whole-genome high-resolution beadchip reagents, the lab is able to study DNA/promoter interactions, gene expression, methylation status, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), and investigate genomic rearrangements at resolutions at informatics levels never before possible.

Due to recent and foreseen increases in the demand for second- generation pyrosequencing of human pathogens and/or the host, the Genomics Core facility requires an apparatus for DNA template shearing and disruption of bead emulsions for second-generation DNA sequencing, template library preparation involves production of a random collection of adapter-modified DNA fragments. In some applications, such as variant detection or the re-sequencing of amplicons, a very tight fragment size distribution is required.  


JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION:

Part II: Facts and Reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition: 

Statutory Authority 

Statute: This justification has been prepared under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1) as set forth in 13.106-1 (b)(1).

(b) Soliciting from a single source.

(2) For sole source acquisitions of commercial items in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold conducted pursuant to subpart 13.5, the requirements at 13.501(a) apply. 

 No other requirement and/or type for supply or service will satisfy   agency need.  

Justification:  

Ultrasonic digestion is different from shearing techniques due to its  focused acoustic shock waves which is effective for shearing DNA fragments >300bp and intense mixing or disruption of tissues. Process time must be balanced with temperature control to prevent loss of sample integrity. The Covaris Ultrasonicator is advanced compared to standard sonicators in the general market due to vast improvement in the shearing mechanism which is also needed to achieve the level and quality of research required from the established Next-Generation sequencing experiments and methods currently used within the lab.

Covaris is the sole source offering shearing formats that to be utilized on pre-established scientific protocol and methods of the Next Generation Sequence Analyzers. They are manufactured to allow for custom design of DNA shearing necessary by out protocols.   This custom DNA shearing is in condition essential for Next Generation Sequencers already in place in the Genetics Branch.  No other sonication instrument exists in the general lab market place that will work seamlessly with the Next-Generation Sequence Analyzers. Other instruments cannot fragment or shear DNA molecule to a size required by Next Generation protocols and methods. For these reasons, no other source is known to the NCI to comply with the needs of the lab.

The following salient characteristics apply to the Covaris S2 High Performance Ultrasonicator:

	Adaptive focused acoustic process to produce a controlled acoustic field inside  a closed vessel

	Dish shaped transducer to converge energy to small localized areas


	Utilizes an isothermal process that eliminates any potential temperature aggregation

	Utilizes a 500 MHz transducer enabling high frequency focused ultrasonic    energy outside the human audible range

	Easily configured to various tubes and vials for versatility

	Operates using microtubes holding 100ul for reduced sample volume

	Utilizes multiple solvents (aqueous, organic)

	Rapid, scalable energy to quickly stabilize target  molecules

	Non-contact processing to avoid tissue disruption for RNA and protein targets

Part I: Background information and description of requirements:

The Laboratory of Receptor Biology and Gene Expression (LRBGE)/Chromatin Structure and Epigenetic Mechanisms Unit are currently conducting research into molecular mechanisms and causes of chromosome/genomic instability caused in colorectal cancer cells, the human genome project, and other sequencing comprising of various organisms. 

The lab focuses on centromeres and the CenH3 protein to elucidate the relationship between histone variants, chromatin fiber structure, assembly/disassembly dynamics and biological function in cancer cells with the hope of eventually determining if anti-centromere peptides could provide therapeutic potential to halting the progress of cancers since all dividing cells require an active centromere. Centromeres are the visually striking central constriction seen eukaryotic mitotic chromosomes, and are the site for microtubule attachment. The current goals of the lab to be reached with acquisition of such a microscope are to elucidate how CenH3 nucleosomal structural variation alters through the cell cycle and how assembly and disassembly kinetics influence the cetromeric chromatin fiber accessibility and uniformity in cancer cells, and how the global chromatin fiber's three-dimensional arrangement is altered when the individual nucleosomes that make up the fiber are replaced by CenH3 variants as in cancer cells.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION:

Part II: Facts and Reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition: 

Statutory Authority 

Statute: This justification has been prepared under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1) as set forth in 13.106-1 (b)(1)

(b) Soliciting from a single source.

(2) For sole source acquisitions of commercial items in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold conducted pursuant to subpart 13.5, the requirements at 13.501(a) apply. 

 No other requirement and/or type for supply or service will satisfy   agency need.  

Justification:  

To encompass the multiple high resolution nanoscale studies, the lab is proposing to purchase the Agilent AFM 5500 ILM Instrument System as a fully integrated modular instrument system. The AFM system enables single molecule observation, in-solution biochemistry and analysis of chromatin samples extracted from tumor samples. This is important to current research into the molecular mechanisms of chromosome breakage in colorectal cancer cells. The AFM system is required for direct control of the pre-analytic steps (sample preparation, observation, in-solution biochemistry, force measurements, protein-protein interaction) as well as post analysis steps (topography measurement and imaging). Currently such a microscope is not available within the LRBGE, which has led to a request for the acquisition of an AFM system from Agilent Technologies. In addition to the studies mentioned above, a long term goal to combine optical fluorescent imaging using fluorescently tagged CenH3 and other proteins that can be tracked across the cell cycle and magnified. These goals are only capable with utility of the Agilent atomic force microscopy unit. 

All Agilent machines are built using a modular assembly making ease of swapping units or upgrading features virtually effortless. In addition, output and analysis software included with the instrument is user friendly and requires minimal training for the end-user. The data collection computer can therefore be utilized at peak efficiency by being dedicated to machine operation, while all analyses are performed on remote machines by individual users. The Agilent AFM 5000 ILM instrument and available technology is manufactured and patented by Agilent Technologies which leaves them as the sole source vendor for this acquisition. No other source is known to the NCI who can comply or manufacturer what is being requested by the lab.

The following salient characteristics apply to the Agilent Atomic Force Microscope 550 ILM:

	Highly modular system allows for unparalleled flexibility
	Environmental/Temperature control of macromolecules that do not exceed  2 F 
	Humidity variation which does not exceed  20% RH
	Acoustic noise not to exceed 75 dBc
	Hermetically sealed scanners
	Superior scanning under any condition including fluids, gases or ambient conditions that occur
	High-resolution scanner with large scan range of 90 &#956;m x 90 &#956;m
	Vertical sample approach

Description
This contract action is for services for which NAVFAC FAR EAST, Facilities Engineering and Acquisition Division (FEAD) Yokosuka intends to solicit and negotiate with only Toshiba Corporation under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, since the frequency converter is not stand-alone equipment when considering the whole base electrical system.  The frequency converter is electronically connected to the centralized computer system called Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA).  The SCADA system picks up various electrical data from the entire base electrical systems including frequency converters to properly monitor and control the entire system.  Therefore, the frequency converters must be overhauled, maintained and repaired in a way that compatible to the SCADA.  Using a different company's converter would lead the Government to change the whole other existing supportive equipment.  The converter manufacture by the other companies is not adaptable to an existing SCADA system that has to work synchronously with the converter.  The proposed contract action is for commercial supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, the Government will consider all correspondence received no later than 16 August 2009.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

This is an 8(a) competitive procurement to Grunley/ Goel JV LCC (N62477-06-D-0004), FEMCO, Inc. (N62477-06-D-0499), Donley-Kirlin JV (N62477-06-D-0498), and GDI/ Allen & Shariff JV (N62477-06-D-0500) 
Title: REPAIR ALARM SYSTEMS
The work includes new fire alarm installations and incidental related work.  There will be four new fire alarm systems (mirroring the existing fire alarm systems) in this project and the fire alarm system being installed in Building 9 to cover approximately half of that building under the BRAC project will be extended to the rest of the building. The new systems will serve: Building 1, Building 2/7/8, Building 4/6 and Building 10.  Each system is being designed to meet NFPA 72, UFC and UFGS requirements.  Buildings 1-8 will also have speaker placement which meets the UFC 4-021-01 performance requirements for mass notification, most notably the requirement for 0.8 intelligibility, not just the NFPA 72 requirement for audibility (15 dB over ambient noise levels).  Each system will be stand-alone, however, the project also includes networking the systems together so that the status of current alarms can be read from any fire alarm control panel or annunciator panel in the complex.  Fire alarm annunciator panels will also be provided at one or more entry point in some buildings per the request of the base fire department. This network is also extended to the base fire station to provide the required monitoring of all signals and emergency notification for fire department response.  Each fire alarm system will utilize an audio-visual fire alarm notification system using a voice evacuation system which will include provisions for the use of the fire alarm speakers and strobes for mass notification.  Performance period is estimated at 910 calendar days from date of award. The North American Classification System Code for this project is 236220. The RFP will be sent to NAVFAC Washington's 8(a) MACC Contractors Grunley/ Goel JW LCC, FEMCO, Inc., Donley-Kirlin JV, and GDI/ Allen & Shariff JV.  The estimated release of the RFP is 20 July 2009.  The time frame for receipt of proposals will be provided in the solicitation.

FBO is the primary point of entry to be used when access to synopses and solicitations from the World Wide Web is required.  However, the NECO webpage as well as the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Acquisition webpage serve as alternatives if the FBO website is unavailable.The Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane intends to enter into an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with Teradyne, 600 Riverpark Dr. North Reading, MD 01864-2634.  The IDIQ will cover a five year period to procure Teradyne 9100 Spectrum testers and associated spare equipment, instrument calibration, and maintenance.  Inspection and Acceptance will be at Destination, and delivery requirements will be defined at the delivery order level.  These units will be used in support of the Strategic Systems Program's (SSP) Trident II D5 Life Extension requirements.  This will be a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract.  Procurements under the IDIQ will be conducted on a sole-source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  The basis for restricting competition is that Teradyne, being the Original Equipment Manufacturer, is the only known source for each of the items that can satisfy the Government's requirements, and it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered!  through competition.  This procurement will utilize the alpha contracting process and the solicitation will not be posted to the www, but will be made available to anyone requesting a copy.  All changes to the requirement that occur prior to the closing date, 31 August 2009, will be posted to Crane web site, FedBizOpps, and NECO.  It is the responsibility of interested vendors to monitor the Crane web site, FedBizOpps and/or NECO for any additional amendments that may be issued.  For changes made after the closing date, only those offeror's that provide a proposal will be provided any changes/amendments and considered for future discussions and/or award.

<DESC><p>The NRC is responsible for ensuring adequate safety and security for radioactive materials, including transactions involving radioactive materials, and the materials licensing process. This project directly supports these goals by providing a secure and effective set of automated tools to house and maintain information on licensees, nationally tracked sources possessed by licensees, and licensee transactions. The NRC seeks contractor support for the planning, acquisition, system certification, development, deployment, hosting, and maintenance of NRC's Integrated Source Management Portfolio (ISMP) project. The portfolio consists of three systems, two that are in the planning stages the License Verification System (LVS) and the Web Based Licensing (WBL) System; and one system already in operation the National Source Tracking System (NSTS).
<p>Within the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the Office of Federal and State Materials and Environmental Management Programs (FSME) develops, implements and oversees the regulatory framework for industrial, commercial, and medical uses of radioactive materials, uranium recovery activities, and the decommissioning of previously operating nuclear facilities and power plants. In addition, FSME conducts extensive environmental assessments in Support of these regulatory functions. Our regulatory work is done in a manner that protects public health and safety, provides for the common defense and security, and protects the environment. We implement these regulatory programs in coordination with our partners at other Federal agencies, the States, the NRC Regions, and Tribal governments.</p>
<p>The events of September 11, 2001 heightened the nation's concern regarding the use of radioactive materials for a malevolent act. The potential for such an attack has been of particular concern because of the widespread use of radioactive materials (often contained in sealed sources) in the United States and abroad by industry, hospitals, and academic institutions. A major impetus for this project is the need to control nuclear materials that could be used in a radiological dispersal device (RDD) or "dirty bomb" - a conventional explosive that carries nuclear materials and releases them on detonation. The NRC has been proactively working on material "real time" tracking capability since 2005.</p>
<p>In late 2006 and early 2007, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) conducted a test on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's controls governing the issuance of licenses for possessing certain types of radioactive materials and for enforcing possession limits on the quantities of those materials. Subsequently, GAO reported that they were able to obtain radioactive materials licenses for two fabricated companies, modify the licenses to raise the possession limits, and utilize the augmented licenses to receive quotes for purchasing radioactive materials from legitimate licensees.</p>
<p>At a July 12, 2007 Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI) hearing following GAO's report, it was suggested that the NRC should consider establishing a web-based licensing (verification) system that would allow suppliers to validate purchaser licenses and the authorized quantity that a purchaser could obtain. Former NRC Commissioner, Edward McGaffigan Jr., stated that information technology (IT) is one area in which NRC should improve to prevent fraudulent radioactive material license claims and alteration of possession limits. GAO, NRC, and Congress deemed this as a necessary and urgent IT initiative to protect the nation from the threat of malevolent use of nuclear materials.</p>
<p>In an effort to better track radioactive materials, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission developed a comprehensive Action Plan outlining a number of specific steps to address the concerns raised by the GAO report and in the Senate Committee hearing. This plan consists of a portfolio of automated tools for credential tracking (license and certificate), inspection tracking, item tracking (devices and sources), event tracking, license verification, and financial interfacing. Initial development efforts that are included in the portfolio were - (1) the National Source Tracking System (NSTS), (2) the Web-Based Licensing (WBL), system and (3) the License Verification System (LVS). NSTS is currently in the final stages of development. A description of each system is provided below.</p>
<p>National Source Tracking System (NSTS)</p>
<p>The National Source Tracking System (NSTS), which has been under development since 2003, is a tracking system for the transfer of responsibility of sealed sources of radioactive materials. This tracking spans the life cycle of the source from manufacture through shipment receipt, decay, and burial. It supports controlled authorizations and accountability for licensed suppliers and licensed recipients of sealed sources. The successful implementation of NSTS will satisfy NRC's commitment to Congress to develop source tracking regulations as envisioned in the International Atomic Energy Agency's Code of Conduct in 2004. NSTS was given authority to operate (ATO) in December 2008. NSTS is a Level 4 system has a "High" security categorization.</p>
<p>Web-Based Licensing System (WBL)</p>
<p>The Web-Based Licensing System (WBL) is envisioned as a NRC material licensing system for managing licensing information for businesses using radioactive materials. The NRC web-based licensing system includes the licensing life cycle from initial application, license issuance, amendment, reporting, and de-licensing. Designed to maintain information on NRC material licensees, it is planned to support an interface for inclusion of licensing information from 36 Agreement States which support and manage their own material licenses. In addition, this requirement entails developing a web-based interface for materials Licensees; and replacing while improving upon the functionality currently embodied in several of the NRC's legacy systems; namely, the License Tracking System (LTS), the Inspection Planning System (IPS), Reciprocity Tracking System (RTS), and Transportation Approval Package Information System, (TAPIS). WBL is a Level 3 system and has a "Moderate" security categorization.</p>
<p>License Verification System (LVS)</p>
<p>The License Verification System (LVS) is envisioned as a "national verification system" that would access NRC and Agreement State licensee information and be used for purposes of detecting and preventing unauthorized parties with malicious intent from obtaining nuclear materials. The LVS is planned to be an integrated service that shall broker information stored in WBL and NSTS to provide the validations to ensure that (a) a license is valid and accurate; (b) a licensee is authorized for acquiring quantities and types of radioactive materials; and (c) the current levels of licensee inventory tracked sources is within the possession limits. The LVS will be designed to handle request transactions for validation functions. It shall work in much the same way as the approval process for a credit card purchase. When a merchant checks to verify a credit card the only information returned is whether or not the transaction is approved. LVS will take in the validation request and, through examination of information available from both NSTS and WBL, will provide a response indicating whether or not a license is valid and a pending purchase is within the bounds of the possession limits and inventory. LVS is a Level 3 system that has a "Moderate" security categorization.</p>
<p><br />Under this requirement, the contractor shall perform development, testing, training, and deployment of the LVS and WBL systems; and Maintenance and Operational (M&amp;O) support, user support, and hosting of LVS, WBL, and NSTS. The contractor shall comply with all Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) guidance for Level 4 authentication. The facility shall provide general hosting and operational support for a system requiring High confidentiality, High integrity, and High Availability. All hardware and software shall comply with Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140 2. The hosting infrastructure shall include at least two geographically disparate sites to provide remediation from emergencies. The system shall employ a multi-tiered web architecture with levels of redundancy to ensure automatic failover.</p>
<p><br />It is anticipated that the contract will be a labor hour type contract.</p>
<p>The period of performance of the resultant contract will be 10 years (one base period of 4 years and three additional two-year optional periods.<br />The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available on or about July 31, 2009 and will be distributed solely through the FedBizOpps website, http://www.fedbizopps.gov.

DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation (Corporation) plans to issue an Invitation For Bids (IFB) for furnishing all plant, labor, equipment and materials and for performing all work for replacing the 1950s vintage electromechanical operating machinery and control with hydraulic machinery and PLCs to operate the filling and emptying valves at Eisenhower and Snell Locks in Massena, New York.  The filling and emptying valves are reverse tainter valves and are approximately 15 feet x 15 feet and operate under a 43 foot differential head.  The project is to replace the electromechanical equipment with one (1) hydraulic power unit for each valve; however each hydraulic power unit is sized to operate a miter gate leaf and ship arrestor equipment in the future.  The work includes, but is not limited to demolition and placement of concrete; removal of existing components that are not being reused,and refurbishing of components that will become part of the new operating equipment; installation of the hydraulic power units, cylinders and piping; installation of wiring and making all required electrical connections; and installation of PLCs, performing the programming to operate the new equipment and integrating these controls with the existing lock controls.  Plans are to award a contract for replacement of the operating machinery and control for four (4) valves (one (1) filling and one (1) emptying valve at the north side of Eisenhower Lock and one (1) filling and one (1) emptying valve at the north side of Snell Lock) prior to September 30, 2009 with the on site portion of the work to be completed while the Seaway is closed to navigation during winter 2011, approximately between January 1, 2011 and March 15, 2011.  It is critical that this timeframe be adhered to because failure of this equipment to operate on or before March 15, 2011, could cause the entire Seaway system to remain closed to navigation. The bid documents will include an optional requirement for award prior to September 30, 2011 for the operating machinery and controls for the remaining four (4) valves (the south side filling and emptying valves at Eisenhower and Snell Locks) with the work to be completed between January 1, 2012 and March 15, 2012 or January 1, 2013 and March 15, 2013, dependent upon when the optional requirement is awarded.  The project cost range is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000. The applicable NAICS code is 237990 with a size standard of $33.5 M.  Drawings are available on CD for $20.00 US funds or hard copy for $300.00 US funds. The Invitation for Bid (IFB) package will be issued approximately August 3, 2009 with a bid opening date on or about September 15, 2009.  A firm fixed price contract shall be awarded.  Mail your request for the IFB package along with the above fee to Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation, Attn:  Contracting Office, PO Box 520, 180 Andrews Street, Massena, New York 13662.  All responsible sources may submit a bid which shall be considered by the Corporation.  This procurement is subject to the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program and is open to both small and large business.  Prospective offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) to be eligible for award.  Please register with the CCR at www.ccr.gov.  Attention:  The Department of Transportation (DOT) Short Term Lending Program (STLP) offers financial assistance to eligible disadvantaged, Hubzone, or service disabled veteran owned businesses.  Maximum line of credit is $750,000.00 with interest at the prime rate, as published in the Wall Street Journal, plus 2 points.

<DESC>NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) is partnering with the Operationally ResponsiveSpace Office (ORS) located at Kirtland Air Force Base in Albuquerque, New Mexico toestablish the Rapid Response Space Works (formerly known as "Chile Works").  NASA ARCwill serve as lead executing agent with overall contracting, programmatic and systemsengineering responsibilities.PLEASE NOTE: This notice is issued by the NASA/ARC to solicit responses from interested parties.  Thisdocument is for information and planning purposes and to allow industry the opportunityto verify reasonableness and feasibility of the requirement, as well as promotecompetition. Detailed requirements for the acquisition have not been finalized, nor havethe specifics for the acquisition strategy been determined. Prospective offerors are invited to submit written comments or questions to: PatriciaHudson, no later than July 31, 2009.  When responding reference Rapid Response SpaceWorks (RRSW).Comments may be forwarded to Patricia.B.Hudson@nasa.gov via electronic transmission or byfacsimile transmission at 650-604-4646.This preliminary information is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government,nor will the Government pay for the information submitted in response.	Respondents willnot be notified of the results.Background: The ORS Offices mission is to plan and prepare for the rapid development of highlyresponsive space capabilities. The ORS Office will pursue innovative and affordableapproaches through basic research, applied research and advanced development focused on(but not limited to) payloads, buses, ground infrastructure and launch systems.The ORS Office is tasked with establishing the ability to provide rapid end-to-endcapability efforts to meet time-critical operational needs of the Joint Force Commanders(JFCs).  The ORS Office plans to standup this capability over time with a phased crawl,walk, and run approach.  Responsiveness is defined by the length of time required todeliver ORS capabilities.  Achieving the timelines may not be possible at the outset, butwill remain an important goal as the ORS program matures: -	EMPLOY:  On-demand use of existing deployed assets in applications that mayextend or expand their original purpose.  The objective of employment is to deliver thesecapabilities within minutes to hours.  Other elements of the National Security Space(NSS) community have the primary responsibility for identifying and executing theseinitiatives.-	DEPLOY:  Deploying new or additional capabilities that are field-ready, thatis, already produced.  The objective of deployment is to deliver capabilities within daysto weeks.-	DEVELOP:  The rapid development, delivery, and employment of a new capability. The objective of development is to deliver capabilities within months and less than oneyear.  Development comprises the primary office activity focused on maturing the ORSenabling elements.Anticipated initial mission types include:Low Earth Orbit (LEO):-	Tactical Surveillance-	Electro-Optical (EO) Visible/Near Infrared Imager (EO/VNIR)-	EO/Shortwave-Infrared Imager (EO/SWIR)-	Hyperspectral Imager (HSI)-	Deep Space Object Search and Track (DS SSA)-	Synthetic aperture radar-	Space Situational Awareness (SSA)-	Space Protection-	Highly Elliptical Orbit (HEO):-	Tactical communications-	SATCOM -	Blue Force Tracking (BFT)-	Tactical Surveillance-	Kinetic Event Detection Battlespace Awareness-	Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO):-	Space Situational Awareness-	Space ProtectionScope:The Rapid Response Space Works (RRSW) and Space Vehicle procurement has two primaryobjectives. The first objective is to standup initial operations of the RRSW.  Thisobjective creates the ability for the ORS Office to meet its Deploy mission capabilityof rapidly deploying capabilities to the warfighter within days to weeks.  The secondobjective is to procure, outside of the RRSW, modular multi-mission space vehicles and/orbuses and payloads for the RRSW.  The first planned procurement is for a modularSynthetic Aperture Radar Satellite (SARSat). In close cooperation and coordination withthe RRSW and ORS Office, modular spacecraft will be designed, integrated, tested,launched, and will be controlled and operated to meet the RRSW responsive concept. Thearchitecture developed for these responsive, modular spacecrafts will be designed in sucha way as to allow flexibility to meet multiple missions with minimal changes within thebasic design. The spacecraft architecture will include a multi-mission, modular busdesign and multi-mission, modular payload designs (mission kits will includeelectro-optical and RF payloads).Objective:The ORS vision for the RRSW is to develop a long term capability which establishesoperations to rapidly assemble, test, and launch small space vehicles in the Deploymission timeframe and then transition that capability to an operational DoD unit to meetORS2015 End State Vision. The vision establishes the initial operating capability(operations, processes, and functions of the RRSW) by the 2012-2013 timeframe and a fulloperational capability by 2015.The contemplated contracting options include one solicitation managed by NASA Ames.  Ofthis solicitation there may be multiple awards.  One award for a single IDIQ contract forthe stand-up and initial operations of the RRSW and multiple awards (Basic OrderingAgreements (BOA) or multi-award IDIQs) for systems, i.e., space vehicles, buses andpayloads.  We anticipate the RRSW award would be a 5 year IDIQ contract that consists ofa 3 year base with two one-year options. Additionally, we anticipate awarding multiplefive-year Space Vehicle BOA or IDIQ contracts to the most qualified contractors capableof providing the modular space vehicles, buses and modular payloads to meet the ORSmission set.  Both of these efforts are planned to be International Traffic in ArmsRegulations (ITAR) restricted and operate at least at a DoD Secret level.  The individualtask orders on the multiple BOA or IDIQ contracts will specify the mission requirement,whether the call is for a space vehicle, or just a payload or bus, and will establish theperiod of performance.The procurement ceiling for this effort has been established as $300 million shared overthe multiple contracts over the five-years to allow for flexibility in meeting rapidresponse requirements that include the procurement of multiple space vehicles, buses,payloads, and/or components.Contractor Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) Plans will be evaluated in theirability to mitigate interactions and potential conflicts between RRSW and Space Vehiclecontracts.  We anticipate simultaneously awarding the RRSW Basic contract and the first task order. The initial task order will be to establish the early rudimentary operations of the RRSW. The ORS Office is looking for innovative approaches and what industry believes would bethe best approach to meet this requirement. The ORS Office envisions that allcapabilities developed for the RRSW will be owned by the government, open source andavailable on future efforts for the RRSW. Future task orders will be added as the ORSmission dictates and could include integration of missions, procurement of establishedcomponents, and execution of mission capability.  It is anticipated that the RRSW will inthe final vision be a government facility on Kirtland AFB, however, early options mayinclude nearby offsite contractor run operations.We also anticipate simultaneously awarding several BOA or IDIQ contracts to vendorscapable of providing modular space vehicles, buses and payloads to meet the ORS missionset.  The initial task order will be a one year service level to participant in anInnovation-Node with the RRSW contractor to develop ORSs CONOPS and open systemstandards.  We also expect to award either one task order to design, build and deliverthe first article for a complete ORS SARSat or award two separate task orders with onebeing a SARSat bus and the second being a SARSat payload. The task order(s) is envisionedto have an objective launch date of December 2012.  Key to this launch is the end-to-enddemonstration of the ORS Tier-2 Deploy CONOPs where the modular bus and payloaddeveloped for this mission will have a final assembly, integration, and test in the RRSWand will meet the Deploy objective timelines. Additional task orders will be added asfunding becomes available and may include additional or new bus, payload, and/or spacevehicle procurements.An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B".Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<DESC><p>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY!
<p>The Department of Justice is developing an acquisition strategy for a Mail Management, Warehousing, and Related (MMW&amp;R) support services requirement which provides mail operations; distribution, copying, warehousing services to include moving and storage; as well as other general support services to the Offices, Boards, Divisions and Bureaus within the Department of Justice (Department or DOJ) and other Federal agencies nationwide. As part of this process, we are seeking information about small businesses that are capable of providing the services outlined in the attached draft Statement of Work (SOW). Please note that this is a market survey for informational purposes only and is not a Request for Proposals (RFP). No contract will be awarded based on this announcement and no reimbursement will be made for costs associated with responding to this announcement. All responses must be submitted via e-mail in accordance with the instructions that follow.</p>
<p>The work outlined in the draft SOW covers the services such as primary mail sorting for all of DOJ mail in the Washington Metropolitan Area; opening, logging, processing and distributing incoming mail; maintaining a 24 hour per day, five day per week operation for warehousing functions and moving services; and providing general support services. It is worth noting that a significant portion of this requirement will be obtained under the Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) administrative type contract. Many of the administrative, mail and warehousing functions are co-located and staffing for these services is intermingled. For example, the Facilities &amp; Administrative Services Staff (FASS) uses staff from one function to substitute and replace staff under another function when requirements dictate the need.</p>
<p>The contractor shall be responsible for mailroom operations, warehousing functions and general support services to include, but not limited to; <br />1. Material and equipment receiving, handling and storing; shipping; palletizing; and conducting inventories of various material, equipment and other products;<br />2. Dispatching, delivery, and pick-up of property both to and from DOJ Offices in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area; <br />3. Providing the tools, equipment, labor and material necessary to successfully perform the warehousing and moving service functions; <br />4. Copying, reproduction and related services, as well as secretarial and related services.</p>
<p>The contractor shall be responsible for providing and supervising sufficient qualified staff (estimated at 300 positions) to support the requirements within the SOW. Furthermore, of the estimated 300 positions, approximately 100 positions will require Top Secret clearances. Personnel must clear a background investigation consisting of a Minimal Background Investigation (MBI), credit check and fingerprints. The resulting contract will be available for use by all of DOJ and other Federal agencies but the primary focus will be on the DOJ and its Offices, Boards, Divisions and Bureaus.</p>
<p>The resulting contract will include a combination of Firm Fixed Price (FFP) and Labor Hour (LH) contract pricing arrangement and includes both a Definite Quantity, Definite Delivery portion and an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) portion. The anticipated contract will include a Base Period and four (4) one year Option Periods. Additionally, the Contractor may earn up to two additional one year "Award Term"&nbsp;periods based on overall performance as measured by the Award Term Evaluation Plan (Section J, Attachment 13). The predominant place of performance is the Washington, DC Metropolitan area with some staffing to be provided in Quantico, VA.</p>
<p>Responses to this announcement must provide detailed, concise information about the company's qualifications and experience in providing support services similar in size, scope and complexity, as identified in the attached draft statement of work within the past three (3) years. Project information shall include the contract number, dollar value, period of performance, current status, and current point of contact information including name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address.

<SUBJECT>Recovery Act Contract Action - Providing radiologic outcomes for the Osteoarthritis Initiative through longitudinal, blinded to order qualitative and quantitative assessment x-ray analysis of knee joint changes
<SOLNBR>HHS-NIH-NIAMS-RDSS-10-20
<RESPDATE>072709
<ARCHDATE>11022009
<CONTACT>Lisa A Hill, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-435-0346, Fax 301-480-3432, Email lh314r@nih.gov
<DESC>RECOVERY ACT CONTRACT ACTION  This is a sources sought synopsis. This is not a Request for Proposals. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, on behalf of the National Institute for National Institute of Arthritis Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) issues this source sought notice in an effort to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform this requirement.  Small businesses are encouraged to respond. The period of performance is eleven months with the option to extend the contract for an additional year. 

The Osteoarthritis Initiative is a public-private partnership to generate research resources to increase knowledge and improve understanding of the onset and progression of knee osteoarthritis in the population.  The goals of the Osteoarthritis Initiative are currently being fulfilled through five current NIH funded research and development contracts.  Four of these contracts are awarded to clinical centers to enroll subjects, collect data and follow the cohort, and one contract is the data coordinating center, the University of California, San Francisco to manage the study and to establish and maintain the database.  The purpose of this requirement is to provide x-ray readings and scoring of knee x-rays from the baseline, 12, 24, 36, and 48 month x-rays from the participants of the Osteoarthritis Initiative.  This will provide outcome data to enrich the database.  These readings will allow users to know whether subjects without disease have developed disease or subjects with disease have gotten worse.  This information is critical for evaluation of potential risk factors for development or progression of disease.  Providing these readings through a standardized method will eliminate the variability that would result from many different individuals reading these x-rays independently. The resultant data will be posted on the Osteoarthritis Initiative public website after review by the staff at the data coordinating center at the UCSF. Two types of readings, done in a blinded to order manner are required: quantitative assessment of joint space width and change in joint space and semi-quantitative assessment of joint changes including the Kellgren-Lawrence score. The proposed readings are not commercial items.  They are not conventional clinical readings that might be offered by a radiology department to primary care doctors for diagnosis of knee osteoarthritis. Rather, they are research readings that require the collection of a large set of predefined variables from the radiographs that are useful only in the research setting. These readings require structured protocols to maximize the accuracy and reduce sources of error. These readings are unique to research assessments due to the following requirements; assessment of a large set of individual radiographic features, which are not used clinically, readings of grouped images from multiple time points for precise measurement of change, readings of images blinded to chronological order, use of multiple readers to assess same images to increase accuracy and reduce error, identification and adjudication of discrepancies between multiple readers by outside party, precise measurement of joint space width at multiple points across the joint and precise comparisons of change in joint space width from image to image.  

Capabilities Statements will be evaluated based upon the following evaluation criteria: 

1. Adequacy of technical approach to provide reliable readings using well established and accepted methodologies for both quantitative and semi-quantitative assessment of longitudinal x-rays from the OAI.
2. Ability to properly handle, process, store, and disburse x-rays and data.
3. Ability to work cooperatively with the Government to establish clear and well documented policies and procedures for access to x-rays/data.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate a sole source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 to Spyglass Biosecurity, Inc., 1792 Green Street, San Francisco, CA 94123 for the acquistion of Environmental Sample Processor (ESP). This instrument is necessary to collect data through in situ monitoring for harmful algal blooms (HABS) in coastal waters. EPA's program needs and objective require acquisition of real-time measurement of the distribution and concentration of Harmful Algal Bloom (HAB) indicator species, Alexandrium, in coastal waters of the Northeast. These measurements are needed to support timely warning to coastal managers of the occurence of HABs and the probability of risk to human health so that appropriate monitoring and closures can be made.
The US EPA will acquire a Enviromental Sample Processor (ESP) with a DNA probe module specific to organisms that cause Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs). The ESP casing will be competent for in-situ deployment on existing mooring within the Northeast Regional Association of Coastal Observing Systems (NERACOOS). The EPA has identified Spyglass Biosecurity, Inc the only vendor capable of satisfying this requirement. The Monterey Bay Research Institute (MBARI) originated the concept for Environmental Sample Processors (ESP). MBARI has built, tested and deployed the prototype instruments. MBARI granted Spyglass Biosecurity, Inc. an exclusive, worldwide license to develop, manufacture, use and sell MBARI's Environmental Sample Processor Technology. Therefore, Spyglass Biosecurity, Inc. is the only source that can provide the Environmental Sample Processor. MBARI does not produce instruments for sale or commercial use. The circumstance permitting is FAR 6.302-1 "Only one resonsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements". The intent of this notice is to determine if any other source(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation (RFP) is available.
All interested parties who believe they can provide the required services should fully explain their capabilities and qualifications in writing within 15 days from the date of this announcement and provide pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible. Consequently, anyone failing to provide the aforementioned and instead chooses to merely submit a routing letter requesting a copy of the statement of work or more information about the project will be ignored. The information received to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. Please submit response to the U.S. EPA, Attn: Jeffery Clodfelter (MC-E105-02), RTP Procurement Operations Division, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711. No telephone or faxed request will be honored.

<DESC><p>The proposed contact action is for products/service for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, CUBIC Defense Applications, Incorporated under the authority of FAR 13.106. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit quotes. This notice of intent is not a request for quotes. However, all quotes received by 22 July 2009, 10:00 am, MST will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Sole Source is based upon the requirement, Multiple Integrated Laser Emitting Systems (MILES) gear, needed by the Deployment Ready Expedition Training (DREST). The MILES gar is needed to ensure compatibility/continuity of the product used within the existing MILES gear. Purchasing this type of equipment from a different source will render the current gear incompatible, unusable, and would be cost prohibitive to the Government. Based on these facts this gear can only be procured through this one source CUBIC Defense Applications. The information listed below includes a detailed description of the items that are intended to be procured as part of this sole source notice.</p>
<p>Description - KIT, SIM SYS, IWS, M16 A2/M4</p>
<p>Quantity&nbsp;- 42(EA)</p>
<p>SUBJECT: Single/Sole Source Requirement Request, PR # F3L3CA9092A001, MILES Gear Purchase</p>
<p>1. This request is for the purchase of Multiple Integrated Laser Emitting System (MILES) gear as authorized under FAR 13.106-1(b) (1). This single/sole source acquisition is for $100,000.00 or less, and is requested by Mr. Phillip Wickham and Mr. Harvey Kraft for Deployment Ready Expedition Training (DREST). The POC for this requirement&nbsp;is SrA Jared Wiedmer @ 719-556-4285. The facts are as follows:</p>
<p>a. This request is for the purchase of MILES Gear used during DREST classes for deploying personnel. This MILES gear is used as a kit. Each kit consists of three pieces: a transmitter, a body harness receiver and a helmet mounted receiver. The transmitter is mounted on the barrel of an M-16A2 rifle and emits a laser beam each time a round is fired. When the laser is detected by the body harness receiver or the helmet mounted receiver a tone is emitted from the body harness indicating that the person wearing the harness is dead.</p>
<p>b. In this paragraph, identify the authority AF Form 9, F3L3CA9092A001, fund cite&nbsp;-- ESP Code --. Cubic Defense Applications Inc. provided 42 sets of MILES gear in Feb 2009 to meet DREST requirements. This company can provide an additional 42 sets of MILES gear to ensure that the new MILES gear is compatible with the current MILES gear.</p>
<p>c. This "Sole Source" request is needed to ensure the compatibility/continuity of product used within the existing MILES gear. Purchasing this type of equipment from a different source will render the current 42 sets of MILES gear incompatible and unusable.</p>
<p>d. Acquiring the MILES Gear on the open competition could, based on price, necessitate the purchase of a product similar to the existing MILES gear but not compatible with the current MILES gear. This purchase would be cost prohibitive as well as impeding the necessary DREST training.</p>
<p>2. Based on the above information it is my opinion that sole source procurement is accurate and in the best interest of the Government.</p>

<DESC><p>The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) intends to make a sole source award to Kator, Parks, &amp; Weiser P.L.L.C for legal services. PBGC is currently in the midst of an EEO investigation of claim made against PBGC by a PBGC employee. To avoid the possible appearance of a conflict of interest, PBGC has decided to retain outside counsel. To ensure that the interests of PBGC are fully represented, PBGC needs an outside law firm with significant experience and expertise in Federal sector EEO matters, federal personnel law, and a familiarity with the PBGC. Kator, Parks, &amp; Weiser P.L.L.C, through its partners, Jessica Parks and Cathy Harris, is uniquely qualified for this service.
<p>Kator, Parks &amp; Weiser, PLLC is a Washington, D.C. based law firm with a civil practice in employment law, and a special concentration on employment law involving Federal employees. Moreover, they have previously served as outside legal counsel representing PBGC on other personnel and EEO matters. Due to their previous work for PBGC, Ms. Parks and Ms. Harris have a unique knowledge of PBGC operations. In addition, Ms. Parks and Ms. Harris have extensive experience and a proven track record of success appearing before the EEOC. They are willing to provide the services, and are available on short notice. PBGC needs to quickly bring in counsel and brief them on the case to ensure that it is adequately represented regardless of any course of action the complainant may take.</p>
<p>The Contractor, through its partners and associates, will represent PBGC, as needed, before the EEOC and/or in District Court. The representation of PBGC may include, among other things, taking depositions, document review, preparation of legal arguments, drafting a motion for summary judgment, representation at a pre-hearing conference, representation at a hearing before the EEOC, working with an Assistant U.S. Attorney from the Department of Justice, and representation at any settlement discussions.</p>
<p>This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP), but a Notice of Intent. An RFP will not be issued. Interested parties may, however, request further information (no later than 22, July 2009, Eastern Time) by email to Patrick McFarlane at mcfarlane.patrick@pbgc.gov and Mark Miller at miller.mark@pbgc.gov</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY  THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION.  This opportunity is a modification to an existing task order.

This notice is for informational purposes only and is intended to provide notification of the use of funds authorized under the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act of 2009 on this contract.  The United States Department of Agriculture, Farm Service Agency awarded a contract to Electronic Data Systems, LLC on 6/21/2008 for FSA - Database Management Office (DBMO).  The FSA Database Management Office (DBMO) currently supports several hundred databases across FSAs environments.  These databases manage and secure the data for the FSA farm programs, farm loan program, financial, and administrative applications.  As the database technology advances, the databases must be upgraded to leverage the increased performance that is required by the applications that support the FSA Service Center customers and staff.  Highly skilled resources are needed for this effort to ensure that optimum technical decisions are made and implemented.  The migration effort is needed in order to complete the migration objectives while DBMO also supports the existing legacy system databases, so that the other planned activities and schedules of FSA application development projects are not delayed. 
Award of this modification will permit DBMO to continue the database migration effort with contractor staff resources proficient in the business intelligence skill set necessary to support the FSA database migration effort.  Overall, migrating the databases and proactively analyzing the performance metrics will improve the reliability and responsiveness of FSA farm program applications that are delivered to the FSA Service Center customers. This action is to fund a contract modification with Recovery Act funds.
The nature of work sought under this task order modification consists of the following major categories of work functions:
	Support the migration of FSA application databases by providing:
 
	Sufficient, skilled resources for planning, designing and supporting the SQL Server 2005 database upgrade and migration effort.

	Provide a migration plan and a process that is designed and implemented so that it does not adversely impact the delivery of any of the FSA services.

	Provide resources to support the upgrade so that vendor maintenance and technical support will continue.

	Provide resources to support the configuration, tuning, and application of the Database 
Performance Analysis tools that enable the database administrators to proactively maintain the health and performance of the databases.

General Procurement Information 
The task order award is a firm fixed price contract that was awarded competitively.  The project magnitude of the modification is estimated between $900,000 and $1,000,000.  This modification will be effective for the duration of option period one.  The NACIS code is 541511.  The appropriate Treasury Account Symbol is TAS::120599::TAS.

The University of Tennessee Agricultural Experiment Station has the unique capabilities to meet the agency needs because they have worked with Tennessee Wildlife Resources to identify specific lands that can be managed/improved to ensure suitable breeding habitats for breeding season.

<DESC>On a SOLE-SOURCE basis, the Bureau of Transportation Research (BTS), within the Research and Special Programs Administration (RITA), within the U. S. Department of Transportation (DOT), plans to issue, to Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc. (ESRI), a new delivery order or a new purchase order or a Modification to ESRIs existing Delivery Order No. DTOS59-09-F-00036.  That contemplated SOLE-SOURCE action would authorize ESRI to CONTINUEduring the time-period running from approximately August 10th through September 11th, 2009ESRIs ongoing extension, implementation and deployment of the web-based, geo-enabled map viewer previously developed by ESRI for the purpose of showcasing and reporting on the transportation infrastructure projects funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA).  The continued extension, implementation and deployment here envisioned will include data staging and configuration, application tuning, and application enhancement based on user feedback.  

The cost for that needed continuation of extension, implementation and deployment is currently estimated at $48,240but there is a possibility that the work may not be completed by September 11th and that it may need to be further extended, again on a sole-source basis for ESRI, for several months BEYOND September 11th, perhaps resulting in an ultimate cumulative total cost to DOT of up to $500,000 for the subject ESRI sole-source project.  And this Special Notice shall be interpreted, by all readers, as specifically addressing, ENCOMPASSING, and ANNOUNCING that possibility, and as instructing all readers to take that possibility into CONSIDERATION in deciding whether or not to RESPOND to this Special Notice. 

The U. S. Department of Transportation (DOT) makes extensive use of the Geographic Information System (GIS) software suite produced by ESRI and has existing software licenses for the entire suite, including the web mapping extension ArcGIS Server.  The ESRI software, including the ArcGIS Server, is part of the DOTs Enterprise Architecture.  In addition, all of DOTs geospatial data holdings are directly compatible with the ESRI suite of software.  Other web mapping softwares are not part of DOTs Enterprise Architecture and are not directly compatible with the DOT geospatial data.  Under DOTs existing contract numbered DTOS59-09-F-00036 with ESRI, an ArcGIS Server application was developed to showcase and report on the transportation infrastructure projects funded under the ARRA.  In order to take advantage of the latest advances in web mapping technology, the application was developed using the ArcGIS Server 9.3.3 version, which has not yet been shipped to customers or to third-party developers.  The application was well received by DOT Senior Staff, who have indicated their preference for extension, implementation and deployment of the application.  Given the fact that neither USDOTs staff nor any third-party developers have experience with ArcGIS Server 9.3.1 version, ESRI is uniquely qualified to support DOT on the contemplated continued extension, implementation and deployment here under discussion.  ESRI Professional Services staff has unique and extensive experience in the implementation of ESRI products in large enterprise environments such as the DOT Enterprise Architecture.  Given their direct access to ESRI core developers, ESRI Professional Services staff have an in-depth understanding of ESRI product technology, access to the newest software developments, and visibility into future ESRI product directions.  In addition, many of the ESRI Professional Services staff have experience with implementing ESRI product solutions for the USDOT and for many State DOTs across the country.  All of the foregoing facts make ESRIs staff uniquely qualified to continue the work of extending, implementing and deploying the needed ARRA (GIS) web mapping applications at the high level of quality and usability that is indispensable to DOT.


DOT therefore believes that ESRI is the only available source for the contemplated continued extension, implementation and deployment.  HOWEVER, any company or organization OTHER THAN ESRI, which believes that it is capable of providing such services to RITA / BTS at the high level of quality and efficiency that is indispensable to RITA / BTS, may e-mail, to Mr. James Mowery, a Statement of Qualifications, which must be received Mr. Mowery at james.mowery@dot.gov  not later than 4:15 PM Eastern Daylight Time August 3, 2009.  HOWEVER, any company or organization that is contemplating the submission of such a Statement of Qualifications should bear in mind that the company or organization would not ultimately be able to defeat ESRI in a competitive procurement for the needed work without later proving (in a full-blown proposal) that the company or organization is the best buy for RITA / BTS, taking into account not only technical factors and quality factors but also pricing factors and past performance factors.

<DESC>
Sandia National Laboratories, the lead research and development laboratory for the Department of Energys physical security needs, is seeking one or more licensees in the field of micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) testing to develop Sandias long working distance interferometer technology.  Sandia is seeking a company or companies to commercially license the technology described in this posting, and expects the successful company(ies) to engage in a rigorous commercialization effort to further develop the technology and market the resulting products.  Commercial licensees may have the opportunity to request up to an exclusive license to the intellectual properties in a field of use for reasonable compensation to Sandia.  It is expected that the company(ies) that license the technology will promptly incorporate it into a commercial product.  

Depending on the response to this posting, Sandia may require that potential licensees provide information describing their ability to research, design, develop, manufacture, distribute, market, and service fully functional interferometer systems.  

The subject technology is an interferometer that provides enough space between the microscope objective and the MEMS device being measured so the device can be easily operated with temporary test leads.  This allows interferograms of MEMS devices to be aquired without having to package the MEMS devices and can also allow devices on undiced wafers to be operated and evaluated.  Further, interferograms can be aquired from samples in windowed packages or in vacuum or environmental chambers.  Potential licensees may also request access to the associated control software and power electronics.

To express interest in this opportunity, please respond by mail or fax to Jonathan Gardner by 7 August 2009 at: Sandia National Laboratories, MS 0115, P.O. Box 5800, Albuquerque New Mexico 87185-0115, Fax 505-844-8011, E-mail: jgardn@sandia.gov or phone: 505-284-3557.  Please indicate the date and title of the FBO notice.  Include company and contact information, as well as a description of how your company meets Sandias criteria and could best contribute to the commercialization of this technology.  Sandia is a multiprogram laboratory operated by Sandia Corporation, a Lockheed Martin Company, for the United States Department of Energys National Nuclear Security Administration under Contract DE-AC04-94AL85000.

(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers. 
(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.
(2)
(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is late and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and
(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or
(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Governments control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or
(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.
(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.
(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.
(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.
(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers.

(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offerors initial offer should contain the offerors best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge.

(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
(ii) Examples.
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe that the hourly rate payments and material costs that will accrue in performing this contract in the next succeeding 30 days, if added to all other payments and costs previously accrued, will exceed 85 percent of the ceiling price in the Schedule, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer giving a revised estimate of the total price to the Government for performing this contract with supporting reasons and documentation.

(l) Termination for the Governments convenience. The Government reserves the right to terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for its sole convenience. In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall immediately stop all work hereunder and shall immediately cause any and all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid an amount for direct labor hours (as defined in the Schedule of the contract) determined by multiplying the number of direct labor hours expended before the effective date of termination by the hourly rate(s) in the contract, less any hourly rate payments already made to the Contractor plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system that have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractors records.

For line items covered by the WTO GPA, the Government will evaluate offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American Act.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--
(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; 
(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and
(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and
(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
(ii) Examples.
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

(2) [_] Outside the United States.
(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.]
(1) [_] Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [_] does [_] does not certify that
(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations;

(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.
(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies
(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and
(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.
(l) Taxpayer identification number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)
(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
(2) The TIN may be used by the government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offerors relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. 
(2) 
(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business days written notification of its intention to:

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims).

Information provided to the Contractors CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of payment paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.
(End of Clause)
Alternate I (Oct 2008) When a time-and-materials or labor-hour contract is contemplated, substitute the following paragraphs (a), (e), (i) and (l) for those in the basic clause.
(a) Inspection/Acceptance. 
(1) The Government has the right to inspect and test all materials furnished and services performed under this contract, to the extent practicable at all places and times, including the period of performance, and in any event before acceptance. The Government may also inspect the plant or plants of the Contractor or any subcontractor engaged in contract performance. The Government will perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work.
(2) If the Government performs inspection or tests on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish and shall require subcontractors to furnish all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties.
(3) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Government will accept or reject services and materials at the place of delivery as promptly as practicable after delivery, and they will be presumed accepted 60 days after the date of delivery, unless accepted earlier.
(4) At any time during contract performance, but not later than 6 months (or such other time as may be specified in the contract) after acceptance of the services or materials last delivered under this contract, the Government may require the Contractor to replace or correct services or materials that at time of delivery failed to meet contract requirements. Except as otherwise specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this clause, the cost of replacement or correction shall be determined under paragraph (i) of this clause, but the hourly rate for labor hours incurred in the replacement or correction shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit. Unless otherwise specified below, the portion of the hourly rate attributable to profit shall be 10 percent. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance materials and services required to be replaced or corrected without disclosing the former requirement for replacement or correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken. [Insert portion of labor rate attributable to profit.]

(B) Except as provided for in paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(A) and (D)(2) of this clause, the Government will reimburse the Contractor the actual cost of materials (less any rebates, refunds, or discounts received by the contractor that are identifiable to the contract) provided the Contractor

It is estimated that the total cost to the Government for the performance of this contract shall not exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule and the Contractor agrees to use its best efforts to perform the work specified in the Schedule and all obligations under this contract within such ceiling price. If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe that the hourly rate payments and material costs that will accrue in performing this contract in the next succeeding 30 days, if added to all other payments and costs previously accrued, will exceed 85 percent of the ceiling price in the Schedule, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer giving a revised estimate of the total price to the Government for performing this contract with supporting reasons and documentation.

When and to the extent that the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule has been increased, any hours expended and material costs incurred by the Contractor in excess of the ceiling price before the increase shall be allowable to the same extent as if the hours expended and material costs had been incurred after the increase in the ceiling price.
(4) Access to records. At any time before final payment under this contract, the Contracting Officer (or authorized representative) will have access to the following (access shall be limited to the listing below unless otherwise agreed to by the Contractor and the Contracting Officer):
(i) Records that verify that the employees whose time has been included in any invoice met the qualifications for the labor categories specified in the contract.

(C) Affected contract line item or subline item, if applicable; and

(ii) The Government may issue a demand for payment to the Contractor upon finding a debt is due under the contract.
(iii) Final Decisions. The Contracting Officer will issue a final decision as required by 33.211 if
(A) The Contracting Officer and the Contractor are unable to reach agreement on the existence or amount of a debt in a timely manner;
(B) The Contractor fails to liquidate a debt previously demanded by the Contracting Officer within the timeline specified in the demand for payment unless the amounts were not repaid because the Contractor has requested an installment payment agreement; or
(C) The Contractor requests a deferment of collection on a debt previously demanded by the Contracting Officer (see FAR 32.60702).
(iv) If a demand for payment was previously issued for the debt, the demand for payment included in the final decision shall identify the same due date as the original demand for payment.
(v) Amounts shall be due at the earliest of the following dates:
(A) The date fixed under this contract.
(B) The date of the first written demand for payment, including any demand for payment resulting from a default termination.
(vi) The interest charge shall be computed for the actual number of calendar days involved beginning on the due date and ending on
(A) The date on which the designated office receives payment from the Contractor;
(B) The date of issuance of a Government check to the Contractor from which an amount otherwise payable has been withheld as a credit against the contract debt; or
(C) The date on which an amount withheld and applied to the contract debt would otherwise have become payable to the Contractor.

(viii) Upon receipt and approval of the invoice designated by the Contractor as the completion invoice and supporting documentation, and upon compliance by the Contractor with all terms of this contract, any outstanding balances will be paid within 30 days unless the parties agree otherwise. The completion invoice, and supporting documentation, shall be submitted by the Contractor as promptly as practicable following completion of the work under this contract, but in no event later than 1 year (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may approve in writing) from the date of completion.
(7) Release of claims. The Contractor, and each assignee under an assignment entered into under this contract and in effect at the time of final payment under this contract, shall execute and deliver, at the time of and as a condition precedent to final payment under this contract, a release discharging the Government, its officers, agents, and employees of and from all liabilities, obligations, and claims arising out of or under this contract, subject only to the following exceptions.
(i) Specified claims in stated amounts, or in estimated amounts if the amounts are not susceptible to exact statement by the Contractor.
(ii) Claims, together with reasonable incidental expenses, based upon the liabilities of the Contractor to third parties arising out of performing this contract, that are not known to the Contractor on the date of the execution of the release, and of which the Contractor gives notice in writing to the Contracting Officer not more than 6 years after the date of the release or the date of any notice to the Contractor that the Government is prepared to make final payment, whichever is earlier.
(iii) Claims for reimbursement of costs (other than expenses of the Contractor by reason of its indemnification of the Government against patent liability), including reasonable incidental expenses, incurred by the Contractor under the terms of this contract relating to patents.
(8) Prompt payment. The Government will make payment in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C 3903) and prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR part 1315.
(9) Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT). If the Government makes payment by EFT, see 52.212-5(b) for the appropriate EFT clause.
(10) Discount. In connection with any discount offered for early payment, time shall be computed from the date of the invoice. For the purpose of computing the discount earned, payment shall be considered to have been made on the date that appears on the payment check or the specified payment date if an electronic funds transfer payment is made.
(l) Termination for the Governments convenience. The Government reserves the right to terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for its sole convenience. In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall immediately stop all work hereunder and shall immediately cause any and all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid an amount for direct labor hours (as defined in the Schedule of the contract) determined by multiplying the number of direct labor hours expended before the effective date of termination by the hourly rate(s) in the contract, less any hourly rate payments already made to the Contractor plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system that have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractors records. The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred that reasonably could have been avoided

(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
(ii) Examples.
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. 
(2) 
(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business days written notification of its intention to:
(A) Change the name in the CCR database;

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractors CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of payment paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.
(End of Clause)

(a) Inspection/Acceptance. 
(1) The Government has the right to inspect and test all materials furnished and services performed under this contract, to the extent practicable at all places and times, including the period of performance, and in any event before acceptance. The Government may also inspect the plant or plants of the Contractor or any subcontractor engaged in contract performance. The Government will perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work.
(2) If the Government performs inspection or tests on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish and shall require subcontractors to furnish all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties.
(3) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Government will accept or reject services and materials at the place of delivery as promptly as practicable after delivery, and they will be presumed accepted 60 days after the date of delivery, unless accepted earlier.
(4) At any time during contract performance, but not later than 6 months (or such other time as may be specified in the contract) after acceptance of the services or materials last delivered under this contract, the Government may require the Contractor to replace or correct services or materials that at time of delivery failed to meet contract requirements. Except as otherwise specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this clause, the cost of replacement or correction shall be determined under paragraph (i) of this clause, but the hourly rate for labor hours incurred in the replacement or correction shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit. Unless otherwise specified below, the portion of the hourly rate attributable to profit shall be 10 percent. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance materials and services required to be replaced or corrected without disclosing the former requirement for replacement or correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken. [Insert portion of labor rate attributable to profit.]
(5) 
(i) If the Contractor fails to proceed with reasonable promptness to perform required replacement or correction, and if the replacement or correction can be performed within the ceiling price (or the ceiling price as increased by the Government), the Government may
(A) By contract or otherwise, perform the replacement or correction, charge to the Contractor any increased cost, or deduct such increased cost from any amounts paid or due under this contract; or
(B) Terminate this contract for cause.
(ii) Failure to agree to the amount of increased cost to be charged to the Contractor shall be a dispute under the Disputes clause of the contract.
(6) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) above, the Government may at any time require the Contractor to remedy by correction or replacement, without cost to the Government, any failure by the Contractor to comply with the requirements of this contract, if the failure is due to--
(i) Fraud, lack of good faith, or willful misconduct on the part of the Contractors managerial personnel; or
(ii) The conduct of one or more of the Contractors employees selected or retained by the Contractor after any of the Contractors managerial personnel has reasonable grounds to believe that the employee is habitually careless or unqualified.
(7) This clause applies in the same manner and to the same extent to corrected or replacement materials or services as to materials and services originally delivered under this contract.
(8) The Contractor has no obligation or liability under this contract to correct or replace materials and services that at time of delivery do not meet contract requirements, except as provided in this clause or as may be otherwise specified in the contract.
(9) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Contractors obligation to correct or replace Government-furnished property shall be governed by the clause pertaining to Government property.

(iii) Materials means
(A) Direct materials, including supplies transferred between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of the contractor under a common control;

(i) Payments.
(1) Services accepted. Payments shall be made for services accepted by the Government that have been delivered to the delivery destination(s) set forth in this contract. The Government will pay the Contractor as follows upon the submission of commercial invoices approved by the Contracting Officer:
(i) Hourly rate.
(A) The amounts shall be computed by multiplying the appropriate hourly rates prescribed in the contract by the number of direct labor hours performed. Fractional parts of an hour shall be payable on a prorated basis.
(B) The rates shall be paid for all labor performed on the contract that meets the labor qualifications specified in the contract. Labor hours incurred to perform tasks for which labor qualifications were specified in the contract will not be paid to the extent the work is performed by individuals that do not meet the qualifications specified in the contract, unless specifically authorized by the Contracting Officer.
(C) Invoices may be submitted once each month (or at more frequent intervals, if approved by the Contracting Officer) to the Contracting Officer or the authorized representative.
(D) When requested by the Contracting Officer or the authorized representative, the Contractor shall substantiate invoices (including any subcontractor hours reimbursed at the hourly rate in the schedule) by evidence of actual payment, individual daily job timecards, records that verify the employees meet the qualification s for the labor categories specified in the contract, or other substantiation specified in the contract.
(E) Unless the Schedule prescribes otherwise, the hourly rates in the Schedule shall not be varied by virtue of the Contractor having performed work on an overtime basis.
(1) If no overtime rates are provided in the Schedule and the Contracting Officer approves overtime work in advance, overtime rates shall be negotiated.
(2) Failure to agree upon these overtime rates shall be treated as a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract.
(3) If the Schedule provided rates for overtime, the premium portion of those rates will be reimbursable only to the extent the overtime is approved by the Contracting Officer.
(ii) Materials.
(A) If the Contractor furnishes materials that meet the definition of a commercial item at FAR 2.101, the price to be paid for such materials shall be the contractors established catalog or market price, adjusted to reflect the--
(1) Quantities being acquired; and
(2) Any modifications necessary because of contract requirements.
(B) Except as provided for in paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(A) and (D)(2) of this clause, the Government will reimburse the Contractor the actual cost of materials (less any rebates, refunds, or discounts received by the contractor that are identifiable to the contract) provided the Contractor
(1) Has made payments for materials in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice; or

(2) Indirect Costs (Material handling, Subcontract Administration, etc.). The Government will reimburse the Contractor for indirect costs on a pro-rata basis over the period of contract performance at the following fixed price: [Insert a fixed amount for the indirect costs and payment schedule. Insert $0 if no fixed price reimbursement for indirect costs will be provided. (If this is an indefinite delivery contract, the Contracting Officer may insert Each order must list separately the fixed amount for the indirect costs and payment schedule or, if no reimbursement for indirect costs, insert None.]
(2) Total cost. It is estimated that the total cost to the Government for the performance of this contract shall not exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule and the Contractor agrees to use its best efforts to perform the work specified in the Schedule and all obligations under this contract within such ceiling price. If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe that the hourly rate payments and material costs that will accrue in performing this contract in the next succeeding 30 days, if added to all other payments and costs previously accrued, will exceed 85 percent of the ceiling price in the Schedule, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer giving a revised estimate of the total price to the Government for performing this contract with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during the performance of this contract, the Contractor has reason to believe that the total price to the Government for performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the then stated ceiling price, the Contractor shall so notify the Contracting Officer, giving a revised estimate of the total price for performing this contract, with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during performance of this contract, the Government has reason to believe that the work to be required in performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the stated ceiling price, the Contracting Officer will so advise the Contractor, giving the then revised estimate of the total amount of effort to be required under the contract.

When and to the extent that the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule has been increased, any hours expended and material costs incurred by the Contractor in excess of the ceiling price before the increase shall be allowable to the same extent as if the hours expended and material costs had been incurred after the increase in the ceiling price.

(i) Records that verify that the employees whose time has been included in any invoice met the qualifications for the labor categories specified in the contract.

(B) The Contractors timekeeping procedures;
(C) Contractor records that show the distribution of labor between jobs or contracts; and
(D) Employees whose time has been included in any invoice for the purpose of verifying that these employees have worked the hours shown on the invoices.

(B) Affected contract number and delivery order number, if applicable;
(C) Affected contract line item or subline item, if applicable; and
(D) Contractor point of contact.
(ii) Provide a copy of the remittance and supporting documentation to the Contracting Officer.
(6) 
(i) All amounts that become payable by the Contractor to the Government under this contract shall bear simple interest from the date due until paid unless paid within 30 days of becoming due.

(viii) Upon receipt and approval of the invoice designated by the Contractor as the completion invoice and supporting documentation, and upon compliance by the Contractor with all terms of this contract, any outstanding balances will be paid within 30 days unless the parties agree otherwise. The completion invoice, and supporting documentation, shall be submitted by the Contractor as promptly as practicable following completion of the work under this contract, but in no event later than 1 year (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may approve in writing) from the date of completion.
(7) Release of claims.

(i) Specified claims in stated amounts, or in estimated amounts if the amounts are not susceptible to exact statement by the Contractor.

(l) Termination for the Governments convenience. The Government reserves the right to terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for its sole convenience. In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall immediately stop all work hereunder and shall immediately cause any and all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid an amount for direct labor hours (as defined in the Schedule of the contract) determined by multiplying the number of direct labor hours expended before the effective date of termination by the hourly rate(s) in the contract, less any hourly rate payments already made to the Contractor plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system that have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose.

<SOLNBR>SB1341-09-RQ-0422
<RESPDATE>073109
<CONTACT>Charles Koehler, Email charles.koehler@nist.gov
<DESC><p>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL<br />ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION<br />FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.&nbsp;
<p>This solicitation is being issued using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.</p>
<p>This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-34.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334513 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.</p>
<p>The NIST Machine Tool Metrology Group requires an upgrade of the existing and outdated Renishaw ML-10 laser measurement system. The current ML-10 no longer meets the requirements for high-accuracy, state-of-the-art measurements. In addition, technical support and maintenance for the ML-10 system are no longer available from the manufacturer.</p>
<p>NIST staff has invested substantial time and resources to establish a machine tool measurement capability based on the existing ML-10 system, including development and implementation of critical hardware and software components used in the laboratory. NIST requires the replacement laser measurement system be fully compatible with these existing hardware and software components (including data files, mounting tripod, steering optics, other Renishaw optical components, etc.) to have an integrated system. This compatibility is necessary to maintain project efficiency, ensure interoperability, prevent the need for substantial re-development, reduce training requirements and minimize cost to the Government. The Renishaw XL-80 laser measurement system is the only available system that meets the Government needs for full compatibility with existing components because the technology is proprietary to Renishaw.</p>
<p>This is a BRAND NAME ONLY requirement. Only the brand name identified shall be accepted. All equipment must be new. Equipment that is used or refurbished shall not be considered for award.</p>
<p>All interested Contractors shall provide a quotation for the following:</p>
<p>Line Item 0001: Quantity one (1) each Renishaw XL-80 Laser Measurement System Upgrade Kit, Renishaw Part Number SYS-XL-UPG, of which includes all of the following. Installation and training are not required.</p>
<p>A. Quantity One (1) Each Renishaw XL-80 Laser Head, Part #A-9908-0405;<br />B. Quantity One (1) Each Renishaw XC-80 Environmental Compensation Unit, Part #A-9908-0510;<br />C. Quantity One (1) Each Renishaw Laser XL Software, Part #A-9908-0301;<br />D. Quantity One (1) Each Renishaw Software Support Disc, Part #A-9908-0303;<br />E. Quantity One (1) Each Renishaw XL Tripod Stage Kit, Part #A-9908-0700;<br />F. Quantity One (1) Each Renishaw Full System Case, Part #A-9908-0314; and<br />G. Quantity One (1) Each Renishaw ML-XL Tripod Adapter, Part #A-9908-0765.</p>
<p>The Government has the following equipment available for trade-in credit. The Government will consider any trade-in credit proposed by the Contractor when evaluating the proposed price. The Contractor shall be responsible for removal of all equipment they agree to accept for trade-in credit. Removal of equipment shall be scheduled, in advance, with the NIST technical contact to be identified at the time of award.</p>
<p>A. Quantity One (1) Each Renishaw ML-10 Laser Head, Model Number ML-10, Serial Number G18190, NIST Number 560984, in fully-functional condition;<br />B.

It includes all types of commitments that obligate the Government to an expenditure of appropriated funds and that, except as otherwise authorized, are in writing. In addition to bilateral instruments, contracts include (but are not limited to) awards and notices of awards; job orders or task letters issued under basic ordering agreements; letter contracts; orders, such as purchase orders, under which the contract becomes effective by written acceptance or performance; and bilateral contract modifications. Contracts do not include grants and cooperative agreements covered by 31 U.S.C. 6301, et seq. For discussion of various types of contracts, see FAR Part 16. 
First-tier subcontract means a subcontract awarded directly by a Federal Government prime contractor whose contract is funded by the Recovery Act. 
Jobs created means an estimate of those new positions created and filled, or previously existing unfilled positions that are filled, as a result of funding by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act). This definition covers only prime contractor positions established in the United States and outlying areas (see definition in FAR 2.101). The number shall be expressed as full-time equivalent (FTE), calculated cumulatively as all hours worked divided by the total number of hours in a full-time schedule, as defined by the contractor. For instance, two full-time employees and one part-time employee working half days would be reported as 2.5 FTE in each calendar quarter. 
Jobs retained means an estimate of those previously existing filled positions that are retained as a result of funding by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act). This definition covers only prime contractor positions established in the United States and outlying areas (see definition in FAR 2.101). The number shall be expressed as full-time equivalent (FTE), calculated cumulatively as all hours worked divided by the total number of hours in a full-time schedule, as defined by the contractor. For instance, two full-time employees and one part-time employee working half days would be reported as 2.5 FTE in each calendar quarter. 
Total compensation means the cash and noncash dollar value earned by the executive during the contractors past fiscal year of the following (for more information see 17 CFR 229.402(c)(2)):

(3) Earnings for services under non-equity incentive plans. Does not include group life, health, hospitalization or medical reimbursement plans that do not discriminate in favor of executives, and are available generally to all salaried employees. 
(4) Change in pension value. This is the change in present value of defined benefit and actuarial pension plans. 
(5) Above-market earnings on deferred compensation which is not tax-qualified.

BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION:

The items required by this solicitation shall be Cisco SMARTnet brand.   NIST Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) requires Cisco SMARTnet brand maintenance because Cisco SMARTnet maintenance is the only hardware/software support package that is currently available for NIST Cisco devices.

The NIST OCIO provides a complex environment of networks, servers, and applications. The NIST OCIO requires the access to the Cisco.com knowledgebase and tools and the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) with direct access to Cisco engineers to help troubleshoot critical problems that arise due to the complex environment. Only SMARTnet maintenance customers have direct access to Cisco engineers and can escalate problems to Cisco developers. Access to the Cisco TAC is only available to Cisco SMARTnet service contract customers or those who pay a per-incident fee. 

In addition, the NIST OCIO requires the ability to obtain Cisco Operating System (OS) software updates for licensed feature sets for all current production devices at the NIST Gaithersburg, Maryland campus.  OS software updates include bug fixes and maintenance as well as minor and major releases within a feature set. Only devices that remain under Cisco SMARTnet maintenance coverage can be updated.  If the NIST OCIO does not have Cisco SMARTnet maintenance coverage, NIST would be required to pay an additional fee for all 500+ devices each time a required update was needed.

Furthermore, due to the critical nature of the NIST network equipment, the NIST OCIO requires that any failed Cisco device must be replaced with a new version of the same Cisco model or a newer Cisco model.  All Cisco software licenses are to end-user purchasers and are non-transferable. Only Cisco SMARTnet authorized vendors sell the required Cisco SMARTnet maintenance to enable the NIST OCIO to ensure that its Cisco licenses are maintained. 

In order to purchase Cisco SMARTnet maintenance service, Cisco devices must be at the current revision of the software and the device must be inspected by Cisco to make sure all components and the software are approved; otherwise, additional fees may be levied by Cisco.  Cisco SMARTNet is the only brand that includes this capability.  Since NIST OCIO has historically acquired SMARTnet maintenance services for its vast deployment of Cisco devices, there would not be additional fees for applying for Cisco SMARTnet maintenance now nor in the future to ensure the devices are up to date with the required Cisco software revisions and inspections.  If NIST OCIO were to procure any other brand of CISCO maintenance besides SMARTnet which do not offer the certification services that SMARTNet does, these fees would be implemented, adding additional costs to NIST for any future SMARTNet requirements.

BACKGROUND

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) was created by Congress on December 29, 2000, through Public Law 106-58.  The mission of the NIBIB is to improve health by promoting fundamental discoveries, design and development, and translation and assessment of technological capabilities in biomedical imaging and bioengineering, enabled by relevant areas of information science, physics, chemistry, mathematics, materials science, and computer sciences.  The Institute coordinates with biomedical imaging and bioengineering programs of other agencies and NIH institutes to support imaging and engineering research with potential medical applications and facilitates the transfer of such technologies to medical applications.   Interdisciplinary and team science approaches to research have been shown to speed the transformation of basic research results to clinical application for improvement of the public health.


SCOPE OF THE WORK

The Contractor will design, develop, and launch the internet based network for patient-controlled medical image sharing in this pilot project. The Contractor will develop and implement an efficient project management process that ensures a high-quality technical performance. The Contractor shall provide all technical documents of the design and source code of the internet based network for image sharing to the Government.

The Contractor shall provide progress reports on a timely basis as scheduled.

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

This pilot project shall establish several regional image-sharing networks where care sites would be linked through shared access to a patient-centered, Web-based personal health record system.  Each regional network will maintain knowledge of the exams made available by each participating radiology center (hospitals, imaging centers, etc.). This pilot project shall refine the distribution and access model of IHE to ensure that the display and possible import of imaging exams into foreign systems is an intuitive easy process. Sharing image data, along with electronic health records (EHRs), through a network for image exchange will lead to better informed medical decisions, better analysis of medical outcomes, reductions in unnecessary expenses, and improvements in the quality and safety of patient care, as well as biomedical research. The value of patient care will greatly enhance when systems at different locations are capable of managing, exchanging, and displaying medical information in its many forms, including images. 

At least five regional networks shall be enlisted to participate in the patient data sharing project. For research image sharing, eight additional institutions shall be identified. These institutions shall have significant experience with image exchange, and shall be currently exchanging research images for several research projects (each with its own image exchange   mechanism). 


The work shall be done using IHE global patient registry for a patient controlled image sharing. The contractor shall develop an internet based network for image exchange built upon Integrating Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) and Cross Document Sharing profile (XDS). 

The Contractor Shall: 

1.    The Contractor must demonstrate the ability to include extremely broad expertise in project development and review.  This is defined as including a large number of professional societies of technical professions such as imagers, physical scientists, engineers and informatics specialists and a large number of industries that provide multiple imaging modalities, engineering firms, and academic institutions.  The short time frame allowed for this pilot project mandates the ability to include all professional segments of imaging-related sciences in order to quickly build consensus at each step of the development process.

2.  The Contractor must perform the required work using IHE global patient registry for a patient controlled image sharing. The Contractor must perform the required project  as stated in the statement of work, SOW,  an internet based network for image exchange built upon the Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) Cross Document Sharing profile (XDS). 

Offerors must demonstrate that they have done preliminary work using 1) Patient Identifier Cross-reference (PIX) and Patient Demographics Query (PDQ); 2) IHE Cross Document Sharing profile (XDS); 3) MIRC software; and 4) IHE teaching file and Teaching File and Clinical Trial Export (TCE), to test the technical feasibility to connect patient records and access images that have been acquired in multiple healthcare institutes and with multiple vendor systems.

Performance-Period Requirements. 
a.	Period of Performance/Basis.  The period of performance is for 
Twenty-four months or two calendar years from date of award; with no option years.
.  

Reporting Requirements and Deliverables
b.	Reporting Requirements and Deliverables.   In fulfillment of this effort, the Contractor shall provide the following deliverables: 
1)	Annual mid-point report; annual report, as detailed in the SOW, and a project final report.  All deliverables shall be submitted by electronic mail to the Project Officer and Contracting Officer, unless otherwise agreed upon. 
2)	In each case, the subject line of the email should refer to the Internet-Based Network for Patient-Controlled Medical Image Sharing and the contract number of this award. 
3)  Unless otherwise specified, the Government will have a maximum of (10) working days from the day the draft deliverable is received to review the document, provide comments back to the contractor, and to approve or disapprove the deliverable(s).
  4)The contractor will also have a maximum of ten (10) working days from the day comments are received to incorporate all changes and submit the final deliverable to the Government. 
5)  All days are intended to be workdays unless otherwise specified.  

(5)	Trade-offs.  This project is inherently science based, and the speed with which technology is advancing makes it imperative that such a network be designed, agreed upon and launched with the utmost speed.  
In addition, this is very technical work suitable for contracting out and it does not meet the A-76 definition of inherently governmental work.
  The professional staff and associations that shall collaborate in the project will produce a far richer and more valuable product than a single entity could.  This project pulls the radiological community together to develop a powerful tool for its own use and benefit.

Security of Government Facilities, Information, and Information Systems. 
(a)	Homeland Security Presidential Directive/HSPD-12. This acquisition is not subject to HSPD-12, except that contractor personnel who frequently visit NIH facilities for this project may be required to obtain an NIH Identification Badge.

<DESC><p>The U.S. Department of Commerce, Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (FKNMS) in Key West Florida, intends to award a contract for base period plus (4) four option years to develop and implement an Early Warning System to predict the onset of mass coral bleaching in the Florida Keys.. Coral bleaching is a stress condition in reef corals that involves a breakdown of the symbiotic relationship between corals and unicellular algae (zooxanthellae). These microscopic plants live within the coral tissue and provide the coral with food for growth and their normal healthy color. Affecting corals during the warm summer months, the symptoms of bleaching include a gradual loss of color as their algae are expelled from the coral tissue, sometimes leaving corals bone white. This information from the Early Warning System will allow managers to better assess, communication, and respond to mass bleaching events. The Early Warning System will consist of three elements designed to detect each of these stages: climate monitoring, sea temperature monitoring, and volunteer observations. Minimum Requirements: Demonstrated experience managing volunteer monitoring programs in collecting observations on extreme events in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary<br />Knowledge of the Florida Keys coral reef ecosystem. Knowledge of the existing relevant research in the Florida Keys. Demonstrate scientific expertise for data synthesis and interpretation relevant to coral bleaching or other episodic events. Familiarity with appropriate environmental data sets and the individuals and organizations that collect these data sets. NAICS code is 541990. Business size standard is $7.0M. Any small business capable of providing this service is encouraged to respond to this announcement within 15 calendar days after publication of this notice. This support service is being procured under the guidelines of FAR Part 12, Commercial Items Procedures. The solicitation can be uploaded from this website. Interested parties can request a copy of the Request for Quotation on or about July 21, 2009. Potential vendors are encouraged to return to this site to obtain the Request for Quotation. Faxed requests can be sent to 816-274-6983, Attn: Sharon Walker. The government requires that all contractors doing business with the government must be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR). For additional information and to register in CCR please access the following website: http://www.ccr.gov/. In order to register with the CCR and to be eligible to receive an award from this acquisition office, all offerors must have a Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number.

<p>(IV) This solicitation is total small business set aside. The associated NAICS code is 334516. The small business size standard is 500.</p>
<p>(V) This combined solicitation/synopsis is for purchase of the following commercial item(s)/services:</p>
<p>CLIN NO. 0001 -Instrumentation capable of ambient atmospheric measurements from pressurized research aircraft, measuring CO2 and measuring CH4, both measurements meeting the technical specifications outlined below. Quantity: 1.</p>
<p>Market Research indicates that one instrument is capable of doing both measurements (CO2 and CH4) or separate instruments can be purchased, one measuring CO2 and one measuring CH4. The government does not have a preference and will purchase the overall best value.</p>
<p>(VI) Description of requirements is as follows: <br />Specifications:<br />Precise, accurate, and reliable airborne instrumentation for measuring atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) is necessary to better understand the sources, sinks, and distributions of these gases, the effects of anthropogenic activities on these quantities, and how these contribute to multiple air quality and climate-relevant issues facing the Nation. ESRL CSD has an immediate need for laser spectrometers for CO2 and CO4 measurements aboard the NOAA WP-3D pressurized research aircraft for use in the upcoming CalNex field project in May and June of 2010. <br />The instrument(s) must have a demonstrated capability of 1 Hz (or faster) true time response to atmospheric variability. The true time response criterion is defined as the time, after a step change in mixing ratio, for the instrument(s) to quantify 99% of the step change, e.g., equivalent to a single exponential response time of 4.605 Hz or faster. The instrument(s) must be able to measure within a pressurized research aircraft operating in the altitude range from sea level to 25,000 feet, with a 1-sigma at 1-Hz minimum demonstrated precision of 0.2 ppmv (for CO2) and 1 ppbv (for CH4). They must be inherently linear in response to CO2 and CH4 throughout the atmospherically relevant range of mixing ratios.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. 
     It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 
     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 
     Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
    Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

D) Full IBM warranties will be provided and none of these products will have a negative impact on the warranties of associated system components.<BR><BR>The Department of State, Bureau of Public Affairs (PA) proposes to acquire Hewlett Packard equipment.   This equipment will augment the Bureaus existing technical platform. 
Rationale for HP brand name: In a large computer network, diversity of brands and models severely drives up total cost of ownership (TCO)	Staff must be trained on procedures specific to each brand of workstations	Operating system images must be created, tested, and updated for each brand of PC on the network because images contain the hardware drivers required for the operating system to function with that particular brand of PC. Maintaining multiple brand images duplicates administrators workload, driving up TCO.	When manufacturer support is required to repair any hardware, all support calls go to the same place for any system. 	All equipment comes with a 3 year warranty, preventing technical obsolescence and keeping support costs down by always having equipment covered by manufacturers warranty.	Using non HP products could potentially void the warranty.
PA has a significant prior investment in HP servers. The goal of PA/EX/IT is to consolidate the network servers, desktops, laptops etc. to a cohesive configuration, making administration and support more efficient and thorough. This will result in less user downtime and the best possible contribution to the Departments mission and goals.<BR><BR>

<DESC>RESPONSE DATE HAS BEEN EXTENDED TO JULY 21, 2009 AT 4:30PM EST.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, streamlined procedures for evaluation and solicitation for commercial items-as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested, and a written solicitation document will not be issued.  This solicitation is being issued using simplified acquisition procedures 13.5.

This solicitation is a Request for Quotations (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporation provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-32.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will be not issued.  The associated North American Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 621511.  This procurement will be full and open competition. 

The purpose of this contract is to develop and test a platform that can perform real-time PCR on a nucleic acid sample extracted from blood testing for the presence of 10 or more pathogens simultaneously in a volume less than 25ul.  The platform must be optimized to achieve the greatest degree of sensitivity possible while achieving the highest possible level of multiplicity.  This will be a labor hour contract for one year.

Background:

Nucleic acid detection of pathogens in blood products to increase the safety of transfusion has proven to be the most sensitive and efficient method.  However, with the number of pathogens recommended by the FDA for testing and the constant threat of newly emerging pathogens, the number of individual tests performed on each product unit is becoming burdensome and delays the process of fresh blood products reaching the patients in urgent need.  To solve this problem, multiplex Nucleic Acid Tests (NATs) have been developed.  To date the highest number of pathogens that can be assayed in one multiplex test licensed for blood screening is three, HIV, HCV and HBV.  New technology must be developed that can achieve higher levels of multiplicity.

Scope of Work:

NAT assays targeted to specific blood borne pathogens are comprised of oligonucleotide primer pairs and a set of reaction conditions that have been optimized to give the most efficient amplification of the target.  Such NAT assays have been developed by scientists in the Division of Emerging and Transfusion Transmitted Diseases for at least ten different blood borne pathogens individually.  

The contractor will take these primer pairs and associated reaction conditions and combine them into a Nanoscale Multiplex platform that can perform real-time PCR with at least 10 reactions simultaneously.  The platform will also incorporate internal standards to provide quantitative and QA/QC for each test.  

The FDA investigators will provide nucleic acid samples extracted from the various pathogens as well as nucleic acid extracted from blood samples that have been spiked with pathogens.  The contractor will use these samples to evaluate and optimize the performance of the Nanoscale Multiplex platform.  The contractor will report the data on limits of detection of each pathogen when assayed on the Nanoscale Multiplex platform.

The Contractor will perform these tasks:

Task 1.0	Meet with the project officer and develop study design.

Subtask 1.1	The Contractor shall meet with the Government Project Officer (PO) within two weeks after the date of award to discuss the study design and requirements.  The study design described in the proposal will be reviewed at this meeting.
Subtask 1.2	The contractor shall prepare and submit a summary report of the meeting not later than seven (7) days after the meeting.
Task 2.0	Receive blood pathogen oligonucleotide primers and reaction conditions for individual pathogen detection NAT assays
Subtask 2.1	Accept delivery of blood pathogen primers, notify sender of receipt, store properly
Task 3.0	Assemble Nanoscale Multiplex PCR processing devices with blood pathogen primer sets
Subtask 3.1	Load individual primer pairs into nanoscale reaction chambers in multi-chamber array
Subtask 3.2	Store arrays for subsequent sample processing
Task 4.0	Receive and store nucleic acid samples from cultured pathogens
Task 5.0	Optimize detection with pathogen nucleic acid
Subtask 5.1	Demonstrate detection is possible
Subtask 5.2	Determine lower limit of analytical sensitivity for pathogen nucleic acid

<DESC><p>Solicitation Number: FDA1058842
<p>Response Date: 22 July 2009</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES 13.5.</p>
<p>This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-33.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541690 for a 100% small business set-aside.</p>
<p>The FDA intends to issue a firm fixed-price purchase order for the following technical assistance.</p>
<p>I. Background<br />Food and Drug Administration's Pharmaceutical Quality Initiative for the 21st Century was introduced in 2002 to enhance and modernize the regulation of pharmaceutical manufacturing and product quality - to bring a 21st century focus to this critical FDA responsibility. The initiative is intended to modernize FDA's regulation of pharmaceutical quality for veterinary and human drugs and select human biological products (e.g., vaccines). Two of the main tenets of the initiative were to ensure that regulatory review, compliance, and inspection policies are based on state-of-the-art pharmaceutical science and to enhance the consistency and coordination of the overall FDA drug quality regulatory programs.<br />As a result of the diligent work done under the Quality Initiative, the FDA has completed its assessment of the existing quality programs. We assessed current practices as well as available new tools of enhancing manufacturing science. Our assessment helped us create a new framework for the regulatory oversight of manufacturing quality that is based on quality systems and risk management approaches. Our findings have put the Agency on a path to restructure its oversight of pharmaceutical quality regulation, thereby developing the product quality regulatory system of the future.</p>
<p>The three parts of the drug quality regulatory programs - review, compliance, and inspection have basically worked independent of each other over the years. However, in order to successfully implement all of the tenets of the Quality Initiative, it is necessary to develop more coordinated interactions between the three areas. In order to do this, the roles and responsibilities of each separate section must be defined and more specific processes must be implemented, most specifically to enhance communication between the sections.<br />Recently an evaluation was performed to determine roles and responsibilities of review, compliance, and inspection under the new regulatory paradigm and to recommend appropriate processes to ensure effective interaction and communication. That recent assessment of the product quality review process among the relevant FDA business units found a lack of clear roles and responsibilities and lack of clear and cohesive process steps for ensuring product quality.</p>
<p>The work conducted under this contract will be a continuation of the previous assessment task and will focus on following up on the recommendations to develop a seamless process between the various business units involved in product quality review, compliance, and inspections with a focus on documenting roles and responsibilities at each stage of the process.</p>
<p>II. Purpose and Objective<br />The purpose of this effort will be to develop a quality management system for drug product quality review and will involve:</p>
<p>1) Characterizing the Desired State for Review, Compliance &amp; Inspection in the 21st century<br />2) Developing Multiple Examples (at least 3) to Clarify Desired State Relative to Current State<br />3) Assessing Capabilities &amp; Skills of Existing Staff and Identify Opportunities for Development<br />4) Providing SME Consulting to FDA Leadership to Enable Desired State<br />5) Providing On-Going Monitoring Support to Process Consulting and SOP Development Effort<br />During Course of Pilot</p>
<p>III. Description of Deliverables<br />The deliverables for this project include:<br />1) Documenting a characterization of the desired state for the FDA's product quality review business process;<br />2) Assessing the capabilities and skill sets of the existing staff who conduct compliance reviews;<br />3) Developing example scenarios to be used during a pilot to test the new standard operating procedures; and<br />4) Providing subject matter expertise and ongoing consulting support.</p>
<p>IV. Period of Performance<br />Vendor shall provide monthly status reports of progress and shall provide a final recommendation to Center management within 12-months of initiation of contract.</p>
<p>V. Release of Information by Contractor<br />The contractor shall not release any data generated by the study conducted under this project without the approval of the Project Officer.</p>
<p>VI. Site Visits<br />Visits may be required to interview staff in FDA's Office of Pharmaceutical Science and Office of Compliance and to give presentations to Center leadership.</p>
<p>VII. Statement of Work<br />1.

<DESC>NIH is in the process of evaluating its human research protection program (HRPP) using standards established by the Association for the Accreditation of Human Research Protection Programs (AAHRPP). This organization is the recognized world leader in evaluating and accrediting HRPPs. NIHs goal is to obtain full accreditation from AAHRPP by 2010.

Achieving this goal requires an evaluation of current human subjects protection policies and practices to determine if NIH policies meet accreditation standards, if modifications are needed, or, if additional policies must be created.  The policies include standard operating procedures for the NIH IRBs, the NIH Manual Chapter for the NIH HRPP, MAS policies, OHSR Information sheets, memos, delegations of authority, and possibly the Intramural Research Program Conflict of Interest policy (COI).  This evaluation will be used for the accreditation process, as well as administrative management assessment of the HRPP. 

This evaluation process is a trans-NIH initiative involving the NIH Office of Human Subjects Research (OHSR); NIH institutes and centers with clinical programs (Clinical Directors, Principal Investigators) to include the: Deputy Director for Intramural Research, Human Subjects Research Advisory Committee, the 12 NIH IRBs, the Clinical Center, Medical Executive Board, as well as committees established specifically for the purpose of AAHRPP accreditation activities. All of these organizational units/scientists are stakeholders in the evaluation process. 

NIH requires expertise and additional personnel support in this work. The final product of this evaluation will be an NIH application for AAHRPP accreditation that clearly states the policies and procedures of the NIH for human subjects research and meets the standards set by AAHRPP for accreditation. This work product will include any new policies and procedures that are developed during the evaluation. An additional work product will be findings and recommendations for strategic management planning for the NIH HRPP.

The most significant deliverable will be an NIH Application for AAHRPP Accreditation, consistent with regulatory requirements, NIH policies, and AAHRP standards.  However this work involves significant evaluation activities in order to prepare such an application.  The evaluation will collect and analyze data from document reviews of policies and procedures of the HRPP, IRBs, OHSR, the ICs clinical programs, Medical Administrative Service (MAS), and the Medical Executive Committee (MEC).  OHSR will work with the various units to modify current policies and procedures or establish new policies and procedures to obtain accreditation and maintain the high standards of the NIH HRPP. All work under this SOW will be monitored by the Project Officer.

The Office of Human Subject Research (OHSR) NIH proposes to select a vendor in accordance with the procedures for acquiring commercial items authorized in FAR Part 12. 
This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-26 and local clauses of the Department of Health and Human Services and the National Institutes of Health.

<DESC><p>The National Marine Fisheries Service in Boqueron, PR intends to establish a purchase order to produce a creation of a Caribbean Reef Etiquette video. The purpose of this requirment is to increase public awareness regarding the importance of the marine ecosystem and laws and regulations protecting corals and other organisms, dead or alive, in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI). Public awareness regarding the impact of illegal souvenir collection, as well as careless actions while participating in marine recreational activities such as snorkeling, on the coral reef ecosystem is lacking. NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service (NOAA Fisheries) has been working with the Puerto Rico Tourism Company, the Puerto Rico National Parks Company, the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources, NOAA Office of Law Enforcement, and the Caribbean Fishery Management Council and will be expanding its work in FY09 to USVI in order continue raising public awareness throughout the U.S. Caribbean of the importance of marine ecosystems. This project is being initiated as a component of NOAA Fisheries' efforts on behalf of the Coral Reef Task Force established by President Clinton in June 1998 through Executive Order #13089 and NOAA's mandate under the Coral Reef Conservation Act of 2000. The Executive Order, identified as Coral Reef Protection, seeks to "preserve and protect the biodiversity, health, heritage, and social and economic value of U.S. coral reef ecosystems and marine environment". In order to meet the objectives of this work assignment, the contractor shall perform the work in three distinct phases: pre-production, production, and post-production. Short-term results will consist of a completed video and up to two Public Service Announcements (PSA)s. Long-term results will consist of an increase in public awareness regarding the protection of coral reef resources in the U.S. Caribbean when the ads are printed in the magazines. The project operation must be conducted in order to carry out the technical tasks described in this document within the established timeframe. The timeframe is essential to ensure NOAA Fisheries is able to broadcast the video and PSA or PSAs during the high season for tourists in July 2010 and again over the Christmas holidays in 2010. Demonstrate understanding of the scope of work in terms of creation and presentation of the video, video contents, and production of the PSA or PSAs. Ability of the contractor to create a product similar to that of the Hawaii Coral Reef Etiquette video as NOAA Fisheries has identified this as the type of product that will best meet our needs and reach our audience. Experience working in the U.S. Caribbean is preferable, as well as experience in education and outreach, film projects, and other efforts related to marine resource conservation using media and film. Information regarding NOAA's Coral Reel Conservation Program (CRCP) can be found on the internet at http://www.coralreef.noaa.gov. A copy of Executive Order #13089 can be viewed at http://www.coralreef.gov/taskforce/pdf/executive_order13089.pdf. A copy of the Coral Reef Conservation Act can be viewed at http://coris.noaa.gov/activities/actionstrategy/08_cons_act.pdf. The period of performance is date of award through June 20, 2010. Interested parties can request a copy of the Request for Quotation. This is a small business set-aside. The NAICS code for this action is 512110. Small business size standard shall not to exceed $29.5M. This support service is being procured under the guidelines of FAR Part 12, Commercial Items Procedures. Interested parties can request a copy of the Request for Quotation on or about July 8, 2009. Potential offerors are encouraged to periodically return to this site to obtain the Request for Quotation.

This maintenance required by the Department includes the following products and services listed in line item 001. The existing HR/EX/ESD Server infrastructure utilizes Dell platform architecture. To promote an overall lower Total Cost of Ownership, and to ensure continuing compatibility and interoperability, this procurement should be considered incremental to the existing infrastructure. The maintenance provided  see item 3 above for details  includes integral hardware, software, and service products, which augment the existing hardware system. Dell is the only vendor who can provide the specific products and services stated below, which are required to support the existing Dell Servers, precluding consideration of the products and services of any other company. 	Dell provides common images and components with its server platforms  helping to simplify management and cut costs. Dell has spent the last decade building commonality into the server family with the specific goal of simplifying management and maintenance, while reducing cost and complexity. 	ImageWatch  Dell provides a road map of upcoming software changes, allowing HR to better plan updates. 	Block updates  by delivering scheduled changes, Dell can help minimize the number of updates HR makes each year. 	Image commonality  by reducing the number of overall images in the Dell PowerEdge server line, Dell has reduced the time required for image maintenance. 	Component commonality  The Dell PowerEdge Server Family share common components (memory, hard drives, management cards and more), which help improve efficiency during build and servicing. 	Management commonality  Dell PowerEdge Servers are managed through a common interface to help maximize efficiency and streamline management. Dell OpenManage is provided with ALL Dell systems at no extra cost. OpenManage provides one management interface for hardware, software, and operating systems. 	Dell tracks configurations of every product down to the component level, which allows Dell to quickly and easily analyze product performance and take corrective action when needed. 	Dell provides investment protection when migrating to future Blade Server architectures (i.e., going from PowerEdge 1855 to PowerEdge 1955). 	Dell advocates use of industry-standard resource management software where competitors are proprietary (customer lock-in) and expensive.	Dell Systems Management provides a single tool to manage and monitor the entire enterprise of servers and storage products.

<DESC>Market Survey for vendors capable of furthering RUN TIME MANAGER/INDEPENDENT SIMULATION MODEL/AFTER ACTION REVIEW SYSTEM.<BR><BR>The Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), Program Manager Constructive Simulation (CONSIM) has a requirement for continued development of Run Time Manager (RTM), Independent Simulation Model (ISM) and the After Action Review System (AARS) systems under the Joint Land Component Constructive Training Capability (JLCCTC) program. The estimated value of this Cost Plus Fixed Fee award is approximately $2.5 M per year, for a total period of performance of 3 years. Efforts include software development, integration , testing of developed software, sustainment of existing RTM/ISM/AARS) systems. The contractor would continue the ongoing software development, training and integration, and augment the existing vendors effort to provide exercise fielding support critical to the RTM/ISM/AARS systems inside and outside the (JLCCTC). This exercise support is both CONUS and OCONUS. Award for this required effort is expected in Dec 2009. The existing systems are detailed below:<BR><BR>Run Time Manager (RTM)<BR>RTM system that supports the simulation to Command Control Communications Computers Intelligence (C4I) systems. This system processes simulation data by providing usable/valid information to and from the Army and Joint (C4I) systems. This simulation to stimulation and the stimulation to (C4I) constitutes a complete thread that begins with simulation and ends with the (C4I). This system must manage the data between these systems and in many cases, create data so the information can be more accurately depicted on the (C4I) systems. Continued development and sustainment of the existing system with no interruptions in service would be required. Source code and operations manuals would be provided by the existing vendor.<BR><BR>Independent Simulation Model (ISM)<BR>ISM is a system that provides a comprehensive, integrated tool set for full life cycle support of simulation-driven, master scenario event list (MSEL), to support training the (C4I) audience with (C4I) stimulation with or without the federation. This system allows planners and trainers to shape the environment by setting realistic conditions of organic unit (C4I) devices. Again existing source code and operations manuals would be provide by the existing vendor.<BR><BR>After Action Review System (AARS)<BR>AARS is a system that collects data from the federation and provides the after action review system and operators the ability to manage (reduce and analyze) the collected data and develop visual products (slides, charts, graphs) that provide useful information to facilitate the commanders after action review process. Again existing source code and operations manual would be available from the existing vendor.<BR><BR>The Government is looking for sources who can meet this requirement. Information from any sources able to meet the requirements will be reviewed for consideration. Any submittals should be proved no later than 24 July 09 Eastern Standard Time to the PCO via electronic submissions at milton.washington@us.army.mil. The point of contact for information regarding this action is Milton Washington at (407) 381-8854.<BR>DISCLAIMER: This notice does not constitute an invitation for bids or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not a commitment by the U.S. Government to procure subject products. <BR><BR>This announcement is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information solicited. This notice is to assist in determining potential sources and to perform market research.<BR><BR>Information on the incumbent contractor/contract is provided below:<BR><BR>BOOZ ALLEN HAMILTON INC<BR>CATHY COGGIN<BR>ATTN CONTRACTS DEPARTMENT<BR>8283 GREENSBORO DR<BR>MCLEAN VA 22102-3838<BR><BR>Contract Number: GS-35F-0306J, Delivery Order W91QF4-05-F-0058 dated 9 May 2005 <BR><BR>There is a 15 Page maximum limit in 12 Font type for Market Research responses.<BR>

<DESC><p>The flood of 2008 deposited large quantities of driftwood on the face of the Saylorville Lake Barrier Dam. The Barrier Dam is located off of highway 415 adjacent to the Saylorville Marina and approximately 1.5 miles south of Polk City, IA. Contractor will be responsible for the removal and disposal of all logs on the dam over 6in in diameter (measured exceeding anywhere on the log length). Access to the driftwood is only available from the Neal Smith Bike Trail located at the foot of the dam. Care in removal is needed to insure no damage is done to the rip rap surface of the dam. Any damage or displacement of rip rap shall be replaced by the contractor at their expense. Once driftwood logs are removed from the face of the dam they are to be hauled to a designated dump site where they are to be chipped.<br /><br />Work will consist of walking up and down large rip-rap rock on face of dam. Trees will be pulled/lifted from the face of the dam to the bottom of the dam with minimal movement of rip rap. Chainsaw work may be required to cut larger pieces of driftwood for ease of handling and hauling. Any rip-rap that is moved in the process needs to be put back into its original position. Once the trees/logs have been removed from the face of the dam the contractor will be required to haul trees to Sandpiper Recreation Area (1.1 mile) for them to be chipped. The dump location is a flat, level, open terrain for ease of dumping and chipping. <br /><br />On the west side of the barrier dam between the bike trail and the dam is a small grove of trees which need to be removed. Trees need to flush cut to the ground. All trees in the area need to be taken out except for the Pin Oak. Pin Oak trees will be marked by the Government with orange paint. Contractor shall use extreme care not to damage the Pin Oak trees.<br /><br />Work for this contract is to be completed thirty (30) days after contract award. Work days are Monday through Friday between the hours of 7 am and 5 pm. No work will be permitted on weekends or holidays. Five working days will be allowed to remove the driftwood from the rip rap. Chipping of the driftwood will be completed within two weeks of driftwood removal from the dam. Inclement weather may inhibit safe work and if so, the Government will allow for additional work days.</p>

1.0  Background

In August 2007, the Deputy Secretary of Defense directed the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Networks and Information Integration and DoD Chief Information Officer (ASD(NII/DoD CIO)) to develop and implement a comprehensive approach for safeguarding DoD unclassified information concerning weapons systems, technology, and combat capabilities when it resides on DIB unclassified networks.  To facilitate this effort, the Defense Industrial Base Cyber Security/ Information Assurance Task Force (DIB CS/IA TF) was established to work with DIB partners and DoD components to develop the processes and capabilities needed to secure this information from sophisticated adversaries.  In particular, a technology and architecture team comprising DIB and Government technical experts was chartered to investigate innovative, future-looking approaches to todays problems.   

1.1 Intent of the RFI
It is the intent of the ASD(NII/DOD) CIO office to use this market research to explore the feasibility and maturity of virtualization-based security  solutions and identify organizations which have plans to or experience in providing them.  The DIB Task Force will consider whether this approach has promise for protecting DoD unclassified information on DIB networks.  Specifically, the DIB Task Force is interested  in exploring the availability of virtualization-based commercial solutions for the following problems in network security.:

1)    Network hygiene provisioning via virtual infrastructure;
2a)  Reduced-risk Internet exposure via virtual machines;
2b)  Creation of a trusted enclave via virtual machines; 
3)    Employer-subsidized computers replacing employer-supplied computers.

The technology and architecture team will use these RFI responses to gauge the maturity of virtualization as an approach and the capabilities of specific companies to provide solutions.

2.0  Information Requested
2.1 Descriptions of the problems and exemplary use cases follow below:

1)  Network Provisioning:  The large number of components in and resultant complexity of todays network topologies make it difficult to determine the security posture of a network, much less maintain it in a desired state. Request #1 asks for solutions using virtualization to centrally create and manage images of controlled state and use them to rapidly provision network components.

Questions/Discussion:  Today configuration management of network components is generally performed case-by-case, scanning components for current state and applying patches, new settings, etc to bring the component into compliance with the desired new state. The configuration management controls operate under control of the operating system being managed. With the decoupling of logical and physical aspects of many network components (servers, hosts, others?) now possible through virtualization, can we now think about replacing piecemeal configuration of guest environments with updated images? 

Specific issues to address:  
	How often to refresh?  Refresh as prophylactic.  
	Relationship to Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) (see http://scap.nist.gov/ for more information).
	Do you have a solution or a tool that works this way?   Please describe.

2)  The attack surface of modern operating systems and many applications is too large to effectively secure.  It may be that the era of monolithic general purpose operating systems is nearing its end and could be replaced by a cluster of modules or virtual appliances acting in concert to perform services traditionally supplied by operating systems. Two such components, based on virtual machine technology, are described below. The first is designed for isolating risky environments to support safe Internet access and the other for isolating sensitive activity. It may be that the operating system of the future will consist of one or more of each of these components along with components yet to be described.

2a)  Reduce exposure:  Many of todays attacks come in through the browser or email.  Some are blatant, where the user is tricked into downloading and opening a file containing malware which then installs itself on the host; other less so, exploiting flaws in the browser to allow the malicious agent through. Either way, it seems clear that isolating risky activities like browsing and email in a non-persistent virtual machine separate from the users mission environment would make us safer, yet we are mostly not doing that.

Specific issues to address: 
	What, if anything, is missing from making this a common approach?
	How should session persistence, like bookmarks, be managed? 
	What might need to be done to support the selective movement of information from the safe browsing environment into the users environment?  
	Do you have a solution or a tool to meet this need? What are the limitations of your tool and why do you think it is safe?

2b) Trusted Enclave: This enclave would be used for performing sensitive operations or handling sensitive information. Virtual machines  (VMs) supporting this capability could be provisioned independent of the host operating system and refreshed from trusted sources when enough risk has accumulated to justify doing so. One way to do this is a hot spares approach: provision duplicated VMs, load the application into the first one and migrate it to the second one after a certain level of risk has been reached. The first one would then be refreshed from an immutable source and when the second one has reached a risky state the process would be reversed.  This could be done monolithically or surgically.

Specific issues to address: 
	How do you move useful information between this enclave and the outside world?
	Whats the potential to securely connect this environment to that described above (Case 2) without communicating malicious agents? 
	How do you measure the level of corruption in the enclave? 
	What triggers the switch? 
	Can the VMs be seamlessly migrated back and forth? 
	 Is it all or nothing, or can environments themselves be partitioned?
	There are a number of standards and APIs which are emerging in Virtual Machine Management, Virtual Machine Control and Virtual Machine Format. Which standards do you support and which task force or standards body (IETF, DMTF, ISO, ) do you expect  these standards to emerge from?

2c) Whose laptop?: It is becoming more common in businesses to replace company provided/company managed laptops with company subsidized employee purchases. One such initiative is described at http://money.cnn.com/2009/04/13/technology/fortt_choice.fortune/index.htm.  In this example, the employee owns the platform and provides the local administration. The company supports remote access for the employee by supplying a managed corporate image authorized to connect to its network.

Questions/Discussion: In the never ending effort to streamline costs, some in corporate America are changing how employee IT is provided. Instead of providing and managing a complete package of hardware and software for each worker, they are subsidizing the hardware and managing the software image which connect that hardware into the corporate network. These solutions may use virtualization to separate the corporate image from the users image; they may use remote display technology to centrally maintain the corporate image. The remote connection must be protected from the device connecting into it. 

Specific issues to address: 

	What solutions are available that effectively protect a corporate managed image on an unmanaged platform? 
	Are there remote attestation mechanisms to provide evidence to the corporate network that the connection should be allowed?

This action is funded by Recovery Act dollars. The M&O Contractor DUNS number is 175252894. The description of the work involved under this Work Authorization is shown below:

Required D&D activities include the following: (1) utility isolation verification, (2) hazardous materials and asbestos abatement, (3) removal of remaining internal process contaminated systems, (4) decontamination and immobilization, (5) demolition of above grade structures, (6) optional removal of foundations and sub-grade building components where required to support soil cleanup activities, (7) partial removal of below grade contaminated soil (8)removal of miscellaneous items outside of buildings within the work boundary, and (9) site restoration activities.  D&D activities shall include waste management, transportation, and disposal to appropriate treatment and disposal facilities.
				
Justification for Non-Fixed Price Type of Contract for WA* (added to description in FedBizOpps):
This was awarded as a Cost-Reimbursement Type because of uncertainties in contract performance.  Costs cannot be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract.  This is a collaboration between the Laboratories and a university for defense environmental cleanup.  The work is described but not defined and is very complex in nature.

<DESC>RECOVERY.  This notice is provided for informational purposes only.  General Atomics, 16969 Mesamint Street, San Diego, Calif., 92127 was awarded a contract in the amount of $32,727,170 (not-to-exceed), including $13,000,000 in 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funding (Project number 4201S).  The contract is for development of a prototype Hybrid Electric Drive (HED) system for a full-scale demonstration.  HED is aimed at improving the operating efficiency of the engineering plant on DDG-51 Class Ships and is intended to demonstrate the capability for significant fuel savings by incorporating advanced electric machine technology.  This supports the national defense imperative to reduce dependence on foreign non-renewable energy resources.  The contract was competitively procured under a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA).  Due to the nature of the effort being research and development in new technologies, the contract will be definitized on a cost plus fixed fee basis.  The Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington Navy Yard, D.C. is the contracting activity.  For questions contact the Contracting Officer, Timothy Starker at (202)781-3944, 1333 Isaac Hull Ave SE, Washington Navy Yard, DC 20376.
