<DESC>THIS IS A SOLE SOURCE SYNOPSIS!  Funds are not currently available for this requirement.

The 45th Contracting Squadron has a sole source requirement for the following:  CAS 1200 automated liquid handling system with controlling PC, Corbett Robotics, Inc. catalog #:  1200-200 (1 each); UV light system, Corbett Robotics, Inc. catalog #:  1141 (1 each); 2 year additional service contract, Corbett Robotics, Inc. catalog #:  CAS1200 (1 each); reagent block, 17 x 5 ml, flat base tubes, Corbett Robotics, Inc. catalog #:  1514 (1 each) and loading plate (33 x 2ml) free standing base tubes, Corbett Robotics, Inc. catalog #:  0647 (4 each).  The requested delivery to Patrick AFB, Florida is approximately thirty (30) days after receipt of an order.  This is a Sole Source with Corbett Robotics, Inc. IAW FAR 6.302-1.  Corbett Robotics, Inc. is the only source capable of fulfilling the government?s requirement as they are the only manufacturer for the CAS 1200 system and sole distributor of this system in North America.  Other liquid handling instruments are available, but they don?t match the specifications required by the MCA-B program.  MCA-B compared multiple liquid handling systems to the CAS 1200 and found other instrumentation inferior.  The MCA-B program has decided to use this instrument program-wide, so the need for this equipment will continue indefinitely.  The CAS 1200 system offers an internal UV sterilization capability to control sample contamination and assist with instrument decontamination.  No solicitation documents exist at this time.  This item/service utilizes Standard Industrial Code (SIC) 6640 with a business size of 500 employees and North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of 334516.  Interested firms may identify their capability to respond to this requirement.

The study period for this competition was May 3, 2006 through September 7, 2006, FBO Reference Number A-76HHSPSCESSOCCSSCOMPENSATIONSERVICES.  On September 7, 2006, the resulting certification of the streamlined competition form by the responsible competition officials indicated that the performance of the commercial functions and operations of the ESS/OCCSS Compensation Services should remain in-house with the agency?s Most Efficient Organization (MEO).  As a result of this performance decision, the designated Contracting Officer will execute an MEO Letter of Obligation with the agency official responsible for the performance of this commercial activity.

The purpose of this A-76 study was to determine the least costly and most efficient methods of operation as prescribed in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76, Performance of Commercial Activities, which sets forth the general policy of the Government to achieve economy and enhance productivity.  Consistent with procurement integrity, ethics, and standards of conduct rules, including restrictions of 18 U.S.C. 208, the responsible Contracting Officer submitted the streamlined competition form to the agency?s incumbent service provider for review prior to this public announcement of a performance decision.  In accordance with the streamlined procedures as specified with OMB Circular A-76, revised May 2003, the streamlined competition form shall be made available to the public upon request.  It is further noted that no party may contest any aspect of a streamlined competition.

FOB DESTINATION CONUS This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of purchasing a High Density Compact Moveable Shelving System. The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governmentøs requirements in regard to contractual obligations concerning the lease and building property management officeøs approval of the installation of the High Density Compact Moveable Shelving System in SA-34, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. Equipment listed above is required to provide maximum warehousing capabilities in a limited space to support the Department of Stateøs enterprise network distribution systems installations, modifications, and moves worldwide. The Installations Branch has painstakingly complied with Boston Properties requirements with regard to the National Office Systemsø High Density Compact Moveable Shelving System as designed for this specific government leased location. IRM/OPS/ITI/LWS/ITL presented a design for a High Density Compact Moveable Shelving System for SA-34 (7374 Boston Blvd, Springfield, VA) to Boston Properties Management Office for approval as a modification to a building or office space managed by Boston Properties on May 5, 2006. Because Boston Properties has approved the original design submittal; there are Fairfax County Building Permits to obtain and County Codes to adhere to; and the lengthy process and inspection procedures involved with the installation of a High Density Compact Moveable Shelving System ø the National Office Systemsø High Density Compact Moveable Shelving System should be purchased as currently approved by Boston Properties. The purchase of a nearly comparable rolling warehouse rack system or substitute may be cause to restart the approval process from the beginning and delay the county permit issuance and inspection processes.

No other individual is authorized, either verbally or in writing to change part numbers, manufacturer, quantity, delivery dates, or any other specification of this RFQ. Items that do not confirm to descriptions and part numbers found in this RFQ will be rejec 0044 ted at the time of delivery causing a return at the vendors expense. Bid MUST be good for 30 calendar days after submission New equipment ONLY, NO remanufactured products Agencies may require registration with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to receipt of order. Information can be found at www.ccr.gov FOB DESTINATION SHIPPING The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Consular Affairs, Office of Consular Systems and Technology (CA/CST).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the acquisition of HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Servers.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governmentís requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. The HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server has been identified as a key component of the Departmentís networking system, with the optimal server configuration to meet CA/CST/IIís Production Support Upgrades project needs.  The HP DL380 G5 server and components meet the following project requirements above and beyond other tested server options: ∑ Systems need to participate in a Systems Insight Manager environment for monitoring and management ∑ Systems must have a visible diagnostic display indicating system hardware health ∑ Must accept a variety of RAID controllers from low cost/performance to high performance while preserving compatibility of the data on the disks ∑ Systems must use Small Form Factor (SFF) SAS drives ∑ Systems must use common drives and RAID controllers ∑ Embedded NICS must be multifunctional (i.e., provide TCP/IP offload capabilities) ∑ CPUs must provide virtual KVM capability to include Power Meter Data Reporting ∑ 1U servers must support up to 6 SAS internal drives; 2U servers must support up to 8 SAS internal drives ∑ Systems must have front video/USB ports ∑ Systems must support redundant hot-plug power supplies with independent power cords that can be plugged into independent power sources ∑ Systems must have an option to support the same disks both internally and externally As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractorís unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departmentís requirements as a key component of the Departmentís networking system. CA/CST has selected the HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server because results obtain by the Bureauís System Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturersí servers indicated that these most closely met the DoSís processing, redundancy, and management requirements.  The requested servers will be deployed at a DoS facility which has established an environment comprised of HP equipment in the interest of overall cost economy, reliability, and ease of administration.  The continued use of HP servers eliminates the need to procure, maintain, and account for spare part inventories for multiple HW manufacturersí server configurations or to manage multiple vendorsí yearly support and maintenance agreements.   The HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server has been evaluated and approved by the Bureau of Consular Affairsí Configuration Control Board and will be added to the Consular HW Baseline.  The HP DL380 G5 has undergone test and assessment and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board. A) Sellers must bid exact match to spec (make, model and spec)  B)The products offered in this bid are brand new, not gray market and are in original packaging. C)  Seller is providing these products via Hewlett Packard authorized channels for new equipment Federal sales.  D) Full Hewlett Packard warranties will be provided and none of these products will have a negative impact on the warranties of associated system components. MUST BID HP BRAND, PER PART # ONLY. NO COPATIBLES, NO SUBSTITUTIONS, NO LIKE MFR ITEMS PERMITTED.

Information can be found at www.ccr.gov FOB DESTINATION SHIPPING The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Consular Affairs, Office of Consular Systems and Technology (CA/CST).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the acquisition of HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Servers.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governmentís requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. The HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server has been identified as a key component of the Departmentís networking system, with the optimal server configuration to meet CA/CST/IIís Production Support Upgrades project needs.  The HP DL380 G5 server and components meet the following project requirements above and beyond other tested server options: ∑ Systems need to participate in a Systems Insight Manager environment for monitoring and management ∑ Systems must have a visible diagnostic display indicating system hardware health ∑ Must accept a variety of RAID controllers from low cost/performance to high performance while preserving compatibility of the data on the disks ∑ Systems must use Small Form Factor (SFF) SAS drives ∑ Systems must use common drives and RAID controllers ∑ Embedded NICS must be multifunctional (i.e., provide TCP/IP offload capabilities) ∑ CPUs must provide virtual KVM capability to include Power Meter Data Reporting ∑ 1U servers must support up to 6 SAS internal drives; 2U servers must support up to 8 SAS internal drives ∑ Systems must have front video/USB ports ∑ Systems must support redundant hot-plug power supplies with independent power cords that can be plugged into independent power sources ∑ Systems must have an option to support the same disks both internally and externally As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractorís unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departmentís requirements as a key component of the Departmentís networking system. CA/CST has selected the HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server because results obtain by the Bureauís System Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturersí servers indicated that these most closely met the DoSís processing, redundancy, and management requirements.  The requested servers will be deployed at a DoS facility which has established an environment comprised of HP equipment in the interest of overall cost economy, reliability, and ease of administration.  The continued use of HP servers eliminates the need to procure, maintain, and account for spare part inventories for multiple HW manufacturersí server configurations or to manage multiple vendorsí yearly support and maintenance agreements.   The HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server has been evaluated and approved by the Bureau of Consular Affairsí Configuration Control Board and will be added to the Consular HW Baseline.  The HP DL380 G5 has undergone test and assessment and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board. A) Sellers must bid exact match to spec (make, model and spec)  B)The products offered in this bid are brand new, not gray market and are in original packaging. C)  Seller is providing these products via Hewlett Packard authorized channels for new equipment Federal sales.  D) Full Hewlett Packard warranties will be provided and none of these products will have a negative impact on the warranties of associated system components. MUST BID HP BRAND, PER PART # ONLY.  NO COPATIBLES, NO SUBSTITUTIONS, NO LIKE MFR ITEMS PERMITTED.

Information can be found at www.ccr.gov FOB DESTINATION SHIPPING The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Consular Affairs, Office of Consular Systems and Technology (CA/CST).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the acquisition of HP ProLiant DL380 G5 and DL360 G5 Servers.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governmentís requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. The HP ProLiant DL380 G5  and DL360 G5 Server has been identified as a key component of the Departmentís networking system, with the optimal server configuration to meet CA/CST/IIís Production Support Upgrades project needs.  The HP DL380 G5  and DL360 G5 server and components meet the following project requirements above and beyond other tested server options: ∑ Systems need to participate in a Systems Insight Manager environment for monitoring and management ∑ Systems must have a visible diagnostic display indicating system hardware health ∑ Must accept a variety of RAID controllers from low cost/performance to high performance while preserving compatibility of the data on the disks ∑ Systems must use Small Form Factor (SFF) SAS drives ∑ Systems must use common drives and RAID controllers ∑ Embedded NICS must be multifunctional (i.e., provide TCP/IP offload capabilities) ∑ CPUs must provide virtual KVM capability to include Power Meter Data Reporting ∑ 1U servers must support up to 6 SAS internal drives; 2U servers must support up to 8 SAS internal drives ∑ Systems must have front video/USB ports ∑ Systems must support redundant hot-plug power supplies with independent power cords that can be plugged into independent power sources ∑ Systems must have an option to support the same disks both internally and externally As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractorís unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departmentís requirements as a key component of the Departmentís networking system. CA/CST has selected the HP ProLiant DL380 G5  and DL360 G5 Server because results obtain by the Bureauís System Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturersí servers indicated that these most closely met the DoSís processing, redundancy, and management requirements.  The requested servers will be deployed at a DoS facility which has established an environment comprised of HP equipment in the interest of overall cost economy, reliability, and ease of administration.  The continued use of HP servers eliminates the need to procure, maintain, and account for spare part inventories for multiple HW manufacturersí server configurations or to manage multiple vendorsí yearly support and maintenance agreements.   The HP ProLiant DL380 G5 Server  and DL360 G5 has been evaluated and approved by the Bureau of Consular Affairsí Configuration Control Board and will be added to the Consular HW Baseline.  The HP DL380 G5 has undergone test and assessment and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board. A) Sellers must bid exact match to spec (make, model and spec) B)The products offered in this bid are brand new, not gray market and are in original packaging. C) Seller is providing these products via Hewlett Packard authorized channels for new equipment Federal sales. D) Full Hewlett Packard warranties will be provided and none of these products will have a negative impact on the warranties of associated system components. MUST BID HP BRAND, PER PART # ONLY. NO COPATIBLES, NO SUBSTITUTIONS, NO LIKE MFR ITEMS PERMITTED.
