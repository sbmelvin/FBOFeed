<CONTACT>Joseph W. Austin, Contract Specialist, Phone 315-330-4310, Email Joseph.Austin@rl.af.mil
<DESC><p>The Air Force Research Laboratory, Rome Research Site (AFRL Rome) has a requirement to conduct Information Support Server Environment (ISSE) Guard software enhancement, implementation, system integration, installation, operation and maintenance, research and development, and support for the Air Force Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) Agency's Combat ISR Office, the U.S. Intelligence Community, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Federal Law Enforcement Agencies, and existing ISSE user sites. This effort supports Air Force efforts in providing commands with required Cross-Domain ISR information and capability, when and where it is needed.</p>
<p>This Inter-domain information sharing program will enhance the current ISSE Guard at the Unified and Major Commands and their subordinate units and maintain the current ISSE Guard sites. Software development, integration, deployment and maintenance will be provided for the ISSE Guard. It will be necessary to provide analysis, design, development, integration management, system and network administration/operation, technical documentation and testing to support the maintenance and evaluation of existing systems and of new development systems. In the course of performance, the contractor personnel will interface with various agencies and commands throughout the DoD through electronic means and visits to various DoD and U.S. Intelligence Community sites worldwide. The contractor personnel will also provide technical expertise to AFRL/RIE for analysis, design, development, integration, testing and evaluation. Anticipated deliverables include software and technical documentation.<br /><br />This work will require a source that maintains a SECRET facility clearance and staff with approximately forty-five (45) TOP SECRET / SCI security clearances. An indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity cost-plus-fixed-fee (completion) type contract is contemplated with an ordering period of 60 months. The NAICS code for this effort is 541511, and the size standard for small business is average annual receipts of $23 million.</p>
<p>Evaluation of the capability packages received in response to the previous Sources Sought announcement resulted in a determination that a small business set-aside was not warranted. Although a foreign disclosure review has not yet been accomplished, it is anticipated that foreign participation will be excluded at the prime contractor level.</p>
<p>A technical read library, available on Compact Disc (CD), relating to the subject area of this acquisition will be available for review by potential offerors. This technology is listed on the Military Critical Technology List (MCTL). As a result, International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR) applies which requires the contractor to have a certified DD 2354, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement. The library contains sensitive technical data; therefore, prior to access being granted, respondents must submit a copy of an approved DD Form 2345, "Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement," which certifies the respondent is on the Certified Contractor Access List (CCAL), along with a letter from the Data Custodian designated on that form, authorizing access by whomever will be reviewing the library, to the ISSE Guard Program Manager at ATTN: Mr. John Woodruff, Air Force Research Laboratory/RIEB, 525 Brooks Road, Rome, New York 13441-4505, Email at John.Woodruff@rl.af.mil, or fax to his attention at 315-330-3913. For further information on CCAL, contact the Defense Logistics Information Service at 1-877-352-2255 or on the web at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/.</p>
<p>In accordance with AFFARS 5301.91, an Ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. Before consulting with an Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the Contracting Officer, Bonnie L. Goetz, (315) 330-2008, Bonnie.Goetz@rl.af.mil, for resolution. AFFARS Clause 5352.201-9101 Ombudsman (AUG 2005) will be incorporated into the resultant contract. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the Ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The Ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. Consulting an Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions). If resolution cannot be made by the Contracting Officer, concerned parties may contact the following AFRL Ombudsman: Susan Hunter, Building 15, RM225, 1864 4th Street, Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433-7130 FAX: 937-255-5036 COM: 937-255-7754. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the AFRL level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force Ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067. The Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency. Do not contact the Ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.</p>

<DESC>In a continuing effort to meet the publics demands and expectations for recreation opportunities and to maximize the value of available funds, a need has been identified for professional business consulting services to assist with the development and implementation of a more business-based approach to Forest Service recreation management.  
The Forest Service anticipates requesting business consulting services on an as needed basis for a variety of tasks.  These tasks may vary from being national in scope to affecting only one Region or National Forest.  For example, at the national level the agency may be interested in exploring options for enhancing partnership capabilities and expanding contributed income funding opportunities.  Services may be requested to help identify strategies and the Agency may seek assistance in pursing implementation support for the strategies. 
At a smaller scale, services may be sought on an as needed basis to assist with reviewing or improving various business processes.  An example might be to review financial analysis used to support capital investment decisions in a Region and provide advice on ways to improve the process.  In some cases, advice and assistance might be sought to assist a particular Forest in evaluating potential leasing or concessionaire opportunities.

The US Forest Service is seeking an organization to provide various strategic professional business advisory and assistance services for recreation management on National Forest System lands at locations throughout the United States and its territories.  Although the term recreation is used throughout this document and will be the primary area of focus for business services, that is not intended to exclude obtaining similar services for those program areas closely integrated with recreation management, such as wilderness, wild and scenic rivers, heritage, interpretation, conservation education, partnerships, and volunteer management.  The business advisory and assistance services may include elements such as:  strategic planning and program management; financial analysis; market analysis; operations efficiency evaluations; partnership analysis; facility management planning; marketing; interpretation strategy; and, organizational change management.  

Proposals are due at 3:00 p.m. MST, October 20, 2008.  The solicitation will be available on approximately September 5, 2008, and can be downloaded from this site at that time.  All responsible vendors shall be registered in the Central Contractor Registration database.  All responsible sources may submit an offer that will be considered.  The proposed project listed here is a partial small business set-aside.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to issue an order under Basic Ordering Agreement N00421-05-G-0001 for hardware and non-recurring engineering services required to mitigate obsolesence and develop, integrate, qualify and test, upgrades to the E-2D Mission Computer & Display (MCD) system and integrate the MCD onto the E-2C Hawkeye to support hardware and software commonality between the post production E-2C and E-2D aircraft.  The acquisition encompasses two phases - Phase I is for Pre-Milestone B effort and Phase II is for effort which may be incurred once Milestone B approval has been granted.  Phase I effort includes the preliminary design analysis leading to PDR which will result in a common E-2D and E-2C mission computer design  based on the E-2D MCD - the Common Core Mission Computer (CCMC).  It will also include a new Open Architecture (OA)/Tactical Information Services (TIS) software interface design/upgrades.  Upon Milestone B approval, Phase II will result in a new contract to complete the design and integration of theCCMC, TIS and rehosting of the System Configuration Set (SCS) on the CCMC.  NAVAIR intends to negotiate this order on a sole source basis with the Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation (NGSC), 600 Grumman Road West, Bethpage, NY 11714 under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements).  This MCD effort will be sole sourced to NGSC because competing another variant will result in substantial duplication of costs, to include life cycle support costs, that are not anticipated to be recovered through competition.  This synopsis is for informational purposes only.  Inquiries regarding the availability of subcontracting opportunities should be forwarded directly to NGSC.

<a href="mailto:yates.william@epa.gov">WILLIAM M. YATES</a>
<DESC>In accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and FAR Part 12 Commercial Items, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Dr. Michael Caprio c/o Mississippi State University, Department of Entomology & Plant Pathology, Mississippi State, MS 39762 to purchase required services to develop a simulation program that will model the development of pest resistance to new plant incorporated protectant crops with new complex pesticidal traits.  The population genetics (POPGEN) simulation model is a flexible, spatially complex individually based simulation model.  It is capable of simulating a number of different habitats in an area.
The POPGEN simulation model is for pest biology and has options for user defined inputs around the properties of the PIP (dose, mode of action), the pest management landscape (i.e., alternate practices, other PIPs etc.), the uncertainties around the genetics of the resistance (SS RS, and RR fitness, cross resistance), and the IRM plan itself (e.g., refuge, stack, mosaic, no plan).
A.	MINIMUM GENERAL SPECIFICATIONS:  Popgen, the population genetics simulation, must be a flexible, spatially complex, individually based simulation model.  It should be capable of simulating a number of different habitats in an area.  For example, a model of the mid-southern corn-cotton-soybean agroecosystem for Helicoverpa zea can be developed.  The model should include at least 40 different habitats (some fields may be described by different habitats at different times of the year depending on the phenology of the plants present).  The model should have the capability of examining selections in complex mixtures of habitats. 
The model shall be able to evaluate potential scenarios designed to examine the impact on the evolution of pest resistance attributable to one or multiple toxins with differing dose introduced sequentially or as a mosaic or as a pyramid. The modeler shall include an explicit description of the underlying assumptions of the model structure and input parameters. The model's output must offer some statistical evaluation of the results by establishing confidence interval around the predictions. Monte Carlo and/or uncertainty approaches may be applicable to the statistical evaluation.
The major processes within the model are mating, reproduction, ageing (including pesticide induced mortality), and dispersal. Each of these processes should be stochastic and the result of a binomial draw.  The model should be individual-based to the degree that individual insects are maintained (though grouped by age and genotype within a patch), and there are no fractional individuals nor alleles.  
The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 541611.   THIS NOTICE OF INTENT is not a request for competitive proposals. No solicitation document is available.   However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability of meeting EPA requirements by submitting technical documentation to William M Yates, Contracting Officer, at the office identified above, by fax (513) 487-2107 or by e-mail yates.william@epa.gov.   
Anticipated award date is September 5, 2008.  Documentation must be submitted to William M Yates by 3:00 PM, August 28, 2008 in order to be considered by EPA.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  Point of Contact for this requirement is William M Yates, Contracting Officer, at (513) 487-2055, or via e-mail at yates.william@epa.gov.   Questions must be submitted in writing to William M Yates via Fax (513) 487-2107 or via e-mail.  Telephone queries will not be honored.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) is soliciting firms that may be interested in performing a Cafeteria/Food Court Services Contract, including the recognized state licensing agency for the blind for Alabama (Alabama SLA). The Alabama SLA is solicited in order for GSA to comply with the Randolph-Sheppard Act and its implementing regulations at 34 Code of Federal Regulations 395.33 (a) and (b) and 35 (f).
The contractor shall establish and operate in the contractors name the noncommercial food service facilities for the purpose of dispensing food, nonalcoholic beverages, catering services, and other items as may be authorized by the Contracting Officer, in accordance with all terms and conditions of the solicitation. The contractor shall provide all management, supervision, labor, materials, supplies, and equipment (except as otherwise provided), and shall plan, schedule, coordinate, and assure effective performance of all services described in the forthcoming solicitation.  

Approximately 2,100 Federal employees occupy the subject Federal Building. The cafeteria facility, located on the Main Floor, occupies approximately 9,100 square feet with a seating capacity of 175 in the dining area and approximately 40 seats in Reserved Dining Area. Hours of cafeteria operation will be 5 days per week, Monday through Friday (except holidays observed by the Federal Government), as follows: Breakfast 6:15 am to 8:15 am, AM Break 9:00 am to 10:00 am, and Luncheon 11:00 am to 1:30 pm.

The contract will be competitively negotiated. It is GSA's policy to award cafeteria contracts to SLAs that have satisfactorily demonstrated capabilities to operate contract facilities. It should therefore be noted that an award to any SLA which would result in the facility being actively managed and operated by other than a licensed blind vendor (that is, by subcontract) is not acceptable and will be summarily rejected by the Contracting Officer. If the Alabama SLA determines to prepare and submit a proposal, the SLA should send a notice of its action to the Secretary of the US Department of Education in compliance with 34 CFR 395.31 (c).

Contract term will be structured as follows: Five (5) Year Base Period and two (2), five (5) year option periods that can be exercised by the Government.

The NAICS code for this solicitation is 722310. Food Service Contractors. The solicitation package will address details for structuring proposals.

A Pre-Proposal Conference will be held on-site, at the Birmingham Social Security Center, 1200 8th Avenue North, Birmingham, AL, on Tuesday April 22nd at 9:00 a.m. Central Time. 

The Solicitation package will be available electronically for download through the FedBizOpps website (www.fbo.gov). Please direct any general or solicitation access questions through email to Wes Zehms (Wesley.zehms@gsa.gov). Solicitation issue date will be on or about April 1, 2008.  

Responses will be due on May 1st, 2008.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans' Affairs is seeking the services of a qualified Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business to provide all labor, material, transportation, equipment and qualified supervision required to renovate approximately 9,800sf in area 2D, located on the second floor of Building 500 at the McGuire VA Medical Center, 1201 Broad Rock Blvd., Richmond, VA, 23249.  In general, proposed construction consists of the demolition of a space originally constructed for an inpatient nursing unit, and renovating that area specifically for those outpatient clinics currently using this space.  Renovations will require significant architectural, mechanical, plumbing and electrical modifications and improvements.  Work must be phased and coordinated to allow continued clinical operations in portions of the space with limited interruptions of services.  All work shall be in accordance with the construction drawings and specifications as prepared by Cornerstone Architects.      This project is to be awarded concurrently with another project to build a two story addition which adjoins the construction limits of this project.  The intent is to issue a Notice to Proceed upon contract award for the submission and approval of submittals and acquisition of materials.  Work will then be suspended pending completion and activation of the adjacent two story building addition, which is anticipated to take 410 days from contract award / Notice to Proceed.  This includes final inspection and clean-up.  Work on this project will then be resumed and shall be completed within 180 days after the 2nd Notice to Proceed.  While no liquidated damages will be accessed, timely completion and effective phasing of work will be critical to minimize the impact on existing operations and provide expanded clinical services.  Award is contingent on the availability of funds.      The NAICS code for this procurement is 236220 with a small business standard of $31,000,000. The estimated construction cost is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000.00.     The specifications and drawings will be uploaded as part of the solicitation on/about 9/2/08. A date and time for a pre-bid/walkthrough will be stated in the solicitation. The bid opening will be on/about 10/2/08. The deadline for receipt of questions is one week prior to the bid opening.    To be qualified to bid on this project, firms must be registered at Central Contract Registry and Vet Biz, prior to award. The Online Representations and Certifications must be completed by each bidder prior to the bid opening. Contract award is contingent on the availability of funds.

<DESC>Pre-solicitation Notice   8(a) Single Award Task Order Contract (SATOC) for Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH) in the Northwest Region (CO, IA, ID,IL, IN, KS, MI, MN, MO, MT, NE, ND, OH, OR, SD, UT, WA, WI, WY), primarily Fort Lewis The Contract Specialist for this solicitation will be Jan Slick, 817-886-1050; or by e-mail at errette.j.slick@usace.army.mil. FOR INFORMATION ONLY: This project is required by the Armys Military Construction (MILCON) Transformation initiatives under the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC), the Global Defense Posture Realignment (GDPR) (formerly known as Integrated Global Presence  Basing Strategy (IGBPS)), the Army Modular Force (AMF) program, and the Armys Grow the Force (GTF) initiative.  The Army must posture facilities to effectively orient combat capabilities where they can most effectively organize, train, and deploy to suppo rt ongoing operations worldwide.  The Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (ACSIM) has challenged the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to find ways to streamline its acquisition and construction processes in order to reduce costs and sp eed up overall delivery of projects, while at the same time providing quality facilities.  The Army requires a minimum 15% reduction in cost and a minimum 20% reduction in time to occupancy.  USACE, in response thereto, created eight Centers of Standardiza tion (COS) that are not only the design centers of expertise but also will become the acquisition experts for the facility types for which the COS is assigned.  Forty-one facility types were identified for standardization.  Of those forty-one, Fort Worth D istrict (SWF) has been assigned responsibility for the Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH), Basic Training (BT) Barracks, Advanced Individual Training (AIT) Barracks, Central Issue Warehouses and General Purpose Warehouses.  SWF has also been r equested by Army to provide a standard barracks design for the newly designated Warrior in Transition WIT) facilities.  The primary execution of the work under the SWF COS responsibility will be based on facility-type Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantit y (IDIQ) contracts.   The IDIQ contracts are based around current known requirements within four (4) geographic regions identified as Northwest (CO, IA, ID,IL, IN, KS, MI, MN, MO, MT, NE, ND, OH, OR, SD, UT, WA, WI, WY); Northeast (CT, DC, DE, MA, MD, ME, NH, NJ, NY, RI, VA, VT, WV); Southwest (AR, AZ, CA, LA, NM, NV, OK & TX); and Southeast (AL, FL, GA, KY, MS, NC, SC, TN) for an approximate value in excess $3.1 billion.   SCOPE OF WORK:   Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH), or other similar facilities:  UEPH facilities will house single soldiers and is intended to be similar both functionally and technically to apartment type housing in the private sector.

POC Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009.  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE; PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: SOCIETE  NATIONALE  DELECTRICITE  -  SNEL DEPARTEMENT  DE  RECHERCHE  ET  DEVELOPPEMENT, 2381, Avenue de la Justice, B.P. 500 KINSHASA, GOMBE, RDC, Tele: +243 81 700 54 93.  Democratic Republic of Congo:  Nzilo II Hydropower Plant Feasibility Study.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a Feasibility Study for the Societe Nationale dElectricite (SNEL). 

Stability and economic growth in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is crucial to the development of sub-Saharan Africa in general.  The size of Western Europe, DRC is centrally located on the African Continent, and shares borders with nine countries.  Improvements in the power and transportation infrastructure sectors alone could facilitate transcontinental trade, and provide electricity for large portions of Southern, Central, and even West Africa.  Although DRC faces diverse challenges to developing its economy, the nation also represents vast commercial potential, and wields tremendous influence over the stability of the region.  The Feasibility Study would examine the potential for a 33-80 megawatt (MW) facility, in the Katanga Province, expected to cost between $112 - $250 million.     

Prior to an extended period of war in DRC, the mining sector was the backbone of the nations economy, accounting for 85 percent of export earnings.  Currently, as DRC attempts to reconstruct its economy, it is faced with significant power shortages around the nation and also in the important mining province of Katanga, where the Nzilo 2 site is located.  This Feasibility Study would help ensure that the mining industry has access to sufficient power for the continued development of mining operations and value-added beneficiation projects.  After initial feasibility is demonstrated, it is envisioned that the Nzilo 2 site would be developed by SNEL in partnership with a mining company located in the region, a model that is being successfully implemented for several other power projects in the region.

For many prospective power projects in the DRC, preliminary data either does not exist or was destroyed during the war.  While preliminary assessments for the Nzilo 2 site indicate the potential for implementation, they lack detailed technical data.  Accordingly, the Terms of Reference (TOR) for this activity include many aspects of what the power industry refers to as a pre-feasibility study. This involves technical assessments of the topographic, hydrological and geotechnical characteristics of the site, which are essential to determining hydroelectric potential.  

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $553,534 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the TOR, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to: https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp.  Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firms name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in French directly to the Grantee by 4:00 p.m. on October 23, 2008 at the above address.  Please note that extra time has been already been built in to allow for French translation of the proposal.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>Odonate surveys:  The objective is to determine presence/absence of the 5 species of dragonfly on the Hiawatha National Forest Regional Forester Sensitive Species (RFSS) list.  Traversing the site by foot and identifying adults or larvae are acceptable means of conducting the work. A general description of the habitat conditions for odonates will also be made.  No vouchers will be collected.  However, the GPS location of each observation will be recorded.  It is the responsibility for the contractor to obtain the necessary state (Michigan) and federal permits (Hines emerald dragonfly).

All sites are located within the boundaries of the Hiawatha National Forest in Michigans Upper Penninsula.  Survey locations will be specified in the future if and when funding is available.  

Access to stand within the survey area will vary.  Some will have roads close by; others might entail hiking cross-country to reach the stands.  

Technical point of contact for this potential opportunity is Kirk Piehler, 906-789-3374.

<DESC>Vegetation mowing on the Hiawatha National Forest

Specifications for Vegetation Cutting Work
The prescription calls for use of mechanized equipment, such as a brushhog or other vegetation cutter.  Other types of contractor-owned equipment will be considered if the prescription can be met successfully.  

Vegetation Cutting:  The objective is to cut woody and herbaceous vegetation to within 12 inches of ground, resulting in pieces generally less than 4 feet in length.  Vegetation that is cut should come to rest within 24 inches of the ground.  All cut vegetation will be left on site.  

For the specified unit:	
   The units are primarily vegetated in jack pine less than 15 feet in height.  However, there may be other species of trees present.  Generally, other tree species approximately the same height or less than the jack pine should be cut and treated the same as the jack pine.  Larger trees (there are few of these in the unit) are to be retained. 
   Delays may occur if conditions are very dry and fire hazard is too high for safe operations, or if heavy rains saturate the soil beyond its ability to hold up under machine traffic.  The COR will make these determinations.

All sites are located within the boundaries of the Hiawatha National Forest in Michigans Upper Peninsula.   Locations will be specified in the future if and when funding is available.  A typical site will be vegetated in dense jack pine with blueberry, bracken fern, sweet fern and other herbaceous plants in the ground cover (see attachment).  Trees to be cut are generally 10-15 feet tall and less than 5 inches in diameter.  There may be a relative few other trees species present.  Terrain is generally flat.  There are furrows of varying depth present in the unit. 

Access to the unit is good.  If any roads are bermed, berms will need to be temporarily removed for access, and then replaced when the treatment is completed.  

Equipment
Minimum equipment required would be operator, vegetation cutter or brushhog or similar equipment of the proper type and size to perform the tasks indicated.

Section 2.0 DefinitionsCorrective Engineering  Changes necessitated by actual design errors and/or designdeficiencies.  Corrective engineering consists of activities normally considered to beerror correction required to keep the system operational.  By its nature, correctiveengineerng is usually a reactive  process.  Corrective engineering is related to thesystem not performing as originally intended.  The three main causes of correctiveengineering are (1) design errors, (2) logic errors, and (3) coding errors. Adaptive Engineering  Changes initiated as a result of technology upgrades and changesin the environment in which a system must operate.  These environmental changes arenormally beyond the control of the maintainer and consist primarily of changes to the:(1) rule, laws, and regulations that affect the system: (2) hardware configuration, e.g.,new terminals, local printers, etc.: (3) data formats, file structures: and (4) systemsoftware, e.g., operating systems, compilers, and utilities. Perfective Engineering   (Also commonly referred to as enhancements and upgrades) Allchanges, insertions, deletions, modifications, extensions, and enhancements made to asystem to meet the evolving and/or expanding needs of the user. It is generally performedas a result of new or changing requirements, or in an attempt to augment or fine-tune theexisting software/ hardware operations/performance. Activities designed to make the codeeasier to understand and to work with, such as restructuring or documentation updates andoptimization of code to make it run faster or use storage more efficiently are alsoincluded in the Perfective category.  Preventive Maintenance  As used in this statement of work Preventive Maintenance refersto hardware preemptive activities, such as cleaning filters and installing recommendedengineering changes, to avoid future failures.	Preventive maintenance activities areexpected to be included with a corrective maintenance task.

<DESC>See Note 25<BR><BR>                  <BR><BR>Market Survey/Request for Information <BR><BR>This is an Army/Marine Corps request.  All interested parties are advised that the Government will not pay for, or provide any reimbursement whatsoever for the information provided.  No contract or other instrument will be provided as a result of this request for information and no reimbursement will be provided for any information provided.  Therefore, any costs associated with the provided Market Survey/Request for Information submissions will be solely at the expense of the concern submitting the information.  <BR><BR>The PEO-GCS office, on behalf of the war fighter, is seeking information on Industrys ability to provide a lighter more agile, maneuverable, mobile vehicle with MRAP protection level capabilities, including EFP (removable kit) and RPG protection.  We are looking for an optimal solution that maximizes achieving both the indicated protection levels and the needed agility, maneuverability, and mobility understanding that such solution must balance the effects of size and weight while attempting to achieve the stated requirements.  An interested party will provide 1) a white paper not to exceed 10 pages describing their optimized solution, 2) a ROM for their solution, and 3) answers to the questions at the end of this notice by 15 September 2008.  <BR><BR>Providing the agility, maneuverability and mobility of a HMMWV, including off-road, while continuing to provide MRAP protection against mine blasts and other IEDs is anticipated to be more expensive than current MRAP vehicles.

<DESC>Concerns having the ability to furnish the equipment described herein are requested to give written notification (including the telephone number for a point of contact) to the procuring office above within 10 calendar days from the date of this announcement.  The Texas Water Science Center (TWSC) collects borehole geophysical data for several projects within the center and other centers throughout central region.  The TWSC recently procured a borehole Mount Sopris Matrix geophysical logging data acquisition console from Mount Sopris Instruments.  The TWSC's borehole imaging project work is mainly focused on carbonate geologic data collection and recently several projects have the need for unsaturated geologic data collection that borehold imaging in an air-filled borehole, to complement coring operations, interpret evnironments of deposition, characterize fracture and fault systems, and quantify this bed attributes.  The ALT OBI Optical Televiewer has the ability to perform these tasks well in small diameter air-filled boreholes present in Texas and Central Region because of it's very small diameter (1.6") and very high resolution 360 degrees RGP (24 bit) optical imagery in 2.365 to 11.8" diameter boreholes.  The TWSC needs this ability to obtain high resolution imagery in both air-filled and water-filled open boreholes with greater resolution that an acoustic borehold teleview can provide.  All equipment must be totally capable and operate with the existing Mount Sporis Matrix data acquisition system.
Based on information at this time, the government considers this equipment as a sole source from Mount Sopris Instruments and proposes to negotiate a contract with the firm on that basis.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered.  Firms who feel that they can furnish the required equipment are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement, and such other materials which correspond to the required items stated herein.  This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  Since no solicitation document exists, request for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration.  This notice may represent the Governments only official notice of this procurement.

<DESC><p>This is not a solicitation, but a Notice of Contract Action. The United States Air Force (USAF), Holloman Air Force Base, 49th Contracting Squadron, intends to award a sole source Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) purchase order to Brodart Co.; doing business as McNaughton Book Services. The McNaughton Book Service contract is a lease program for newly published books and audio books. The plan allows the library to lease the newest best sellers and popular fiction, nonfiction, and biographies. Under the plan, the library maintains a McNaughton lease collection of approximately 1,500 titles. Under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) persuant to FAR 6.302-1, awarding the contract to any other source would cause unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency&rsquo;s needs due to the library closing for an extended period of time to remove old books from the shelves and then receive and restock books from the new source. A determination not to compete this proposed contract is based on market research and is solely within the discretion of the Government. This announcement is not a request for competitive quotations. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency, not later than 27 August 2008, referencing F2E3LB8098A001, to Amn Kanon Morris, Contract Administrator, kanon.morris@holloman.af.mil. The government will review all responses, without prejudice, and determine if another firm is capable of fulfulling the Library Book Subscription requirement.</p>

<DESC><p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c)(1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."<br />United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), 7701 Tampa Point Blvd, Tampa, FL 33621, requires the repair and maintenance for two Avocent switches. The 6th Contracting Squadron intends to make an award to to Avocent Huntsville Corporation located at 4991 Corporate Dr. NW, Huntsville, AL 35805. Interested parties may e-mail stephen.colton@macdill.af.mil or fax 813-828-5111, Attn: Stephen Colton, not later than Tuesday, 26 August, 2008, 4:00 p.m. EST.<br />Per FAR Part 5.207-13(e) Fed Biz Ops Numbered Note 22 applies and is modified to read:<br />The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within five days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<br />DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTORS UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY)
<p>The Avocent AMX 5010 switches are used to manage the HQ USSOCOM Command LAN networks. The switches provide the LAN System Engineers the capability of accessing any one of the over 700+ servers from their workspace. The HQ USSOCOM Command LAN utilizes a network of approximately 25 Avocent AMX 5010s, as well as additional Avocent devices and switches.</p>
<p>Similar switches retail for for $11,495.00 and greatly exceed the Government estimate for the repair of the current switches. In addition, other switches offers similar features to the Avocent&reg; switch, but the user interface is different. HQ USSOCOM already utilizes over 20 Avocent switches and replacing the Avocent devices would require extensive engineering, programming, cabling and design to work with the existing equipment and would be cost prohibitive. Additionally, Avocent protects their intellectual property rights by invoking the benefits of the patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret, and unfair competition laws of the United States and certain foreign countries. No other vendor has the resources to repair these switches.</p>

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation is proposing to purchase a ThermaCAM P65HS Infrared camera from FLIR Systems, Inc., North Billerica, MA on a sole-source basis.  The Bureau currently uses the Thermocam Reporter Software package and has other FLIR lenses that are interchangeable with the P65HS camera.  It is likely that award of a contract to any other source for a comparable Infrared camera, software and associated lenses would result in substantial duplication of costs to the government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.

<DESC><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to issue a sole source firm fixed priced purchase order to Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health located at 630 W 168th St FL 4, New York, NY 10032. The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302; 4202 Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996. Contractors interested in this requirement should submit a complete technical package, which provides clear and convincing evidence that they can meet the Governments requirements. The core tasks and minimum contractor requirements will include: 1) Establish the nature and characteristics of complex statistical relationships (i.e., crosswalks) between the CDC HRQOL measures and other commonly-used HRQOL measures in datasets where the CDC HRQOL measures are used simultaneously with one or more other HRQOL measures-including the National Health Measurement Study database, which includes a national sample of adult survey data from the CDC HRQOL as well as the EQ-5D (EUROQOL), Quality of Well-Being Scale, Health Utility Index Scales, SF-6D Scale, and HALex measure. Other databases to be evaluated for analysis, which contain both the CDC HRQOL and one or more other HRQOL measure, are: a) the public-domain version of Medicare Health Outcomes Survey (MHOS) database (various years of which contain the CDC HRQOL-4 and either the SF-36 or the VR-12), b) state-added use of other HRQOL measures in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)-including the 1993-1995 use of the HALex by 16 states, c) the public-domain research version of the CDC Bleeding Disorders Surveillance System database (which contain the CDC HRQOL-4, the EQ-5D, and the SF-12v2). 2) Develop and document multivariable conversion tables and formulas--with appropriate subgroup stratification, adjustments, and confidence intervals--for estimating the scores of other commonly-used HRQOL measures based on responses to the CDC HRQOL measure. 3) Disseminate findings from these analyses via 3 or more presentations and 2 or more scientific publications to inform public health analysts, decision-makers, and current users of HRQOL methods. Anticipated award date is August 26, 2008. Responses must be received no later 12:00 Midnight Eastern Standard Time. Responses should be submitted to: Matthew Ellington 2920 Brandywine Road N.E. M/S E-01 Atlanta, GA 30341. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, the Government will consider all responses received before the closing of this notice. A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This procurement is not set-aside for small business. For contractual questions contact Mathew Ellington at mce8@cdc.gov. CAPABILITY STATEMENTS MUST DEMOSTRATE THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS OUTLINED ABOVE. Capability statements shall include the following information: company name, address, point of contact, phone/fax/email, and business size and status.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. 

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisitions (OA), intends to negotiate and award a contract on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Illumina, Inc. 9885 Towne Centre Drive, San Diego, California 92121-1975.   The intent of this procurement is to acquire FastTtrack Genetic Analysis (Genotyping) services using the Illumina iSelect Infinium custom genotyping array.  The genotyping services are in support of the ongoing Genotyping of Candidate Gene Variants for Blood Pressure and Cardiovascular Disease project as performed in accordance with the statement of work.

The sole source determination is based upon the use of these particular whole genome genotyping kits from Illumina, Inc., as it relates to the ongoing Genotyping of Candidate Gene Variants for Blood Pressure and Cardiovascular Disease project which is a subset of the Framingham Heart Study Offspring and Third Generation cohorts.

In order to avoid the introduction of new variables into the experimental results and to avoid long delays resulting from retesting of products from other potential suppliers, we must continue to purchase the genotyping kits from Illumina, Inc.   Also, in order to maintain the continuity of the methodologies used for the initial genotyping, an award to any other source for this follow-on contract would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.   

This action is under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1 and HHSAR 306-302-1.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all responses received within 15 days after publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.


The period of performance of this requirement is September 2008 through September 2013.

It is estimated that 5,950 SNPs in each of 7,379 subjects are required for the project.

Brief History/Purpose/Description of Project
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death and serious illness in the United States. In 1948, the Framingham Heart Study under the direction of the National Heart Institute (now known as the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; NHLBI) -- embarked on an ambitious project in health research. At the time, little was known about the general causes of heart disease and stroke, but the death rates for CVD had been increasing steadily since the beginning of the century and had become an American epidemic.

The objective of the Framingham Heart Study was to identify the common factors or characteristics that contribute to CVD by following its development over a long period of time in a large group of participants who had not yet developed overt symptoms of CVD or suffered a heart attack or stroke. The Framingham Heart Study continues to make important scientific contributions by enhancing its research capabilities and capitalizing on its inherent resources. New diagnostic technologies, such as echocardiography (an ultrasound examination of the heart), carotid-artery ultrasound, bone densitometry (for monitoring osteoporosis), and computerized tomography of the coronary arteries, are evaluated and integrated into ongoing protocols.

While pursuing the study's established research goals, the NHLBI and the Framingham investigators are expanding their research into other areas such as the role of genetic factors in CVD. Framingham investigators also collaborate with leading researchers from around the country and throughout the world on projects in stroke and dementia, osteoporosis and arthritis, nutrition, diabetes, eye diseases, hearing disorders, lung diseases, and genetic patterns of common diseases.

This project seeks to characterize genetic variation involved in key heart, lung, blood, and sleep disorders by extending knowledge gained from the recent genotyping of common genetic variation by the NHLBI Framingham SHARe project. Specifically, we will define the role of genetic variants more likely to have functional effects on gene products by targeting single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that have been implicated in altered gene expression (eSNPs), alterations in copy numbers (cSNPs), or alterations in amino acid sequence of proteins, known as nonsynonymous SNPs (nSNPs). 

Through bioinformatics approaches, we have identified several thousand eSNPs, cSNPs, and nSNPs. In addition, we will use some of the genotyping capacity of this project to type promising SNPs identified through recent resequencing projects (Levy and Newton-Cheh; ODonnell and Newton-Cheh). Those SNPs include synonymous and non-synonymous coding variants, frame-shift and nonsense variants (stop codons), and many non-coding variants. Last, we also will target for genotyping SNPs found to be associated with disease traits in genomewide association analyses of SHARe data or other published association studies. In general, we will target for genotyping those SNPs that were not genotyped as part of SHARe and for which imputation to the HapMAp SNP set was imperfect.

We plan to genotype 7600 SNPs of interest in the entire DNA plate set from the Framingham Heart Study Offspring and Third Generation cohorts (total n=7357) in order to determine which, if any variants are associated with heart, lung, blood, and sleep phenotypes in the general population. Identifying genetic variants that are robustly associated with these traits may provide insight into the genetic contributions to disease, which would further the cause of personalized medicine by allowing for diagnosis of susceptible individuals and for the identification of novel therapeutic targets for treatment of disease.  

This project involves the contractor performing genotyping of SNPs to be identified by Dr. Levy, Dr. ODonnell and members of their CPS research team. The SNPs will be genotyped in plate sets from the Framingham Heart Study Offspring and Third Generation cohorts with a total sample size of approximately 7,357.

The period of performance is September 2008 through September 30, 2013

This notice constitutes a BAA as contemplated by FAR 6.102(d)(2). This BAA is also listed at http://www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations/  (Business Opportunities/Open Solicitations). 


1. INTRODUCTION  
The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division is soliciting proposals from Universities to develop a long term partnership with NAWCAD to enhance Science Technology and Engineering and Math (STEM) education and collaborate on advanced research in support of Naval Aviation. 

2. BACKGROUND  
The purpose of this broad agency announcement is to establish a collaborative relationship between NAWCAD and an academic institution to improve the scope of advanced research and educational program development which relate to Naval Aviation.  Under this effort the participants will work on a broad range of research and educational projects pursued at NAWCAD, the participating academic institution or both depending on the availability of qualified personnel and facilities at each location.  NAWCAD and the participating institution will provide appropriate access to their facilities in support of these educational and research projects. By combining the personnel and facilities of NAWCAD and the academic institution, both parties will improve the overall ability to conduct research needed to solve current and future technological challenges pertinent to naval aviation weapons systems. 
New educational opportunities shall be developed between NAWCAD and the academic institution which will focus on meeting the future technology needs for Naval Aviation. Types of collaborative efforts will include the development of undergraduate and graduate educational opportunities.  These opportunities could involve the development of curriculum, assisting in participating as course instructors and the establishment of a cooperative educational program.
Because of the nature of this type of collaboration it is anticipated that the work will require personnel from the academic institution and NAWCAD to be able to meet frequently and on relatively short notice in each other's place of business.

4. CONTRACT/AGREEMENT TYPE
NAVAIR is willing to consider various types of acquisition vehicles including, but not limited to, traditional FAR/DFARS type contracts and/or non-procurement agreements (e.g. Cooperative Agreements and Other Transactions).  Other Transactions will be entered into under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2371 (Congressional direction requires that at least 50 percent (50%) of the cost of a project under this initiative be provided by industry) and Section 845, Authority to Carry Out Certain Prototype Projects.  Information concerning Other Transactions can be found at http://www.darpa.mil/cmo/pages/other_trans.html  and http://www.acq.osd.mil/ddre/research.  Final decision(s) on acquisition type (contract/agreement) will be made by the government.

NOTE: Typically, research findings result in the need for additional services/supplies, which are not possible to anticipate or project.  Contract modifications may be executed to satisfy these requirements; thereby providing for flexibility in technology assessment (with technology transition the ultimate goal).  In the event that this is required, it shall be considered to be within the scope of this BAA and the resulting contract, and therefore will have met the requirements of the FAR/DFARS and the Competition in Contracting Act.

5.2.1 General Information
Only Offerors whose Phase I - Proposal Abstract is considered capable of meeting Program requirements will be asked to submit Phase II - Full Proposals. 
&#61656;	Request for submission of a full proposal does not guarantee award selection.
Proposals shall be submitted in original, with the signature of an authorizing official, with five (5) copies to the address noted above. Proposal submission is not restricted in any way to any particular entity.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Minority Institutions, Tribal Colleges and Universities are encouraged to participate. The NAICS Code for this BAA is 541712. 
Submit Full Proposals in two (2) volumes; 

(1)	VOLUME I  TECHNICAL PROPOSAL, not to exceed thirty (30) pages, should include the following three sections: 
1)	Section 1 - Executive Summary: Provide a brief technical and business description of the contents of the proposal. The technical area should address the proposal's technical goals, approach, and expected results. The business area should address business and/or commercial applications of the proposal technology. 
2)	Section 2 - Technical Issues: Detail the technical approach, objectives, staffing and resources relating to the development of the proposed technology for military and commercial (if applicable) use; discuss specifically in realistic terms the technical objectives of this proposed effort; provide a Statement of Work (SOW) that discusses the specific tasks to be accomplished, tied to the specific approach and goals of the project; provide resumes for Principle Investigator(s) and other key research personnel; describe the current and planned facilities and equipment to accomplish the research objectives; and, give a description of past performance on similar efforts. 
3)	Section 3 - Business Issues: Discuss the business issues relating to the commercial applications of the proposed development and its impact on the market; detail benefits to the Department of Defense (DoD). 

(2)	VOLUME II - COST/FUNDING PROPOSAL. Cost/funding proposals are not restricted in length, have no specific page layout requirements, and should address funding periods of performance.  Formal work breakdown structures (WBS) and certified cost or pricing data are neither required nor desired, however, NAVAIR reserves the right to request this information for proposals using FAR/DFARS type contracts. Organize Cost/Funding proposals to include four (4) sections in the following order:

1)	Section 1 - Total Project Cost: This section will give a detailed breakdown of costs of the project. Cost should also be broken for each task appearing in the Statement of Work (SOW) and should include all of the proposed costs to the Government and cost shared by the offeror. Present the following information for each phase of the effort: total cost of the particular project phase; total offeror cost share (mandatory for certain "other transaction agreements" see above); funding requested from the Government; and elements of cost (labor, direct materials, travel, other direct costs, equipment, software, patents, royalties, indirect costs, and cost of money). Sufficient information should be provided in supporting documents to allow the Government to evaluate the reasonableness of these proposed costs, including salaries, overhead, equipment purchases, fair market rental value of leased items, and the method used for making such valuations. Profit should not be included as a cost element if the contract type to be awarded will be cost sharing. 
2)	Section 2 - Cost Sharing and In-Kind Contributions: This section will include: (i) the sources of cash and amounts to be used for matching requirements; (ii) the specific in-kind contributions proposed, their value in monetary terms, and the methods by which their values were derived; and (iii) evidence of the existence of adequate cash or commitments to provide sufficient cash in the future. Affirmative, signed statements are required from outside sources of cash. Provide sufficient information regarding the sources of the offerors cost share so that a determination may be made by the Government regarding the availability, timeliness, and control of these resources. For example: How will the funds and resources be applied to advance the progress of the proposed effort? What is the role of any proposed in-kind contributions? 
3)	Section 3 - Cost to the Government: This section will specify the total costs proposed to be borne by the Government and any technical or other assistance including equipment, facilities, and personnel of Federal laboratories, if any, required to support these activities. The cost to the Government should be that portion of the proposed effort, which is not covered, by the contractor's portion of the cost share. The costs incurred and work performed by any DoD or national laboratory "partnering" with the offeror under the proposal shall normally be considered costs of the Government and not costs of the offeror for purposes of the cost-sharing requirement. Present sufficient information regarding the resources to be provided by the Government so that an evaluation of their availability, timeliness, and control may be made. Section 4 - Off-Budget Supporting Resources: This section will show cash or in-kind resources which will support the proposed activity but which are not intended to be included in the total project cost. Items in this category do not count as cost share or as Federal funds, which must be matched. Examples of items to place in this category include: Commitments of cash or in-kind resources from other Federal sources, such as national laboratories, and projections of fee-based income where there is substantial uncertainty about the level which will actually be collected and where the income is not needed to meet cost-share requirements. 
NOTE: Proposals will not be accepted after the due date stated on Page One (1).
6. EVALUATION CRITERIA 
The government will evaluate proposals responsive to any or all of the areas of interest discussed herein. Proposals will not be evaluated against each other since each is a unique technology with no common work statement.  
6.1 EVALUATION CRITERIA
The primary evaluation criteria are: 
(A)	Scientific and technical merits of the proposed research to include, (1) the degree to which proposed research and development objectives support the targeted technical topic and (2) validity of the technical basis for the approach offered; and
(B)	The offerors capabilities, related experience, past performance on similar efforts, research investigators/personnel, facilities, techniques or unique combination of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives; and
(C)	The realism and reasonableness of cost, including proposed cost sharing. 
(D)	 The proximity of the institution to NAWCAD necessary to allow use and access to the facilities at both the NAWC and the institution while minimizing cost in time and travel.
7. AWARDS
NAVAIR is planning to make awards within the overall Program Objectives stated in Section 2 and 3. All awards will be based on merit competition. The Government reserves the right to select all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement.  Any awards are subject to the availability of appropriations.  There is no commitment by the Navy to be responsible for any monies expended by the offeror before award of a contract/agreement. For awards made as contracts, the socio-economic merits of each proposal will be evaluated based on the commitment to provide meaningful subcontracting opportunities with small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business concerns, and HBCU/MIs. If a full cost proposal is requested by the contracting officer, and the total exceeds $550,000, any large business is required to include a Small, Small Disadvantaged and Women-Owned Subcontracting Plan with its proposal package in accordance with FA

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--
(1) * Are, * are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; 
(2) * Have, * have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and
(3) * Are, * are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and
(4) * Have, *have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
(ii) Examples.
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

(2) [ ] Outside the United States.

(1) [ ] Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [ ] does [ ] does not certify that

(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.
(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies
(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and
(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.
(l) Taxpayer identification number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)

(ii)
(A) Any proposal, modification, or revision received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is late and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and --

(2) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Governments control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or
(3) It is the only proposal received.
(B) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful proposal that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.
(iii) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the proposal wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.
(iv) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that proposals cannot be received at the office designated for receipt of proposals by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation, the time specified for receipt of proposals will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.
(v) Proposals may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before award. Oral proposals in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile proposals, proposals may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before award, subject to the conditions specified in the provision at 52.215-5, Facsimile Proposals. Proposals may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or an authorized representative, if the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the proposal before award.

(e) Restriction on disclosure and use of data. Offerors that include in their proposals data that they do not want disclosed to the public for any purpose, or used by the Government except for evaluation purposes, shall --
(1) Mark the title page with the following legend:
This proposal includes data that shall not be disclosed outside the Government and shall not be duplicated, used, or disclosed -- in whole or in part -- for any purpose other than to evaluate this proposal. If, however, a contract is awarded to this offeror as a result of -- or in connection with -- the submission of this data, the Government shall have the right to duplicate, use, or disclose the data to the extent provided in the resulting contract. This restriction does not limit the Governments right to use information contained in this data if it is obtained from another source without restriction. The data subject to this restriction are contained in sheets [insert numbers or other identification of sheets]; and
(2) Mark each sheet of data it wishes to restrict with the following legend:
Use or disclosure of data contained on this sheet is subject to the restriction on the title page of this proposal.
(f) Contract award.
(1) The Government intends to award a contract or contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror(s) whose proposal(s) represents the best value after evaluation in accordance with the factors and subfactors in the solicitation.
(2) The Government may reject any or all proposals if such action is in the Governments interest.
(3) The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities in proposals received.
(4) The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the offerors initial proposal should contain the offerors best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.
(5) The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit cost or prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the proposal.
(6) The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards if, after considering the additional administrative costs, it is in the Governments best interest to do so.
(7) Exchanges with offerors after receipt of a proposal do not constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the Government.
(8) The Government may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if the prices proposed are materially unbalanced between line items or subline items. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques. A proposal may be rejected if the Contracting Officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government.
(9) If a cost realism analysis is performed, cost realism may be considered by the source selection authority in evaluating performance or schedule risk.
(10) A written award or acceptance of proposal mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time specified in the proposal shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.
(11) If a post-award debriefing is given to requesting offerors, the Government shall disclose the following information, if applicable:
(i) The agencys evaluation of the significant weak or deficient factors in the debriefed offerors offer.
(ii) The overall evaluated cost or price and technical rating of the successful and the debriefed offeror and past performance information on the debriefed offeror.
(iii) The overall ranking of all offerors, when any ranking was developed by the agency during source selection.
(iv) A summary of the rationale for award.
(v) For acquisitions of commercial items, the make and model of the item to be delivered by the successful offeror.
(vi) Reasonable responses to relevant questions posed by the debriefed offeror as to whether source-selection procedures set forth in the solicitation, applicable regulations, and other applicable authorities were followed by the agency.

(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business days written notification of its intention to:

The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractors CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of payment paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.
Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; fixed price proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is NAMA-08-Q-0120 and is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-26 effective June 12, 2008. This is a 100% small business set-aside under NAICS 334516 with a size standard of 500 employees. The Government reserves the right to make an award on the initial quote without discussions of this procurement. Evaluation and award will be in accordance with the procedures of FAR Subpart 13.106 Soliciting Competition, Evaluation of Quotations or Offers, Award and Documentation. Award will be made to the offeror whose conforming quotation in response to the RFQ will be most advantageous to the Government.  Best value for this order will be obtained through a lowest priced technically acceptable evaluation.  BACKGROUND: NARA uses a FTIR instrument as an important tool in its researching and testing laboratory.  However, with the current instrument, a Nicolet Magna IR 550, sample throughput is low and small samples are difficult to analyze.  The use of a Harrick Video Meridian Diamond Attenuated Total Reflectance (brand name or equal) accessory that would be compatible with the Nicolet Magna IR 550 and allow much higher sample throughput of much smaller samples, including a single fiber or a sample the size of a grain of sand would provide for enhanced FTIR capabilities that NARA requires for its research. REQUIREMENTS: Total price for CLIN 0001 Video Meridian with LCD Display and Diamond ATR Accessory (see attached Salient Characteristics).  DELIVERY: Packaging must be in a manner that prevents damage to the Video Meridian during shipment.  Delivery must be undertaken during regular business hours, Monday through Friday, unless mutually agreed upon by NARA and the Contractor. Delivery will be made to the following location: NAR - AII; 3301 METZEROTT RD, COLLEGE PARK, MARYLAND 20740-6001 no later than 90 calendar days after award of order (CLIN 0001). Vendors price quotation shall be based on the cost to supply the requirement as expressed in CLIN 0001.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL SERVICES PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. PROPOSALS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. The solicitation number is PR-NC-08-10520, and the solicitation is being issued as a full and open competition Request for Quotation (RFQ)using FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-25.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541380, which has a size
standard of $11.0 to qualify as a small business, is applicable.  A firm fixed-price contract is anticipated to result from the award of this solicitation.  This procurement is for the identification and analysis of foraminifera assemblages from a maximum of 400 marine sediment samples for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) using methods similar to those described in Hallock et al. (2003). EPA will provide the contractor with vials containing > 10g sediment (dry weight). Samples will be clearly labeled but replicates will not be identified until analysis is completed. The contractor shall analyze a minimum of one hundred (100) samples and a maximum of four hundredd (400) samples.  The samples will be delivered to the contractor in up to 3 batches (100 samples or more in each batch).  The period of performance 
of this contract is two (2) years from the date of award. The contractor shall submit a copy of Quality Assurance/Quality Control protocols  for review. These protocols shall describe chain of custody, organizational flow, and record-keeping procedures to be used during the contract period. They shall also include a description of how precision and accuracy shall be determined and documented. The contractor shall agree to allow a QA audit of laboratory and or data entry procedures by an authorized agent of the EPA at any time (with advance notice). The contractor is required to transfer copies of all technical, fiscal and programmatic files regarding this contract to the EPA Project Officer at the end of the contract period. These files should be labeled as ?EPA/USVI Assessment of Foraminifera?. Required services.  The 
contractor shall split the sample saving half as archival and return to EPA if not needed. Approximately 4 g sediment shall be separated for grain size analysis (Folk 1974) and ~1 g used to identify 150-200 foraminifera to the genus (not species) level as described in Table 1. Genus-level identification is recommended because it is historically well established and an excellent basic reference is available (Loeblich and Tappan, 1987).  If deformed specimens are observed, the proportions of deformed specimens should be recorded for the three most abundant taxa. For quality assurance, at least 10% of the samples should be independently evaluated (included in total sample number). Data Reporting. Final data reports shall be submitted in both hardcopy and electronic (Excel spreadsheet) format within 4 months of receipt 
of each batch. Results shall include grain size, raw foraminifera counts and sample weights with appropriate sample identifier and date of analysis. Analytical results shall include relative abundance (percent of a particular genus relative to all foraminifera in the sample) and absolute abundance (# specimens/gram of sediment) for each genus. The Foram Index (Hallock et al. 2003; Table 2) shall be calculated for each sample. Samples shall be reported in designated batches along with the corresponding QA/QC data for each batch. Table 1- Taxonomic identification and functional groups of foraminifera (Hallock et al. 2003) is available at the EPA Procurement website shown below. Table 2 - Calculation of the Foram Index (Hallock et al. 2003). Step 1. From each subsample examined, sort all foraminiferal specimens by genus, count, and 
record in a spreadsheet, with genera arranged by functional group. (See Table 1.) Step 2. Calculate the proportion (P) of specimens for each functional group by summing the specimens of each genus of that group (N) and dividing by the total number of specimens counted (T). a) Ps = Ns/T, where subscript ?s? represents symbiont-bearing foraminifers; b) Po = No/T, where subscript ?o? represents opportunistic foraminifers; c) Ph = Nh/T, where subscript ?h? represents other small, heterotrophic foraminifers. Step 3. Weight proportions to calculate the FORAM Index (FI):  FI = (10 x Ps) + (Po) + (2 x Ph). The EPA Procurement webiste shown below contains References and Bibliopgraphy.  The following FAR provisions apply to this solicitation: 52-212-1, Instructions to Offerors?Commercial Items; 52.212-2, Evaluation--Commercial Items.  Evaluation 
criteria to be included in paragraph (a) of provision 52.212-2 are as follows:  A. Technical Criteria: 1.) Provide a copy of QA/QC protocols, including plans for replication of analyses. 2.) Demonstrate previous experience with foraminifera assemblages and foraminifera identification. 3.) Provide a brief explanation of methods used for each CLIN, with references. 4.)

This procurement is for the analysis of up to 780 water column samples for dissolved and total nutrients (complete list is below) and total suspended solids for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in accordance with protocols established by the National Coastal Assessment Program (U.S. EPA 2001a).  EPA will provide the contractor with a split sample consisting of a filtered and unfiltered portion of seawater from each site.  Samples will be provided in batches (as collected) over a two-year period. Dissolved nutrient analyses shall be performed on the filtered portion and total nitrogen and phosphorus on the unfiltered portion of each sample. Total 
suspended solids shall be analyzed by weighing of tared filters provided by the contractor to EPA. Samples and portions shall be clearly labeled for each part of the analysis. The contractor shall analyze a minimum of two hundred (200) samples and a maximum of 780 samples.  The period of performance of this contract is two (2) years from the date of award. The contractor shall submit a copy of Quality Assurance/Quality Control protocols for review.  These protocols shall be the same as, or exceed those described for the Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (U.S. EPA 2001b). The contractor shall agree to allow a QA audit of laboratory and or data entry procedures by an authorized agent of the EPA at any time (with advance notice). At the end of the contract period, the contractor shall transfer 
copies of all technical, fiscal, and programmatic files regarding this contract to the Project Officer.  These files shall be boxed in accordance with Federal Record Keeping Standards in boxes required by the Records Center and labeled as ?EPA / USVI Coastal Assessment for Nutrients and Suspended Solids - Contractor Name / Contract Number? and contain an internal and external packing slip that identifies the specific contents of each box.  The external packing slip shall be affixed to the exterior of the box. To ensure comparable data of acceptable quality, EPA requires that all participating laboratories meet or exceed the following conditions and performance standards for the analyses of interest, whether conducted in-house or by a contract laboratory.  The methods described here are based on established analytical 
procedures that are generally accepted and utilized in environmental studies. EPA acknowledges there have been advances in state-of-the-art for some of the methods.  Therefore, in keeping with a performance-based approach to QA/QC, laboratories are encouraged to use their best available technology.  However, prior to approval, proposed modifications or alternative methods shall first be review by EPA to ensure that the program?s quality standards are met. Required Methods and Quality Assurance Criteria for the Laboratory Determinations of: Dissolved Nutrients and Total Nutrients (N, P); Total Suspended Solids (TSS). I. Dissolved Nutrient and Total Nutrient (N, P) Analysis. Automated colorimetric methods for the determination of dissolved N (nitrite+nitrate), nitrite, ammonia, ortho-phosphate, from a filtered portion 
of the seawater sample, and total N and P using an unfiltered portion shall be conducted using an auto analyzer (e.g., Technicon Auto Analyzer, or similar); the use of an auto analyzer is required to process samples in an expeditious manner. Nitrate concentration shall be determined indirectly by subtracting nitrite from nitrate+nitrite.  Instrument calibration shall be based on a 5-point standard curve for each nutrient analyte; calibration standards should bracket the concentration ranges of the field samples. Samples exceeding the standard curve range by >10% shall be diluted and re-analyzed. Samples should be analyzed in batches consisting of 15-20 field samples per batch along with the following required QC check samples: Laboratory blank; Spike/recovery check sample; Duplicate sample. Reporting units shall be in mg/L; samples 
shall be identified to the site by using the information provided with the samples. All samples shall link to a designated batch; final data reports shall be submitted both electronically (ASCI delimited) and in hardcopy format. Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) Requirements. The basic QA/QC requirements for the analyses of total and dissolved nutrients, as described in the National Coastal Assessment Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP), include the following: Method Detection Limits (MDLs) - 0.005 mg/L for N species; 0.002 mg/L for o-P; Calibration curve - correlation efficiency of =0.99; Percent Spike Recovery - ? 10% of true standard value (i.e., 90 - 110% recovery); Duplicate Analysis - Relative percent difference (RPD) of 30%;  Laboratory Blank - < 3x MDL. II. Determination of Total Suspended Solids(TSS).  
Laboratory processing consist primarily providing a tared filter to the field crews for processing the sample, once the processed filter is returned to the laboratory - drying the filter, then re-weighing to determine the weigh of residual material (suspended solids).  The preferred method for determining TSS is described in Section 6 (pp 1-3) of the EMAP- Laboratory Methods Manual-Estuaries, Volume 1: Biological and Physical Analyses (US EPA, 1995); the manual is accessible on the EMAP website [www.epa.gov/emap] under EMAP Documents by Resource Groups or refer to EPA Method 160.2: Residue, Non-Filterable Suspended Solids in Water  [www.epa.gov/rmdcrl/sop/sopdoc/AIG018.pdf]. These methods have practical application for the range of 2 to 20,000 mg/L. Quality Assurance/Quality 
Control (QA/QC) Requirements. Laboratories that conduct TSS determinations shall adhere to the prescribed procedures and meet or exceed the following QA/QC guidelines. TSS samples held under refrigeration at 4? C shall be analyzed within 90 days of collection.  If prolonged storage (>90 but <180 days) is anticipated, samples should be frozen; frozen samples shall be analyzed within 6 months of collection. Two laboratory procedures, weighing and drying the filters, are keys to success for the determination of TSS; therefore, QC records shall be maintained to document both activities. These procedures are discussed in detail in the above methods.  Performance of the laboratory balance used to weigh the samples shall be verified by a certified service representative on an annual basis. During periods of use, a QC check 
for accuracy of the balance shall be conducted weekly by using a set of standard weights (ASTM Class 2, or better).  These records shall be maintained in an instrument log book dedicated to that balance.  The temperature of the drying oven shall hold stable at 103 ? 3?C. The temperature shall be checked by thermometer and recorded on a daily basis; filters should not be left in the oven, unattended, over weekends. Along with each batch of 10-15 field samples, a blank and duplicate sample shall be analyzed. A laboratory blank of 500 ml deionized water shall be processed as per field samples; an acceptable blank results in = 0.5 mg weight increase for the dried filter.  Duplicate analyses shall be provided from the field to demonstrate measurement precision.  The relative percent difference (RPD) between duplicate 
measurements should be < 20%; this applies to samples that have TSS loads >10mg/L. Data Reporting. Final data reports shall be submitted in both hardcopy and electronic format within 3 months of submission of each batch of samples; electronic data shall be in ASCII comma-delimited or formatted text. Analytical results should be expressed as percent TOC; the laboratory shall report using the sample ID code; samples should be reported in designated batches along with the corresponding QA/QC data for each batch.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation W81NTE81028501 is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-05.  This acquisition is under NAICS code 339112. The requirements in this solicitation are:  CLIN 0001, 2 EA MEDIVANCE ARCTIC SUN 2000 CONTROL MODULE.  ITEM #200-02  CLIN 0002, 40 EA ENERGY TRANSFER PAD SETS SMALL KIT PART #317-05, 12 EA MEDIUM KIT PART#317-07, 20 EA LARGE KIT PART#317-09  CLIN 0003, 2 EA ETP UNIVERSAL PAD ITEM#317-00; CLIN 0004, 2 EA, CALIBRATION TEST UNIT  ITEM # 741-00; CLIN 0005, 2 EA EXTENDED WARRANTY.   Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Clause 52.211-6 Brand Name or Equal applies to this acquisition.  The salient characteristics for the Medivance Arctic Sun 2000 Temperature Management System are a water-based, non-invasive thermoregulatory device that monitors and automatically controls patient temperature within a range of 33oC to 37 oC (91.3 oF to 98.6 oF).  The Arctic Sun System consists of the Control Module and single-use Arctic Gel Pads.  Components provides the unique advantage of safe rapid deployment of therapy and effiicient temperature modulation.  The Arctic Gel Pads, the key component of the Arctic Sun System, have a unique construction that includes a water based, biocompatible hydrogel layer.  The hydrogel coated pads cover minimal body surface area and adhere to the patients abdomen, back, and thighs.  The Arctic Sun pulls water under negative pressure through the pads at a high velocity in a temperature range between 4 oC an 42 oC (39.2 oF and 107.6 oF) for rapid heat exchange.  The negative pressure flow prevents water leakage and helps ensure a safe and hassle-free work environment.  The other key component, the Arctic Sun Control Module,  incorporates an internal control algorithm that reacts to patient temperature by automatically adjusting the circulating pad water temperature to achieve a preset patient target temperature.  The temperature feedback from the patient is supplied to the control module using standard YSI-400 patient temperature probes, such as bladder, rectal, esophageal or nasopharyngeal probes.  The combination of an efficient control algorithm and thermal conductivity of the hydrogel results in thermoregulatory system that surpasses many expectations and proves to be a useful tool for patients undergoing therapeutic temperature modulation.  Vendors shall comply with FAR 52.211-6 if submitting other than the Brand Name product.

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

 NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

Also, this acquisition is being conducted under FAR 13.5, Test Program Procedures for commercial items.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is N62645-08-R-0020  The solicitation is issued as a request for proposal (RFP). Provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-24 are incorporated.  It is the contractors responsibility to be familiar with the applicable clauses and provisions.  The clauses may be accessed in full text at these addresses: www.acqnet.gov/far and www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/dfars/index.htm.  The NAICS code is 541990, with a small business size of $7 million.

The Naval Medical Logistics Command requests responses from qualified small business sources capable of providing animal study on NIDBR Drug Formulation with the following Statement of Work:

Background - The Naval Institute for Dental and Biomedical Research (NIDBR) requires contract services for testing of drug and placebo formulations in BALB/c mice with experimental cutaneous Leishmania major infections.
To date, NIDBR has conducted in vitro experiments on Leishmania major promastigotes and host  cells.  For parasite cultures, we have generated data to illustrate a dose dependent toxic effect of the active drug on Leishmania major. The LD50 for this drug was estimated to be 0.06 ug/ml and 0.03 ug/ml for administration of one and two doses, respectively.  To ensure that the active drug is not toxic to host cells, human skin flbroblasts have been used as controls. In these experiments, administration of 62 ug/ml did not exert a cytotoxic effect to host cells over a 24-hour period.

1.Statement of Work.

1.1. Objective. Determine the efficacy of NIDBR's drug formulations for the
topical treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis in BALB/c mice. NIDBR's proprietary drug and placebo formulation will be applied topically onto the rump of mice, which have been infected with Lmajor. Efficacy of tine treatment will be assessed through a number of parameters, including: 1)
measurement of lesion; 2) physical signs; and 3) recovery time. During the course of the experiments the animals will be monitored for indicators of drug toxicity by documenting body weight, food and water consumption, and activity levels of infected adults.

1.2. Technical Tasks/Requirements.

As detailed in the Paragraph 3, Requirements, the animal experiments would include:
1)inducing experimental cutaneous infections in BALB/c mice
2)applying topical application of NIDBR's drug or placebo formulation	
3)monitoring animals and recording data

The contractor will be required to communicate with NIDBR, on a monthly basis, to provide a summary of progress and to identify any difficulties or shortcomings. If problems arise, a teleconference or site visit (if necessary) will be held to promptly address and resolve the concern.

Animal research is to be conducted within a facility that is accredited by AAALAC. If the contractor handles large animals within their facility, then the USDA inspection requirements must be satisfied.

As a cooperative effort, NIDBR and Contractor will prepare applications and protocols that are required by all Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) authorities (i.e., Contractor's and Navy Surgeon General Oversight office (BUMED)). Experiments will not commence unless IACUC approval is obtained.

If needed, the Contractor will make accommodations to allow a site visit to the animal facility.

1.3. Deliverable: With the information detailed in the addendum, NIDBR expects to receive a report (hard and electronic copies) of all materials/methods employed and data resulting from this contract.
Blood collected at necropsy will be processed for plasma. Immediately thereafter, the plasma will be   aliquoted into 0.15 ml volumes and frozen ( -20C). Within a mutually agreed upon time, the frozen plasma aliquots will be shipped to NIDBR with an adequate amount of dry ice to maintain frozen samples.

If abnormal tissue is identified at necropsy, the tissue will be placed in a standard histology fixative and provided to NIDBR at a mutually agreed upon time.

1.4. Order Details

1.4.1 Period of Performance - The contract period is one year from date of
award of contract.

Contractor personnel shall also be informed that they shall not engage in any other action, venture, or employment wherein this information will be used for any purpose by any other party.

3. Requirements

3.1  Inducing experimental cutaneous infections in BALB/c mice
As indicated (paragraph 3.3), NIDBR will provide the Leishmania major promastigotes. Prior to inoculating the animals, the contractor must confirm the viability of the parasites, using light microscopy (400X magnification). If > 95% of the parasites are motile, the experiment will be initiated by subcutaneously inoculating five-week-old female BALB/c mice in the shaved skin over the sacrum on the dorsal line at the base of the tail (referred to as the rump) with 5 X105 metacyclic Leishmania major promastigotes. If insufficient parasites are viable, then arrangements will be made for another shipment from NIDBR.

The animals will be housed individually for the duration of the experiment. As dictated by the approved animal use protocol, routine animal husbandry, euthanasia, and disposal of carcasses will be followed.

3.2  Applying topical application of NIDBR's drug or placebo formulation
Mice will be divided into three groups. For the first two groups, three different drug doses will be tested (see attached table). Each group of mice will be treated on 6 or 12 weeks post-infection (wpi), respectively. Within the designated treatment period, the animals will be treated twice a day for five consecutive days. Topical applications will be given by rubbing (small circular motions) the drug or placebo emulsion on the lesion for 1 minute. Efforts will be made to prevent grooming of the treatment site for 10 minutes after the application of the drug or placebo formulation by one of the following methods: 1) administration of a low dose of medetomidine (0.03 to 0.05 mg/kg SQ) for short-term sedation. (This can then be reversed by atipamezole (1 mg/kg IP or SQ)); 2) administration of isoflorane inhalant; or 3) use of plastic rodent restraint cylinder.

The duration of this experiment will be 14 weeks. Mice within group three will serve as normal controls or as infected untreated controls.

B) The anticipated completion date for the preparation would have been August 1st.  However, there is a delay to this preparation and this may delay the start of the pavement by up to several months.



*What is the design thickness of the proposed asphalt layer?
C) The planned thickness will be 3" so as to allow our aircraft tow tractors to drive on.

G) Same situation as paragraph F.  The Air Force will give them directions for getting to our ramp.

<DESC>1.  a.  Sources are being sought to provide  one (1) radio frequency alarm monitoring system. The radio frequency alarm monitoring system is required to report the occurrence of fire, flooding, electrical current, unauthorized entrance, and unsatisfactory dehumidification and cathodic protection for thirteen (13) ocean-going vessels. Vessel mounted Remote Terminal Units (RTU) will collect data from sensors mounted at various locations throughout the vessel, determine if an alarm condition is present and respond to the alarm by initiating an immediate transmission to the Base Station, or store the data if it is within normal parameters.
b.  The System shall use a quiescent plus polled protocol, whereby the radio system is normally silent except when a vessel mounted RTU detects an alarm or an analog value change below or beyond set points preset by System operators for that sensor. The System shall be polled from the Base Station on a timed basis or on demand. The normal polling procedure will collect maintenance data from each vessel-mounted RTU (battery voltage, sensor status, communication status, current alarm conditions, etc.). An alarm event, defined as a digital sensor trip or an analog value outside of normal parameters, will cause the vessel mounted RTU to initiate an immediate communication to the Base Station. In the event of a communication failure, the RTU will continue to poll the Base Station until it receives an acknowledgement that the data was received. The radio system will use an approved error checking protocol to insure correct data transmission.
c.  The System shall be capable of independently monitoring a minimum of eleven (11) analog and digital or contact closure type sensors. The system shall be capable of expanding to fourteen (14) sensors per vessel. The number of vessels the system can monitor shall be unlimited. The Contractor shall be responsible for furnishing, integrating, and optimizing the system as well as installation, training, and long-term support. 
2.   This action is classified under NAICS Code 561621 ALARM SYSTEM MONITORING EQUIPMENT, SIZE STANDARD IS $11.5 million, SIC 7382 SECURITY SYSTEMS SERVICES.  Large and small businesses are encourged to contact the Contracting Officer before 8/25/08 if they provide the described services.
3.  Sources sought responses are due by 8/25/08 at 1:00 p.m. P.S.T. , by mail or email to the attention of Debra Velmere, Contracting Officer.  Please do not send facsimles.  Please include the RFQ number (DTMA4Q08014) in the correspondence.  POC Debra Velmere, debbie.velmere@dot.gov, Phone (415) 744-4140.
4.  The Combined Solicitation/Synopsis under the RFQ number DTMA4Q08014 (basic announcement) is extended to allow time for responses to the Sources Sought request deadline of 8/25.  Closing date of the Combined Solicitation/Synopsis is extended to 8/29/08.

Line Item 0001: Quantity Two (2) New Source Range Nuclear Instrumentation channels, which shall meet or exceed the following specifications:

Background

The NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR) reactor has been in continuous operation since it achieved initial criticality on December 7, 1967. The existing nuclear instrumentation is organized as three overlapping ranges of coverage, the Source Range, the Intermediate Range and the Power Range. The Intermediate and Power ranges were modernized in late 2004, and it is now time to replace the old Source Range equipment.

The current Source Range equipment uses 50-year-old technology. As a result of the modernization of the other ranges, the Source Range electronics takes up exorbitant amounts of rack mounting space needed for future overall control room upgrades, and utilizes high-power, inefficient power supplies that formerly powered the entire three-range system. Some components are no longer even manufactured, and many assemblies were essentially custom-built for the original National Bureau of Standards Reactor (NBSR). 

Objective

Replace the present Source Range electronics and mounting hardware with new, modern design equipment that is compatible with existing reactor controls and installed neutron detectors, and meet the specific performance specifications enumerated below.

Description

The Source Range nuclear instrumentation includes:  Two (2) boron neutron detectors, and two (2) coaxial cables that supply operating high voltage to the detectors from the Source Range electronics, as well as transferring the desired pulse signals from the detectors to the electronics for processing. The Source Range electronics consists, functionally, of two (2) separate, identical processing units that:

	Provide high voltage operating power for the detectors.
	Collect and process the detector pulse output signals.
	Generate analog output signals representing the logarithm of the pulse count rate from the detector and the period of the detected pulse count rate.
	Generate digital output signals representing analog signals that exceed adjustable setpoints for high period and for low count rate.
	Generate a digital output signal whenever the electronics is not operational.
	Accepts a digital input signal to turn off the high voltage supplied to the detector.

Additional, external electronics provides analog signal display and recording functions, combinatorial logic that processes the setpoint trip signals and provides reactor protective functions.

It is intended that the replacement electronics must be rack-mounted, first, in an interim movable short rack, so it can be stored outside the control room when not in use, and later, in the permanent electronics rack to be installed as part of a separate overall control room modernization program.


Specifications

Electronics unit must be mountable in a standard 19-inch equipment rack, and include pull-out slides with positive locks in the open, extended position, with screw slots for retention in the closed position.

Electronics must be compatible with a Reuter-Stokes boron-10 proportional counter neutron detector, model RS-P7-0812-117. Detectors have one (1) coaxial connector, type HN, used for both high voltage input and pulse signal output.

Electronics must include a variable-threshold pulse discriminator circuit to maximize neutron sensitivity in the presence of gamma flux.

Electronics must provide analog output signals representing Log Count Rate from 1 Count Per Second (CPS) to 1 X 105 CPS, and representing Reactor Period from -30 Seconds to +3 Seconds. Output signal may be a suitable voltage or current, but the most desirable  is Current Loop 4 mAmps to 20 mAmps; 4mAmps to represent 1 CPS and -30 Seconds, and 20 mAmps to represent 105 CPS and +3 Seconds. Corresponding front-panel analog and digital indications must be provided. 

Electronics must generate internal test signals for functional checks by operations and maintenance personnel.

Electronics must include circuits that generate alarm indications whenever the analog signals exceed specific, adjustable setpoints; a means of monitoring the two analog alarm setpoint values must be provided, preferably via the same front-panel indicators that display the operating signal values.

Electronics must provide dry contact relay outputs of dual Form C (DPDT) type for each of the three alarm conditions, wired such that the respective relay is de-energized upon loss of power, or whenever the alarm setpoint is exceeded (i.e.:  Count Rate > N CPS and Period is a more positive number in Seconds that the setpoint. In addition, the Channel Not Operational output relay must de-energize when the electronics unit is in any internal test mode, has detected any internal failure, or has lost power. Corresponding front-panel status indicators must be provided. 

Electronics must be powered by single-phase nominal 120 VAC line.

Electronics must provide detector high voltage from an internal HV power supply; HV range must be at least from 500 Volts to 1000 Volts, regulated.

Electronics must provide for a singe dry contact relay input to shut off the high voltage power output to the detector; high voltage must be applied to the attached detector when that contact is closed. Open-circuit voltage across the external contact must be less than 30 Volts.

Diagram:

Attached to this solicitation is a block diagram which illustrates the relationship of the Source Range electronics to the external logic, signals, and components. The GE Boron counter fact sheet which defines the performance required of the Source Range electronics in order to process the boron counters inputs to the electronics can be found at:

http://www.gepower.com/prod_serv/products/radiation_monitors/en/downloads/gea13542.pdf


Deliverables

Two (2) Source Range electronics units compatible with the specifications above.

Mating connectors for each connector used on the electronics units, plus one (1) set of spares. Assembly instructions, and any specialized tooling, must be included.

Spare parts sufficient to effect the return to operation of a failed unit, based on replacement of failed circuit board assemblies and/or failed modules such as power supplies. 

An Operation and Service Technical Manual in electronic, text searchable Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) form, on media the NCNR Engineering staff can accept. Internet download is acceptable.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to incorporate the following Questions and Answers.

Q1: What is the schedule for completion or delivery milestones for this project?  
A1: See RFQ.

Q2: What is the schedule for award and furnishing artwork for this project? 
A1: See RFQ.
 
Q3: Is there a PDF of the art files (either draft or final) that can be viewed so as to determine ink coverage, in-line color issues, binding issues, etc?
A3:  See attachment #1, draft version of the catalog. 
 
Q4: The perforation on the last text page runs vertical? 
A4: Yes the perforation on the last text page runs vertical. 

Q5: How far from the spine is the perforation? 
A5:  The perforation is at least -inch from the spine and can be moved out to accommodate.  
 
Q6: You specify double thick cartons for shipping.  Are the 275# test cartons we use for all Government projects acceptable?  Or do we need to furnish double wall cartons of a higher edge crush strength?  If so, can you specify the edge crush test so we can include the proper cartons in our bid? 
A6: Multiple shipping is done with the cartons therefore we do not have the specific edge crush test information.  It is imperative that the higher edge crush strength is utilized to ensure that the cartons do not get mangled or damaged during the multiple shipment cycles.

Q7:  This seems to be more of a proposal than a bid.  Should I create an offer in two volumes as I would normally in a peer review proposal?  In this case, pricing would come in one email and the technical proposal would come in another?  With the latter email being reviewed for acceptability before the pricing email is even opened?
A7: Please provide a quote as instructed in the RFQ.

Q8: When will we be notified if there are any clarifications or deficiencies in the proposal/offer?
A8: As stated in RFQ, FAR clause 52.212-1 Instruction to Offerors  Commercial Items.

Q9: When do you need pricing back?
A9: See RFQ.

All other terms and conditions of the solicitation remain unchanged.

The CCR can be accessed via the internet at www.ccr.gov/  .  Confirmation of CCR registration will be validated prior to awarding a contract.  Evaluation Factors: Technical Capability, Past Performance, and Price. 1. Technical Capability; Explain how your company will meet the scope of work paragraphs A.1.1 through A.1.5. NOTE: Statements that the offeror understands, can or will comply with all specifications, or statements paraphrasing the specifications or parts thereof, or phrases such as standard procedures will be used or well known techniques will be used will be considered insufficient. Insufficient explanations of how your company will comply with the above of this solicitation may cause your quote to receive a MARGINAL or UNSATISFACTORY rating. 2. Past Performance. Offerors are required to provide Past Performance Questionnaires from Two (2) firms/entities for which they are currently or have recently provided the same or similar supplies and/or equipment. Provide with your quote, the company names, telephone numbers, and points of contact that will provide the completed questionnaires for your quote. If an Offeror provides more than two past performance references, the Contracting Officer will consider only the first two listed references in the award decision. It is the offerors responsibility to ensure past performance references submit completed questionnaires directly to the Great Plains Regional Contracting Office (see below) by the solicitation closing sate and time., the Contracting Officer may also consider any additional past performance information that is available to the Government. Offerors are reminded that while the Government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of providing thorough and complete past performance information rests with the offerors. 3. Price. 4. Award will be all or none basis. Evaluation Process: All quotes will be evaluated in accordance with the following criteria: 1. Each vendor will be evaluated on its overall Past Performance under the existing or prior contracts for the same or similar supplies and/or equipment as well as Technical Capability. Pricing will be evaluated to determine value offered for the price and the extent to which it is fair and reasonable in terms of the Governments requirement. The Government reserves the right to evaluate quoted prices on the basis of price realism and will consider quoted prices as an indication of understanding the scope and complexity of the governments requirement. 2. The award decision will be based on the Best Value offered to the Government and not solely on price related factors. In making the award decision, the Contracting Officer will consider the evaluated rating of all factors. 3. Technical Capability and Past Performance are equal in importance. Technical Capability and Past Performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price. Price could become the determinative selection factor if the quality of quotes is determined to be essentially equal, or if a quote deemed superior in technical quality is determined not to worth the high price premium. The Trade-off between technical merit and price could result in awarding to other than the low offeror.

"ENCLOSURE:  Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14, 
Notice for Filing Agency Protests, is included with this solicitation.
Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

FOB; Destination, -Accountable Property Officer, Building 5464, Dugway Proving Ground, Dugway Utah, 84022,<BR><BR>(APR 2004) (a) This contract is eligible for the HQ, Army Contracting Agency (ACA) Executive-Level Agency Protest (ELAP) program, as an alternative to the usual provisions applicable for Agency protests under FAR 33.103. An ELAP is a "PROTEST TO THE AGENCY," within the meaning of FAR 33.103. The ELAP is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within ACA, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office (GAO) or other external forum. After an interested party files an ELAP protest on an ACA procurement to HQ, ACA and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the ACA ELAP protest, the ACA, ELAP protest will be dismissed. A party wishing to file an agency protest may either file a normal agency protest where the resolution is made at the contracting officers level; or, in the alternative, file an ELAP protest, where resolution is made at HQ, ACA. (b) An interested party may file a written protest to the Agency under the Executive-Level Agency Protest program for contract solicitations arising and performed within the continental United States. Such Executive-Level Agency protests are limited to objections to any of the following: (1) A solicitation or other request by an agency for offers for a contract for the procurement of property or services. (2) The cancellation of the solicitation or other request. (3) An award or proposed award of the contract. (4) A termination or cancellation of an award of the contract, if the written objection contains an allegation that the termination or cancellation is based in whole or in part on improprieties concerning the award of the contract. (c) Voluntary Automatic Stay. This clause describes the circumstances under which the ACA voluntarily agrees to stay performance of a contract in consideration of a decision by an interested party to file an Army Contracting Agency (ACA) Executive Level Agency Protest (ELAP), as permitted by FAR 33.103(f)(4). (1) In a standard post-award agency protest, the agency must not proceed with contract performance, pending resolution of the protest. This is known as an automatic stay and it mirrors the stay required under a timely post-award protest to the General Accounting Office (GAO) under 31 U.S. Code 3553(c) and FAR 33.104(c) (a Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) Stay). However, if the agency determines that performance must proceed, based upon the criteria set forth in FAR 33.103(f)(1), the automatic stay may be overridden. This is known as an automatic stay override. (2) The CICA stay applies only if the GAO protest is filed within 10 days from notice of award, or within 5 days of a required debriefing. A firm may file an agency protest and, if it is dissatisfied with the agencys protest decision, may wish to file a follow-on GAO protest.<BR><BR>Under normal circumstances, a protester that goes to the GAO after receiving an adverse agency decision will find that the GAO may take jurisdiction and actually render a recommendation, but that the CICA Stay no longer applies. (3) The ACA voluntarily agrees to stay performance of a contract when an interested party files a timely protest under the ELAP Program. Should the interested party disagree with the ACA's resolution of an ELAP protest, it may utilize another protest forum without prejudice. The ELAP Voluntary Automatic Stay extends the protesters right to preserve the status quo pending resolution of all protests with respect to a particular contract action. In return for the protesters initially filing its protest as an ELAP instead of with the GAO, the contracting officer agrees that, if the protester ultimately disagrees with the ELAP decision and files a GAO protest, the agency will agree not to proceed with performance just as it would have done if the protester had filed its protest with the GAO right from the start. This means that in an ELAP protest, the agency may override the stay under the same standards and circumstances as would have applied if the protest had originally been filed with the GAO. Nothing in this clause adversely affects an interested partys rights to protest a contract action to the GAO, or to seek other relief related to the action. (d) An Executive-Level Agency protest may be filed with the Contracting Officer designated in paragraph (g) of this clause for resolution of protests, or, with the ACA Chief Counsel at HQ, ACA at, 5109 Leesburg Pike, Suite 302, Falls Church, VA 22041-3201.

Designed specifically for use with Nikon D1/D2-series and D100 digital SLR cameras, it features wideangle zoom capability, ED (Extra-low Dispersion) glass and Nikon's exclusive built-in SWM (Silent Wave Motor). The lens is targeted at professional and advanced amateur Nikon D-SLR users who demand both the advantages of high optical performance and wideangle focal zoom range.This G-type Nikkor lens is designed with no aperture rings, and offers easier, virtually mistake-free operation because the aperture does not need to be set to minimum. Equivalent focal length in 35mm is 25.5-85.5mm.

It is a very robust and durable lens. Its lightweight construction incorporates a magnesium die-cast barrel, and professional-grade dust and moisture sealing allows it to be used in more rugged situations. This lens features the improved Vibration Reduction (VR II) system that allows handheld telephoto shooting, even in less-than-ideally lit conditions. The VR system minimizes image blur caused by camera shake, and offers the equivalent of shooting at a shutter speed of about 4 stops faster. In addition, this lens also features the Tripod Detection mode, which reduces vibration that may occur due to shutter release, when mounted on a tripod. The Silent Wave Motor (SWM) feature provides swift autofocus with superior accuracy and ultra-quiet operation. This G-type lens does not feature an aperture ring on the lens body, resulting in a lighter and more compact lens. Aperture changes are designed to be done via the camera's command dial. Note: VR function is only compatible with Nikon's F5, F100, N80, N65, D70, D100 & D1-series (or later generation) cameras.AF-S feature is not supported by certain older camera models.

<DESC>BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATIONThe new switch installed at the field office (FO) site will act as an expansion switch of the main NEC Telephone switch located at the Martinsburg VAMC.   Maintaining the NEC product line will enable continued feature and equipment compatibility, between the main switch as well as two other existing switch nodes located at CBOCs in Hagerstown, MD and Stephens City VA.   Switches will use Common Channel Interoffice Signaling (CCIS) technology that will connect the main switch to the nodes.   This CCIS connection will provide common full feature capability throughout all systems, providing users with same feature operation between systems. This feature will also allow centralize call accounting capability. The current system includes the following features: call transfer, call pickup, voice mail, four digit intra-station dialing, Least Cost Routing, Personal Identification Numbers, Class of Service Restrictions and Voice over Internet Protocol.  Use of another manufacturer other than NEC will jeopardize feature transfer operability between systems or eliminate them totally and create incompatible operating equipment between systems.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Chemical Science and Technology Laboratory (CSTL), is the United States reference laboratory for chemical measurements, entrusted with developing, maintaining, advancing, and enabling the chemical measurement system for the nation.  

The Process Measurements Division within CSTL, establishes and disseminates national measurement standards for thermodynamic parameters and engages in measurement science research to improve measurement capabilities for chemical process and related technologies. 

The Fluid Metrology Group within the Process Measurements Division of the CSTL provides calibration services for fluid flow, airspeed, liquid density and volume measurements.  The Group develops models, reference data, and novel techniques for improved measurements of flow, temperature, and pressure.  The Group uses acoustic techniques to determine the thermodynamic and transport properties of process gases.

The United States is moving towards a hydrogen based energy economy.  An infrastructure of hydrogen fueling stations is required to support the transportation sector.  Calibrated hydrogen meters are required in these refueling stations.  The Fluid Metrology Group has a responsibility to establish the metrology, metrics and procedures required to certify that these fueling stations meter hydrogen into customers vehicles with uncertainties of 1%, or less.

The Contractor shall provide all labor, equipment and material that, when delivered and installed, will simulate a hydrogen fueling station.

In accordance with the non-manufacturer rule, the manufacturer and  distributor of these supplies must be a small business in accordance with the NAICS code identified.  For size purposes, there can be only one manufacturer of the end item being acquired. The manufacturer is the concern which, with its own facilities, performs the primary activities in transforming inorganic or organic substances, including the assembly of parts and components, into the end item being acquired.  The end item must possess characteristics which, as a result of mechanical, chemical or human action, it did not possess before the original substances, parts or components were assembled or transformed.  The end item may be finished and ready for utilization or consumption, or it may be semifinished as a raw material to be used in further manufacturing. Firms which perform only minimal operations upon the item being procured do not qualify as manufacturers of the end item. 

The NAICS code for this requirement is 333912 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.

The competitive Request for Quotation (RFQ), specifications, RFQ amendments, and all questions and answers related to this procurement shall be made available via the Internet at HTTP://WWW.FEDBIZOPPS.GOV under RFQ number SB1341-08-RQ-0459.

The RFQ is anticipated for release to the vendor community on or about August 7, 2008, and will only be available via the Internet at the above web site.

Potential offerors are responsible for accessing the web site.  Interested parties must respond to the RFQ in order to be considered for award of any resultant purchase order.   No written solicitation document is available, telephone requests shall not be honored, and no bidders list shall be maintained.  Potential offerors are requested to direct all questions via e-mail to Carol.Wood@NIST.Gov.

<AWARDEE>SIRVA Relocation LLC, 6200 Oaktree Boulevard 
Suite 300 , Independence, OH 44131 US
<DESC>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), is the largest investigative arm of the Department of Homeland Security (ICE), it is responsible for eliminating vulnerabilities in the nation's border, and with economic, transportation and infrastructure security.  The ICE organization is composed of five integrated law enforcement divisions and several support divisions. These divisions of ICE combine to form a new investigative approach with new resources to provide unparalleled investigation, interdiction and security services to the public and our law enforcement partners in the federal and local sectors.

The ICE organization currently transfers approximately 800 employees annually, from, to, and between duty locations within and outside the Continental United States via its Employee Relocation Program.  The ICE Employee Relocation Program was established to provide enhanced benefits to relocating employees and thus facilitate the retention of well-qualified employees.  The program provides relocation assistance to help employees plan and complete moves to their new duty stations as smoothly as possible.  

Facilitating the real estate transactions and household goods moving services associated with these transferees requires the experience and dedication of a relocation service provider.  As a result, ICE currently has a requirement to procure Employee Relocation Support Services to include transportation, delivery and relocation solutions for all of its components.  

This service covers CLIN 0001 Property Management; the employee's property at the old duty location can be managed by the contractor. Service includes establishing a rental value, screening tenants, managing rent and property maintenance. Optional CLIN 0002  Home Marketing Assistance  Buyer Value Option and CLIN 0003 Move Management Services.

The period of performance will be one four month base period and two one-month option periods, for a total of six (6) months.
