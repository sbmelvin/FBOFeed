<DESC>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Synopsis<br />Intent to Sole Source
<p>The 14th Contracting Squadron, 495 Harpe Blvd, Suite 256C, Columbus AFB, MS 39740 intends to solicit and award a fixed price requirements, sole source contract to Northrup Grumman (NG). The purpose of the order is to obtain refurbishment of 19 Small Digital Voice Switch (SDVS) parts for five AETC bases.</p>
<p>This purchase is for a commercial item/service and will be made using FAR 12 and the Simplified Acquisition Procedures at FAR 13.5. Other than full and open competition is authorized pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii).</p>
<p>Past history of SDVS refurbishments has demonstrated that this work is a sole source requirement. This sole source requirement is supported by previous sole source contracts for SDVS with NG. To further solidify the government's position of being a sole source requirement a Sources Sought was posted to FBO on 17 Oct 14. No other firms expressed an interest in refurbishing the SDVS parts. However, one other firm, desired interest in performing SDVS support by replacing all existing SDVS with a new system. The Government did not find this feasible as there would be substantial costs associated with the replacement of all SDVS' and possibly incur unacceptable delays in the fulfillment of the requirement.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive quotes. However, interested contractors may submit a narrative describing their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort via e-mail to Joyce Slaven, Contract Specialist, Joyce.slaven@us.af.mil and Contracting Officer michael.schneider.26@us.af.mil no later than 2:00 PM CST 20 January 2015. Capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<p>The solicitation (RFP) will be available in DIBBS on its issue date of 01/23/15 at https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/RFP/. Solicitation number is SPE7MC15R0044.</p>
<p>The Small Business size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>TYPE OF SET-ASIDE: unrestricted</p>
<p>Specifications, plans or drawings are not available.</p>
<p>This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive technical data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).</p>
<p>While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, past performance, delivery and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.</p>
<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>
<p>One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the United States by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979. All offers shall be in the English language and in U.S. dollars. All interested suppliers may submit an offer.</p>

<p><span style="COLOR: black">The public is the primary beneficiary of the nation's intermodal transportation system built to serve public mobility and productivity. Transportation decisions need to be made in an environmentally sensitive way, using a comprehensive planning process that involves the public and considers land use, development, safety, and security. Transportation planners undertake a comprehensive analysis and evaluation of the potential impact of transportation plans and programs while addressing the aspirations and concerns of the society served by these plans and programs. Planners examine past, present, and prospective trends and issues associated with the demand for the movement of people, goods, and information at local, rural, tribal, metropolitan, statewide, national, and international levels.<br /></span></p>

<p>The Naval Air Systems Command intends to negotiate with Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation (SAC), 6900 <span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin">Main, P.O. Box 9731, Street</span> Stratford, CT 06615, on a sole source basis for the procurement of Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) of Lot 1 and 2 of the CH-53K helicopter. The intended contract will be initially issued as an Advance Acquisition Contract (AAC) in FY16 and FY17 for long lead items in support of the subsequent production buys. The production buys will be fully funded using FY17 and FY18 funding, respectively for Lots 1 and 2.</p>
<p>The LRIP contract will be contracted for on a fixed price type basis. The effort consists of nonrecurring and recurring engineering necessary for the procurement, fabrication, and assembly of aircraft, and installation integration of components and equipment including Contractor furnished Equipment and Government Furnished Equipment into the aircraft. This effort also includes test and check out of assembled aircraft, as well as logistical support for the aircraft. Requirements also include but are not limited to Systems Engineering/Program Management (SE/PM), Supporting Equipment and Tooling, publications, logistics support, quality assurance, reliability and maintainability programs, technical, administrative, and financial data requirements, spares, provisional supplies and services for training, logistics, engineering, and administrative support.

This notice is for informational purposes only. For subcontracting opportunities please contact Joshua Goodman, Sikorsky Subcontracting Manager, at 203-383-6028.</span></p>
<p>Note: The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within a forty-five day (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic order agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>ALL INFORMATION NEEDED FOR INTERESTED PARTIES TO SUBMIT A STANDARD FORM (SF) 330, ARCHITECT ENGINEER QUALIFICATIONS IS CONTAINED HEREIN. THERE IS NO SEPARATE RFP PACKAGE TO DOWNLOAD.

This procurement is for Architectural-Engineering (A-E) Services and will be procured in accordance with the Selection of Architects and Engineers Statute as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 36.6. This procurement is being solicited on an UNRESTRICTED basis; therefore, replies to this notice are requested from all business concerns. The Selection of Architects and Engineers Statute requires agencies to conduct discussions with at least three qualified firms during the selection of firms for Architect-Engineering contracts.
  The Sources Sought Notice for this requirement, dated 27 February 2014, did not reveal at least three small businesses that possess the required capabilities and capacity to accomplish the work expected under this contract.  FAR 36.101(b) states, When a requirement in this part is inconsistent with a requirement in another part of this regulation, this Part 36 shall take precedence if the acquisition of construction or architect-engineer services is involved; therefore, the rule of two normally used to determine whether a requirement can be set-aside for small business as described in FAR 19 does not apply to this procurement; therefore, Part 36 takes precedence over Part 19, including FAR 19.502-2.
  The NAVFAC Atlantic small business office and Small Business Administration (SBA) Procurement Center Representative (PCR) concur with this decision.

This procurement is a Cost-Plus-Award-Fee (CPAF) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) Architect-Engineer (A-E) Contract for Environmental Engineering Support Services for Comprehensive Long-Term Environmental Action Navy (CLEAN) in Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) Atlantics Area of Responsibility (AOR), primarily in the NAVFAC Mid-Atlantic Hampton Roads and Marine Corps Integrated Product Teams (IPTs) AOR, NAVFAC Washington AOR, NAVFAC Northwest AOR, NAVFAC Southwest AOR, NAVFAC Europe Africa Southwest Asia (EURAFSWA) AOR, and Puerto Rico.
 The general scope of this requirement covers A-E services to provide program management and technical environmental services in support of the Department of the Navys (DON) Environmental Restoration Program (ERP), including the Installation Restoration Program (IRP), the Munitions Response Program (MRP), and other similar programs at any DON or Marine Corps site within NAVFAC Atlantics AOR.  The principal geographical regions encompassed by this contract include the states of Alaska, California, Maryland, North Carolina, Utah, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Puerto Rico, the area of the District of Columbia, and, to a lesser extent, Wyoming, Arizona, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Europe and other Department of Defense (DOD) installations nationwide and overseas.
  The contractor may also, on occasion, be tasked to provide services described herein to any NAVFAC Command, any DOD activity, or other Federal agency activities in any geographic location.

a.	Those in support of the DODs ERP in compliance with the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) of 1980, as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA) of 1986, and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) of 1976. Support of Navy and Marine Corps Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) efforts is also included.
 Services include, but are not limited to: performance of site management plans, community relation plans, preliminary assessments, site inspections, remedial investigations, feasibility studies, RCRA facility investigations, corrective measures studies, interim measure plans, remedial and removal action designs, environmental assessments, risk assessments (both human health and ecological), contamination characterization, sampling, laboratory testing, presentations at restoration advisory boards (RABs), participation on partnering teams with regulators, operation and maintenance support, Geographical Information System (GIS) development and maintenance, and documentation preparation for facility support contracts and Title II management of remedial action implementation (including subcontract award and management); with emphasis on the accelerated schedules and increased sensitivity, visibility, and regulatory political and community concerns at Naval and Marine Corps installations.

b.	Those in support of the MRP.
 Services include the entire suite of Unexploded Ordnance (UXO) investigation stages consistent with CERCLA, progressing from a preliminary assessment/site investigation to a remedial investigation/feasibility study through the remedial design, all in accordance with explosive safety standards. Services also include methodologies for UXO detection, clearance, removal, and safety.

c.	Those in support of addressing large and/or complex Petroleum, Oils, and Lubricants (POL) sites with multiple sources and distribution lines, including assessment characterization, testing monitoring, and remedial action design and oversight. 

d.	Those in support of assessments, studies, investigations, and remedial designs that include other environmental programs such as air, water, waste water, solid waste, asbestos and hazardous substance/waste management, Range Sustainability Environmental Program Assessment (RSEPA), and complex compliance requirements requiring the integration of knowledge from several media and statutes in the United States and abroad.

e.	Those in support of expedited response actions.

f.	Those in support of the Navy Installation Restoration Information System (NIRIS) development and maintenance, Web page development and maintenance, GIS, and graphic support.

The contract requires that the selected firms have on-line access to e-mail via the Internet for routine exchange of correspondence.
 Attention is directed to FAR subpart 9.5 and the following provisions. An organizational conflict of interest may exist, if a firm has performed as an Environmental Response Action prime contractor and performs as a CLEAN prime or subcontractor at the same site. An organizational conflict of interest may also exist on a project basis for firms who have performed as prime contractors on other Navy environmental engineering contracts. Firms are advised that NFAS 5252.209-9300 Alt I Organizational Conflicts of Interest will be included in the contract.

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) is interested in receiving white papers and full proposals for developing technology in Small Unit Decision Making (SUDM) training systems for the US Marine Corps (USMC). Accelerating Development of Small Unit Decision Making (ADSUDM) has been approved as a new research opportunity under the Capable Manpower Pillar (CMP) Future Naval Capability (FNC). ADSUDM will deliver new or improved capabilities in the following three 3) areas:<br />- SUDM learning management,<br />- Situated, tailored, and automated simulation-based training and assessment, and<br />- Relevant tactical simulation training environments.<br />These capabilities may work independently and shall be able to interoperate as described below.
<p>Background: <br />While military science on decision-making has matured over the past twenty years, few research efforts have focused on accelerating infantry decision-making at the small unit level. The Marine Corps defines "small unit" as company-level equivalents and below. ADSUDM will focus on dismounted infantry squad personnel and operations and leverage the work done by Ross, K. G., Phillips, J. K., Rivera, I. D., Brown, T. F., Smith, K. M., &amp; Hale, K. S. (2012), Marine Corps maneuver squad leader mastery model.</p>
<p>The assessment of SUDM skills are largely subjective, with few Training and Readiness (T&amp;R) standards devoted towards higher order SUDM skills -- e.g. tactical thinking. The majority of SUDM training is accomplished using traditional instructional methods -- e.g., classroom or field based training with instructors. Some additional training occurs outside of the classroom using fielded simulation-based training capabilities, but these are limited and manpower intensive. Moreover, when simulation-based training methods are used they are too often not situated to reflect the relevant operating environment and the specific needs of the Marine in training. To address these challenges and develop capabilities that can accelerate decision-making training for Marine Corps infantry personnel, research proposals for the following three (3) scientific and technologies areas are sought:</p>
<p>- Decision Making-Learning Management System (DM-LMS) - DM-LMS will be based on mastery models (e.g., Novice to Expert), associated measures of effectiveness (MOEs) and measures of performance (MOPs). It will be capable of tracking and planning Marine SUDM skills development and characterizing SUDM readiness.</p>
<p>- Simulation Tailored Training and Assessment (ST2A) -- ST2A will augment current Marine simulation-based training (e.g., Virtual Battlespace -- VBS) with appropriate automated best practices in instructional strategies (e.g., adjusting timing, sequence, skill level, pedagogy) based on mastery model requirements and dynamically assessed Marine proficiency.</p>
<p>- Digital Integrated Representation of Tactical Environment (DIRTE) -- DIRTE will provide tools for rapidly modeling, editing and adding contextual elements (e.g., buildings and content in various states) to geographic terrain data bases for simulation-based training systems.</p>
<p>Objectives:<br />This call for science and technology white papers and proposals focuses on the three technical areas described above -- DM-LMS, ST2A, and DIRTE. The objective of the technical work is to deliver knowledge products, software, and possibly hardware that can enhance SUDM training systems and processes for USMC company-level equivalents and below.</p>
<p>Proposals may address one, or more, technical areas and should discuss how capability effectiveness will be demonstrated and measured. ADSUDM development efforts should incrementally address functional and technical requirements, growing capability in each area over time. ADSUDM capabilities shall achieve Technology Readiness Level (TRL) Six (6) before being deemed suitable for transition. ADSUDM's DM-LMS, ST2A and DIRTE shall use for the exchange of information open public standards, DoD mandated standards (e.g., Sharable Content<br />Object Reference Model (SCORM) xAPI) and / or open, formally documented, interfaces as most appropriate. The government shall seek license free Government Purpose Rights on all developed software and models and unlimited data rights on related open model specifications and associated artifacts. Finally, the government will conduct an independent evaluation of all final products (i.e., using performers not involved in the proposed research).</p>
<p>DECISION MAKING LEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM<br />Marine Corps Training Information Management System (MCTIMS) is a USMC source for Training and Readiness data, and the target acquisition program for DM-LMS. There are no Training and Readiness decision-making modules associated with MCTIMS. DM-LMS will provide a set of SUDM-specific, mastery model-based, MCTIMS software modules that support Training and Readiness planning and assessment. The following DM-LMS science and technology solutions are sought:<br />- SUDM mastery model that is an open, documented, machine-readable, knowledge base suitable for enabling ADSUDM functional and automation objectives,<br />- Definitions for Marine SUDM Training and Readiness standards and measures of effectiveness (MOEs) and measures of performance (MOPs),<br />- Validated SUDM assessment measures,<br />- Generation of tailored, simulation-based training curriculum and instructional products for individual Marines and small units that link to SUDM assessment measures,<br />-Knowledge repository and information services module, providing open management, analytics, visualization, and communications services for ADSUDM-related data, and<br />- An ability to define and link Training and Readiness criteria to a mastery model.</p>
<p>SIMULATION TAILORED TRAINING AND ASSESSMENT<br />ST2A software must reduce overall instructor time and effort required to identify, prepare, conduct, evaluate and report SUDM simulation-based training. Virtual Battlespace (VBS) is a target simulation-based training system for ST2A technology. The final delivery shall be VBS3 compatible. Ideally, ST2A will also work with other simulation based training platforms. The following ST2A SUDM science and technology solutions are sought:<br />- Automatically parse and adaptively execute and assess Marine performance based on scenario tasking passed from DM-LMS,<br />- Generate and execute locally created simulation-based training,<br />- Automate pedagogy using SUDM instructional best practices in the areas of situated tutoring techniques, biometric measurement techniques, adaptations to generate scenarios that fit student needs, and algorithms to assess the effectiveness of ongoing simulation-based training,<br />- Automate non-invasive, unobtrusive, and near real-time training interventions that enhance SUDM skills assessment,<br />- Simplify creation of enhanced situated and tailored scenario terrain and cultural features and import of DIRTE generated terrain data bases,<br />- Generate after action reports (AAR) for trainer/instructor reviews and reporting to DM-LMS, and <br />- Delivery of a SUDM Instructional Best Practices Guide (SIBPG) covering training effectiveness evaluation.</p>
<p>DIGITAL INTEGRATED REPRESENTATION OF TACTICAL ENVIRONMENT<br />Today, Marines rely on government agencies or contractors to build their VBS Terrain Data Bases (TDB). A product from Bohemia, Visitor 4, is available for building terrain, but it is difficult for novices to use. DIRTE functional capabilities shall provide novice modelers with time saving, rapid and automated methods for:<br />- Terrain modeling and editing, using unclassified geospatial data, and<br />- Combining and embellishing natural and cultural features to support tailored and situated SUDM simulation based training scenario requirements. The user should be able to "sketch" to add, remove or modify cultural and terrain features. Ideally, when sketching the software applies smart constraints to ensure reasonable results are rapidly achieved even by a novice user. A detailed Instructor/User Guide shall be delivered with the DIRTE software.</p>

<p>CONTRACT INFORMATION: This is a pre-solicitation notice for a Request for Proposal (RFP) for Fire Suppression Systems Inspection, Testing, Maintenance, and Repair, Fort Wainwright and Donnally Training Area, Alaska (FTW385). This acquisition is advertised as unrestricted, full and open competition. A solicitation is expected to be issued on or about 23 January 2015 and proposals due on or about 25 February 2015.</p>
<p>Contract award will be based on the best overall value to the Government considering the non-price factors described in the RFP and price. The Government will evaluate proposals in accordance with evaluation criteria specified in the RFP, FAR Part 15, and will utilize the tradeoff process described in FAR 15.101-1. Any resulting contract will be firm fixed price with elements of time and materials concerning service calls and parts. The anticipated Notice to Proceed date is 10 April 2015. This services contract will be awarded with one (1) base year, and three (3) option years. Offerors are advised that a contract resulting from this solicitation is subject to the availability of funds and may be cancelled or revised at any time during the solicitation, selection, evaluation, negotiation and final award. Should Congress not appropriate funds, the solicitation will be cancelled. If the project is cancelled, all proposal preparation costs will be borne by the offeror.<br /><br />All contractors are advised that they must be registered in the System of Award Management (SAM) (https://www.sam.gov/). Joint ventures must also be registered in SAM as a joint venture. We advise contractors to begin this process when they prepare their proposal in order to ensure this registration is in place should they be selected for the award. Lack of registration in the SAM database will make an offeror ineligible for award.<br /><br />PROJECT INFORMATION: The selected contractor is required to have sufficient staff, flexibility, and capability to be available on an as-needed basis. Interested firms must be able to provide all management, tools, supplies, parts, materials, equipment, transportation, and trained labor necessary to perform preventive inspection, testing, maintenance, and if necessary repair work for fire suppression systems of various manufacturers at Fort Wainwright, Alaska (FWA) and Donnelly Training Area (Bolio Lake/Black Rapids) to ensure fire suppression system serviceability and proper operation. The proposal schedule will include additional work for option years; however, there is no guarantee the options will be exercised. The estimated dollar magnitude of this project for the base and option years combined is anticipated between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000. The performance period will be approximately 365 calendar days (base year), with three (3) option years. Bid, payment, and performance bonds are not required for services contracts.<br /><br />SELECTION CRITERIA: This acquisition will evaluate offerors considering the following factors: Performance Capability (to include Specialized Experience, Organization/Technical Approach and Past Performance), Small Business Participation and Price. <br /><br />The overall evaluation of the non-price factors is considered slightly more important than price.</p>
<p>OBTAINING THE SOLICITATION: The solicitation, including plans and specifications, will be available electronically from FedBizOpps website (www.fbo.gov). On the FedBizOpps website, vendors will need to utilize the Vendor Opportunities Search function and enter this solicitation number to Search by Solicitation/Award Number.

<DESC>The Environmental Security Technology Certification Program (ESTCP) is the Department of Defense's (DoD) demonstration and validation program for environmental technologies.  The ESTCP Office is interested in receiving pre-proposals for innovative environmental technology demonstrations that address DoD requirements as candidates for funding.  This notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.102(d)(2).  Readers should note that this is an announcement to declare ESTCP's intent to competitively fund demonstration projects as described in the Program Announcement on the ESTCP website.   <br>  <br> The Program Announcement and complete submittal instructions is found at; <br>  <br> https://www.serdp-estcp.org/Funding-Opportunities/ESTCP-Solicitations   <br>  <br> To be eligible for consideration,  parties wishing to respond to this announcement must submit a pre-proposal in accordance with the instructions on the website, no later than 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Thursday, March 12, 2015.  No electronic mail or faxed proposals will be accepted.  <br>  <br> No request for proposals (RFP), solicitation, or other announcement of this opportunity will be made.  It is the sole responsibility of the offerors to make certain the proposal is properly received by ESTCP. Awards will take the form of contracts.  Submission of proposals is not restricted in any way to any particular entity.  The Government will not pay for any costs associated with the preparation of proposals, travel to present oral presentations in support of the proposals, nor initial preparation and submission of a project plan.  <br>  <br> There is no commitment by ESTCP to make any contract awards, nor to be responsible for any cost incurred by the offeror before contract award is made.  It is expected that multiple awards totaling approximately $6 million will result, depending on availability of funds.   <br>  <br> Awardees under this BAA will be selected through a multi-stage review process.  The pre-proposal review step allows interested organizations to submit technology demonstrations for Government consideration without incurring the expense of a full proposal.  Based upon the pre-proposal evaluation by ESTCP, each of the pre-proposal submitters will be notified as to whether ESTCP requests or does not request the submission of a full proposal. As noted in the instructions located on the ESTCP website, evaluation criteria for pre-proposals are, in decreasing order of importance, Technical Merit, Cost/Benefit of Technology, Transition Potential, and Cost of Proposal.   Due to the anticipated volume of pre-proposals that will be received, the Government will not provide debriefs to those that are not requested to submit a full proposal. Instructions for preparing a full proposal will be provided at the time of notification.  A request for submission of a full proposal does not indicate a decision has been made to make an award.   <br>  <br> Small business participation is strongly encouraged as the Government's goal is that small business, historically black colleges, universities and minority institutions participation represent 5 percent of the total contract award value.  If a full proposal is requested and the proposed budget is $650,000 or more, a Small Business Participation Plan (SBPP) must accompany the full proposal, whether it is submitted by a large or small business vendor.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes are 541712 and 541330 with the small business size standard of 500 employees and $15.0M respectively.  Selected contract proposals that exceed $650,000 submitted by other than small business concerns must be accompanied by a Small Business Subcontracting Plan in accordance with FAR 52.219-9.  The Humphreys Engineer Center Support Activity (HECSA) Small Business Office website at http://www.usace.army.mil/HECSA/HECSASmallBusiness.aspx  <br> provides information on how to prepare a subcontracting plan, along with links to find small businesses to participate. <br>  <br> Points of Contact:   <br> Procedural Questions - ESTCP, Ms. Jina Banks-Saunders, 571-372-6565;  <br>  <br> Contract Questions - HECSA, Ms. Susan Hill, Susan.M.Hill@usace.army.mil or 703-428-6420.  <br>  <br> Small Business Participation Plan or Subcontracting Plan - HECSA, Ms. Antwinette L.

<a href="mailto:mark.v.andrews2.civ@mail.mil">ACC-RSA - (Aviation)</a>
<DESC>The AN/TSQ-135 Mobile Tower System (MOTS) is a highly mobile tactical system designed to rapidly set-up and quickly establish air traffic services (ATS) during the initial phases of deployment, and sustain those services throughout operation and redeployment. The services provided include: sequencing and separating both arriving and departing aircraft; coordinating instrument meteorological condition (IMC) recovery of aircraft; and coordinating in-flight emergencies and personnel recovery actions. The MOTS is also tasked with the rapid restoration of terminal Air Traffic Control (ATC) operations during missions such as disaster relief or other Defense in Support of Civil Authority operations. The system is mounted on a Medium Tactical Vehicle (MTV). The system is air deployable by C-17 and larger aircraft, is CH-47 lift-capable (when separated from the MTV), and meets international Air Traffic Control (ATC) standards with modernized, digital jam-resistant, and cryptographic secured communications.  MOTS will utilize the Tactical Operation Center Inter Communication System (TOCNET) software. The MOTS provides secure, jam-resistant radio communication capabilities using 10 multi-function very high frequency (VHF) / ultra high frequency (UHF) radios and associated antenna systems that can be selected for operation in either the VHF or UHF bands. The system includes and interfaces with an AN/ARC-220 radio to transmit and receive ground-to-ground and ground-to-air voice. The MOTS includes cables, masts, and antenna mounting hardware to remote RF antennas up to 80 feet from the shelter. The system also includes meteorological sensors and the capability to locate these sensors a minimum of 3,000 feet from the shelter to provide measurements of conditions where the aircraft will actually take off and land. The MOTS is able to interface with the Airfield Lighting System (ALS). A climate control system with Environmental Control Units (ECUs) is required for the shelter. The shelter provides room to allow four soldiers in the target audience (5th percentile female to 95th percentile male Soldiers) to move within the shelter without stooping or bending to avoid overhead obstacles and not come into contact with other personnel and equipment, while wearing combat and protective gear in ECW, CW, or MOPP 4 clothing. The MOTS provides an operator console for a minimum of three operators that includes touch-screen, flat panel displays for data display. The shelter has a modular platform with stairs, or stair ladder, and handrail to allow safe entry and exit through the shelter door. The MOTS has an intermediate platform area with ladder, appropriate guardrails and toe board, suitable for allowing safe installation and removal of communication and collision avoidance equipment on top of the shelter. The shelter has a platform area with ladder, suitable for allowing safe maintenance of the shelter roadside windows. The windows of the shelter, except for the window located on the door, have a 15 degree slant preventing any reflectivity issues. The MOTS shelter is capable of dismounted (stand-alone) operations when the MTV is disabled, requires maintenance, is used for other transport, or the system is to be semi-permanently emplaced.  The MOTS will be fielded on the basis of one MOTS, per ATS Company, in each Airfield Operation Battalion and General Support Aviation Battalion.  Each ATS company provides terminal ATC for one fully instrumented airfield (MOTS, Ground-Controlled Approach RADAR/Air Traffic Navigation Integration Control/Coordination System (ATNAVICS), and a non-directional beacon) in theater.  These assets support main logistics bases that require airspace deconfliction and synchronization of a high density of fixed and rotary wing air traffic that is associated with high OPTEMPO operations.  The MOTS, when collocated with ATNAVICS, provides a near all-weather precision and non-precision approach, and instrument meteorological conditions recovery capability to aircraft operating within airspace designated for air traffic movement.  It also serves as the localized hub for communicating with combat search and rescue aircraft, medical evacuation aircraft, and provides current airspace/weather information to arriving and departing aircraft operating in the vicinity of its airspace.  The MOTS provides a capability to remote and operate the three operator positions at least 300 feet from the tower cab shelter, so that the operators can operate from a fixed based facility using MOTS system components.  <br> This Request for Information (RFI) is being issued to accomplish market research and to support pre-solicitation planning for Full Rate Production (FRP) of the remaining twenty-one AN/TSQ-135 Mobile Tower System (MOTS).

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 12pt;">In developing estimates, CEAD uses statistical cost projection techniques and a variety of data sources, including the Pell Grant merged applicant/recipient file, the National Student Loan Data System, the FFEL guaranty agency tape dump, and a variety of other Department data bases.&nbsp;&nbsp; Data also support the development of assumptions on a wide range of variable factors, such as interest, default, and collection rates, future income streams, program applicant and participation trends, and a wide range of national economic trends.&nbsp; Some of these assumptions are developed by CEAD or other Department sources; others are mandated by the Office of Management and Budget.<br />&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 12pt;">In the context of its program cost projection responsibilities, CEAD periodically must develop new techniques, revise or enhance existing approaches, and analyze and work with other Department offices to improve underlying data sources and assumptions.&nbsp; CEAD also undertakes a range of original research projects intended to develop improved modeling techniques, identify or develop better sources of data, and explore correlations between program trends and shifts in other Federal programs or the overall economy.<br /> &nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 12pt;">While most of CEAD&rsquo;s cost projection work is performed by in-house staff, the division periodically requires contractor support for activities that require specific technical expertise in areas such as: (a) statistical matching; (b) data imputation techniques; and (c) other econometric methods to dynamically age individual-based datasets using incomplete or time-censored data sources.</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 12pt;">Support would also include recommendations on data sources as well as data collection and analysis techniques.</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp; </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 12pt;">Data sources are expected to include, but not be limited to, the National Student Loan Data System, postsecondary studies conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics, and program resources such as the Direct Loan servicing and student aid application processing systems.<br /></span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 12pt;">CEAD is also required to provide senior executives with cost estimates and recommendations to make key funding and policy decisions on extremely short notice to inform ongoing legislative, or regulatory, or policy development activities.</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp; </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 12pt;">It is not unusual for CEAD to be informed of a new initiative and expected to provide definitive estimates and supporting analyses within days and in some cases hours.<br />&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">In supporting these activities, it is imperative that the contractor provides timely and high-quality technical assistance; it is expected that the Project Leader will have established rigorous project management and quality control procedures.&nbsp; The contractor must be available to respond immediately, as deliverables are sometimes required within 24 hours or less of the initial request. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">The contractor would also be expected to provide ongoing support and maintenance of the Student Loan Model (SLM), which is written in C-sharp and utilizes a Microsoft SQL Server database.&nbsp; &nbsp;The attached Performance Work Statement provides additional information about the proposed contract.<br />&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; page-break-after: avoid;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 12pt;">CEAD uses the SLM to project loan program costs.&nbsp; The SLM aggregates segments of student loans into cells (e.g. dollar value of FFEL Subsidized Stafford loans taken out for enrollment at a proprietary school in the fiscal year 2000) and calculates loan activity for these cells using pre-determined assumptions (which are also calculated based on aggregated data).</span></p>

<p>1. Technology assessment, including the ability to disaggregate the relevant technologies into private and public elements<br />2. Industry structure and behavior analysis, including the ability to understand and characterize the relationships between corporate strategy and investment patterns in public-good technology elements (infratechnologies, standards) and the ability to obtain original data from designated industries through scoping interviews<br />3. Analytical methodology development, including the ability to (a) characterize technology, structural and financing gaps in private-sector investment, (b) define appropriate metrics that reveal investment/underinvestment patterns, (c) demonstrate that the metrics/variables are appropriate for survey design and eventual quantitative analysis, and (d) select appropriate time series for "gap" estimation<br />4. Survey techniques/data collection strategies that maximize accurate responses from industry<br />5. Selection and execution of one or more modes of data collection<br />6. Report writing<br /><br />Economic Focus. The Contractor shall assess the nature and patterns of technology evolution in the subject area and estimate the annual potential cost savings for the technology area from improved technical infrastructure, specifically (1) new technology platforms and (2) infratechnologies and associated standards. <br /><br />Technology and Industry Focus. The Contractor's emphasis shall be on those technology platforms and infratechnologies that are assessed to have large potential economic impact. Technology platforms include both generic product and process technologies that will serve as the basis for future product and process innovations. Infratechnologies to be analyzed include techniques, methods, models, and databases used by industry to define, conduct, and assess R&amp;D for both product and process development, and to facilitate technology diffusion and marketplace transactions by assuring compliance with product/process specifications.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall include all industries that are projected to be innovators and direct users of advanced manufacturing technologies.</p>
<p>Baseline Data: The Contractor's major focus shall be industry impact data including investment (R&amp;D and "fixed private investment" as defined by BEA-especially hardware and software), subsequent productivity trends, and ultimate market growth potential. For the purposes of this study, the industries to be studied must be those that are either suppliers or users of the relevant technologies. <br /><br />Productivity/Cost/Innovation/Market Penetration Impacts: The Contractor shall rank the resulting gap analyses associated with advanced manufacturing platform technologies and infratechnologies/standards in terms of potential reductions in labor, equipment, and material costs, as well as the realization of the overall market potential of the subject technologies. <br /><br />This shall be accomplished in the following tasks:</p>
<p>PHASE I:</p>
<p>Task A: Technology and Industry Analysis. The Contractor shall describe, assess technical and economic trends, and project future developments for MGI. Using this broad and cross-cutting technology platform as a point of departure, the Contractor shall describe, characterize, and assess the relevant Industry technology elements and supporting infratechnology investment trends; provide initial ranking and assessment of the strategic importance of each category individually and as an entire infrastructure, and analyze underinvestment patterns for each of the three case studies. The Contractor shall then place the analysis in the context of competitive trends (R&amp;D, capital formation, sales) in the domestic and global economies, emphasizing product, process and infratechnology investment and resulting market share patterns. The Contractor shall use conventional research techniques and scoping interviews as data sources.<br /><br />The Contractor shall provide a Technology and Industry report to NIST to become part of the final report that includes</p>
<p>1. Description, characterization and assessment of the technological and economic trends relating to smart manufacturing as an evolving ubiquitous technology platform <br />2. Descriptions of the nature of the relevant technologies and supporting technology infrastructure (technology platforms and infratechnologies /associated standards) <br />pertinent to the Materials Genome Initiative<br />3. Characterization and analysis of the economic roles and leverage of technology infrastructure s for the case study<br />4. Documentation of major investment trends by technology area, covering all tiers in the relevant supply chains<br />5. Initial characterization and ranking of infratechnologies and gaps relative to need, including equipment, methods, interfaces, data, and IT infrastructure<br />specific product categories most likely to be affected by these infratechnologies<br />6. The completed background case studies that illuminate the above analysis factors<br />7. Analysis of the causes of private sector underinvestment in the areas identified as technical gaps.</p>
<p>Task B: Economic Analysis Framework. The Contractor shall develop an Economic Analysis Framework for the desired economic analysis based on background research, the Technology and Industry report, scoping interviews and other sources of expertise to develop hypothesized underinvestment scenarios and associated metrics to drive data collection.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall produce an Economic Analysis Framework report and include it as part of the final report that includes:</p>
<p>1. Framework for analysis of the economic consequences of inadequate infratechnologies that is<br />a. produced from literature reviews, initial informal industry interviews, and consultations with NIST and industry experts<br />b. built on a taxonomy of product and service impact categories, their characteristics, and interactions with infratechnologies <br />c. focused on hypothesized barriers/costs for each impact category from inadequate infratechnologies <br />2. Impact/cost measures and impacted industry segments, selected based on hypothesized significance of impact and feasibility of obtaining impact data directly from industry<br />3. Impact/cost measures must be constructed to allow (a) aggregation to sector-wide estimates of underinvestment in relevant technology platform and infratechnology categories, and (b) independent evaluation by NIST.<br />4. Final selection of industries in the relevant supply chains projected to be associated with the emerging technologies in the case study<br />REPORT REQUIREMENTS: The Contractor shall produce a report that presents the case study embodying technology and industry trends and gap assessments and the economic analysis framework.</p>
<p>PHASE II: This is an OPTIONAL LINE ITEM. It may not be exercised at time of award. The Government will reserve the right to exercise at a later date.</p>
<p>Upon the fully executed modification to exercise this option,</p>

<DESC><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Description</strong><br /></span><br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition.

An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br />Background<br /></strong><br /></span>The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) is a block grant program authorized by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, as amended, and is administered within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). In HHS, LIHEAP is administered by the Office of Community Services (OCS) in the Administration for Children and Families (ACF). The purpose of LIHEAP is to provide grants to states, territories, Indian tribes and tribal organizations to assist low income households in meeting the costs of residential energy.<br /><br />The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Act of l981 (Title XXVI of Public Law 97-35, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 8621) in section 2609A (a) authorizes the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to set aside up to $300,000 each fiscal year to make grants, interagency agreements, contracts and jointly financed cooperative arrangements with states, public agencies, and private nonprofit organizations to provide training and technical assistance relating to LIHEAP. The Continuing Appropriation Act of 2015 amended this to allow up to nearly $3 million for grants and contracts for technical assistance, training, and monitoring of program activities for compliance with internal controls, policies and procedures, and eliminated the restriction of making contracts to only states, public agencies and private non-profit organizations. <br /><br />LIHEAP allows states, tribes and territories to develop energy assistance and, at their option weatherization assistance, that best meet the needs of their low income populations. Consequently, LIHEAP varies greatly in program design and implementation strategies. It is important for federal LIHEAP grantees to share their unique programs and innovative ideas so new and different policies and practices can be replicated to enhance programs. It is also important for grantees to have access to evaluations and research to help them administer effective programs.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose<br /></span><br /></strong>The purpose of this contract is to provide a LIHEAP Clearinghouse which will be responsible to collect, develop, organize and disseminate information on LIHEAP at the grantee and subgrantee levels, current energy issues and trends, other low income energy assistance programs, other programs that affect LIHEAP-eligible clients and other relevant information of interest to OCS and LIHEAP grantees. This information shall primarily be shared via the LIHEAP Clearinghouse web site which the contractor will maintain.<br />The Clearinghouse will provide technical assistance and information through a dedicated toll-free telephone number, an OCS hosted web site, an email address, a mailing address, electronic newsletters and other written correspondence as directed by OCS. Clearinghouse information will be available to OCS, LIHEAP grantees, their sub-contractors and sub-grantees, including other OCS grantees such as Community Actions Agencies, the public and other interested parties.<br />The Clearinghouse will also provide a National Energy Assistance Referral (NEAR) Service that refers those in the general public who are interested in applying for LIHEAP to the proper LIHEAP intake office and other assistance agencies.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Project Requirements<br /></span></strong><br />The LIHEAP Clearinghouse awardee shall:</p>
<p>&bull; Collect, develop and disseminate information regarding the LIHEAP program, other energy-related information including the ongoing national trend towards utility restructuring, information affecting OCS/LIHEAP clients, and other information as deemed necessary by the OCS Contracting Officer's Representative (COR);<br /><br />&bull; Provide a dedicated telephone number and an E-mail address so that OCS and LIHEAP grantees may contact the Clearinghouse with questions and requests for information;<br /><br />&bull; Provide a National Energy Assistance Referral Service<br /><br />&bull; Provide a quarterly electronic bulletin with research findings<br /><br />&bull; Develop and update online interactive training modules for self-paced education by LIHEAP grantees about LIHEAP and LIHEAP- related topics.<br /><br />&bull; Maintain an OCS hosted Internet Website with research findings, trends, NEAR service access, and other information relevant to LIHEAP.<br /><br />&bull; Represent the Clearinghouse at home energy-related conferences and meetings and present information about the Clearinghouse, LIHEAP and LIHEAP-related issues.<br /><br />&bull; Provide technical assistance to grantees on the LIHEAP program. LIHEAP Grantees include State, Tribal, and Territory governments as well as Tribal Organizations. Technical assistance includes responding to questions by email, telephone and through LIHEAP training events about federal requirements, examples of grantee program variations, and other related issues.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Period of Performance<br /></span></strong><br />The anticipated Period of Performance (POP)&nbsp;is March 15, 2015 - March 14, 2016 with one (1) base year and two (2) one year option periods.</p>

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT ONLY.
<p>Sources are sought for the economic viability, and capability and availability of potential parties interested in public-private partnerships for dredging and sediment management within the Great Lakes region. Great Lakes harbors and channels support the country as the 4th largest economic zone in North America. Maritime transportation infrastructure in the scope of this notice includes federally authorized, high use, commercial harbors as well as low use, commercial and recreational harbors; which provide the foundation for billions of dollars of revenue regionally. Industry, manufacturers, shippers and consumers need reliable and well maintained waterways on the Great Lakes.</p>
<p>The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) has the responsibility to operate and maintain 140 federally authorized harbors and channels on the Great Lakes (see attachments and hyperlinks for listings of federal project locations, project overviews and hydrographic and condition surveys ; and, the Great Lakes System Navigation Projects and Harbors). In addition, USACE operates 20 confined disposal facilities (CDFs) (see attachment for list of Active CDFs in the Great Lakes Region). We are seeking fiscally economical means to fully maintain the maritime navigation system to authorized dimensions; particularly, the low use commercial and recreational harbors. Further, some of the commercial harbors are running out of CDF capacity for dredged material in cases where beneficial use, near-shore placement or open water placement is not feasible. Extending the life of these CDFs will enhance the ability to maintain the maritime navigation system. In the past, dredged material has been considered a waste product; however, dredged material is a valuable resource with many beneficial uses as evidenced by recent innovative applications.</p>
<p>USACE is seeking interested parties to generate ideas and/or participate in public-private partnerships to better maintain Great Lakes navigable waterways in a long-term sustainable manner with reliable public and/or private investment. Improving navigation maintenance throughout the Great Lakes requires dredging of federally authorized channels as well as providing safe, appropriately engineered and environmentally sound methods of placement of dredged sediment. Specifically, USACE is seeking responses to ascertain interest and feasibility of exploring a host of solutions to the following three (3) challenges:</p>
<p>&bull;Dredging maintains navigation channels, harbors and ports that are critical to the economic and cultural viability of communities within the Great Lakes region; however, there is a growing backlog of maintenance dredging within the Great Lakes region.<br /><br />&bull;Dredged material is generally treated as a waste product; which may be used as a valuable resource with many potential benefits.<br /><br />&bull;USACE is currently responsible for the operation of 20 Confined Disposal Facilities (CDFs) in the Great Lakes region. CDFs' capacities are steadily decreasing and will eventually become unusable as an alternative for disposal of dredged material. The cost to create new CDFs for disposal of dredged material is high. Extending the operational life of the existing system and facilities could potentially be more cost effective, and filled CDFs may also have potential uses.<br /><br />USACE is particularly interested in projects that can be executed under current federal and state laws and policies.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: This Sources Sought Notice is issued solely for informational, collaborative and planning purposes. It does not constitute a solicitation (Request for Proposal or Request for Quotations) or a promise to issue a solicitation in the future.</p>
<p>USACE is seeking interested parties who have innovative ideas or potential solutions to one or more of the identified challenges above that may be implemented at one or more of the sites identified in the attachments herein.

Synopsis:

The purpose of this RFI is to determine if the government should pursue a separate independently competed contract action for the required services, or pursue an Economy Act Interagency Agreement with the Department of Defense to utilize their existing contract holder for similar services.   Currently DOD has a contractor in place performing identical work on just the DOD side.  REF: Far Part 17.502-2:

17.502-2 - The Economy Act.
(a) The Economy Act (31 U.S.C. 1535) authorizes agencies to enter into agreements to obtain supplies or services from another agency. The FAR applies when one agency uses another agency' contract to obtain supplies or services. If the interagency business transaction does not result in a contract or an order, then the FAR does not apply. The Economy Act also provides authority for placement of orders between major organizational units within an agency; procedures for such intra-agency transactions are addressed in agency regulations.
(b) The Economy Act applies when more specific statutory authority does not exist. Examples of more specific authority are 40 U.S.C. 501 for the Federal Supply Schedules (subpart 8.4), and 40 U.S.C. 11302(e) for Governmentwide acquisition contracts (GWACs).
(c) Requirements for determinations and findings.
(1) Each Economy Act order to obtain supplies or services by interagency acquisition shall be supported by a determination and findings (D&F). The D&F shall-
(i) State that use of an interagency acquisition is in the best interest of the Government; 
(ii) State that the supplies or services cannot be obtained as conveniently or economically by contracting directly with a private source;


This RFI will be used in support of the procurement direction this office takes on this effort.

THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION. This is a Request for Information (RFI)/Sources Sought notice issued in accordance with FAR 15.201(e) to conduct market research. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Quote (RFQ) - or a promise to issue a RFQ in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or services whatsoever. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is not, at this time, seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested vendor's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFQ, if any is issued. Any information submitted by respondents to this RFI is strictly voluntary. All submissions become Government property and will NOT be returned. This announcement is based upon the best information available and is subject to future modification.

<DESC>The United States Air Force, AFLCMC/Operational Contracting Branch, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433-5344. This is a Sole Source synopsis published for informational purposes only. This proposed action is for the procurement of Regenerative Tissues. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).
<p>This proposed procurement will be a Sole Source under North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 339113 - Surgical Appliance and Supplies Manufacturing. Business size standard is for NAICS 339113 is 500 employees.</p>
<p>The proposed source is Lifecell Corporation, 1 Millennium Way, Branchburg, NJ, 08876-3876. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, quotation or exception to the intent to purchase on a sole source basis, which shall be considered by the Government if received by 10:00 am Local (Wright-Patterson AFB) Time, Tuesday, 13 Jan 15. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>In order to comply with FAR 5.207(c)(15), the reason for lack of competition is as follows: The U.S. Air Force requires FDA-approved, implantable, regenerative tissue products of various sizes and thicknesses&nbsp;for use during certain procedures at the Wright -Patterson Medical Treatment Facility. Accordingly, Lifecell is the only known source capable of providing these supplies without the U.S. Air Force experiencing unacceptable delays in fulfilling its requirements.</p>
<p>The Department of Defense (DoD) has determined the System for Award Management (SAM) to be the single DoD registration for contractors who conduct business or who are interested in conducting business with the DoD. Contractors must be registered in SAM prior to award for solicitations issued after 29 May 2012. You may contact SAM by telephone at 866-606-8220 or online at https://www.sam.gov.</p>

<DESC>This is to notify the public of the Government's intent to make a sole source award for the Main Operating Room (MOR) at Naval Medical Center Portsmouth (NMCP). This sole source award is for miscellaneous mattress pads,that the hospital has deemed necessary for proper patient care. The pads are required to replace the current damaged mattresses which pose a high risk of infection during surgery. The supplies are very specific to the MOR operational needs and are what is required for MOR to satisfy its mission at NMCP. Any deviation from the specifications of these products will increase risk to the patient and is unacceptable to the Government.
<p>Sole source documents are attached to special notice.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Contracts Management Office (CMO) intends to award a sole source contract to Mr. David M. Breen, Sole Proprietor, for a period of one (1) twelve-month base period, and four (4) twelve-month option periods.  This is a sole source synopsis for the acquisition of commercial items in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 13.5 "Test Program for Certain Commercial Items".  The applicable NAICS code is 541611, with a size standard of $15 million.  The dollar value for this contract action is estimated at approximately $611,638 including options.  This will be a Labor Hour type contract to provide services on a part-time basis in support of business systems for DARPA's CMO to include the following: Standard Procurement System, Procurement Desktop Defense 2, eTriever, and Broad Agency Announcement Maker.  Other Direct Costs (ODCs) will be accounted for with a time and materials (T&amp;M) type contract line item (CLIN).  The contractor will oversee the design, development, testing, documentation, implementation, support, and maintenance of DARPA's contract writing and administration software tools.  The contractor will support the planning and implementation of electronic interfaces with other DARPA and Department of Defense business systems.  The contractor will assist with the planning, testing, and implementation of new contract writing tool upgrades and versions.<br />&nbsp;<br />This is a special notice for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Part 12.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements".  Mr. Breen has over 26 years of systems implementation experience and has been supporting the implementation of CMO Business Systems since 2001.  Prior to supporting CMO, he was the project manager for the DARPA Comptroller implementation of the financial management system called Momentum, and the Momentum executive information system called Momentum Monitor.  Mr. Breen's knowledge of DARPA specific financial systems coupled with his institutional knowledge of CMO's business systems uniquely qualifies him to meet the Government's requirement for business systems support services.<br /><br />This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation for this specific requirement is currently available.  In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(16)(ii), all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, which shall be considered by DARPA.  Capability statements may be submitted to Contracting Officer, Jimmy Hupalar, at jimmy.hupalar@darpa.mil, no later than 3:00 PM EST January 23, 2015.  A determination by the Government not to compete the requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely at the discretion of the Government.  Questions related to this proposed contract action should be directed to jimmy.hupalar@darpa.mil.

<DESC>The United States Department of Transportation, Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), Office of Acquisition Services, under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Rules (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Envisions Consulting LLC of Falls Church, VA for facilitation services for strategic planning sessions for FRA's Office of Railroad Policy.
<p>The justification is as follows. Envisions Consulting has developed expertise in FRA's strategic vision and established&nbsp;relationships of trust&nbsp;that cannot be duplicated by another contractor without expending additional time and resources&nbsp;for redundant services. Indeed, for the strategic planning facilitation services to be successful, they require building&nbsp;this sort of&nbsp;relationship of trust with key members of FRA's team. This allows for the open communication needed to accomplish the work. Successful performance of these services by another contractor would entail, essentially, repeating previously completed sessions in order for that contractor to gain the requisite institutional knowledge and to build the relationships of trust that are required, meaning employing excessive government time and resources.</p>
<p>NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE IS AVAILABLE. Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting this requirement may submit a response, which if received by the closing date of this announcement, will be considered. Responses to this announcement must be in writing to the Contract Specialist, Ryan Daniels, at ryan.daniels@dot.gov.</p>

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]<br />(1) Listed End Product<br />Listed End Product: Listed Countries of Origin:<br /><br /><br /><br />(2) Certification.

On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor.<br />(j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly-<br />(1) [_] In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or <br />(2) [_] Outside the United States.<br />(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Labor Standards. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.]<br />(1) [_] Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [_] does [_] does not certify that-<br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations;<br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and<br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers.<br />(2) [_] Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1).

(Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to the SAM database to be eligible for award.)<br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).<br />(2) The TIN may be used by the government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)). If the resulting contract is subject to the payment reporting requirements described in FAR 4.904, the TIN provided hereunder may be matched with IRS records to verify the accuracy of the offeror's TIN.<br />(3) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN).<br />[_] TIN:_____________________.<br />[_] TIN has been applied for.<br />[_] TIN is not required because:<br />[_] Offeror is a nonresident alien, foreign corporation, or foreign partnership that does not have income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States and does not have an office or place of business or a fiscal paying agent in the United States;<br />[_] Offeror is an agency or instrumentality of a foreign government;<br />[_] Offeror is an agency or instrumentality of the Federal Government;<br />(4) Type of organization.<br />[_] Sole proprietorship;<br />[_] Partnership;<br />[_] Corporate entity (not tax-exempt);<br />[_] Corporate entity (tax-exempt);<br />[_] Government entity (Federal, State, or local);<br />[_] Foreign government;<br />[_] International organization per 26 CFR 1.6049-4;<br />[_] Other ____________________.<br />(5) Common parent.<br />[_] Offeror is not owned or controlled by a common parent:<br />[_] Name and TIN of common parent:<br />Name ____________________________________<br />TIN ______________________________________<br />(m) Restricted business operations in Sudan.

(3) Commercial vehicles less than 12'-5" in height shall access Joint Base Lewis-North ONLY via the Pendleton Avenue under-crossing once they are cleared through the Logistics Center Gate or the DuPont Gate, as appropriate. <BR> <BR>THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS PROVIDED TO ASSIST YOU, AND WILL HELP TO EXPEDITE PAPERWORK AND PAYMENT.
     a. Only one delivery will be accepted against each line item.  Backorders will NOT be accepted on individual line items.     b. Deliver on or before date specified.  Deliveries will be accepted Monday through Friday (except Holidays) from 7:30 A.M. to 2:30 P.M. to Block 15 of the Purchase Order.

All items will be identified by the part number by attached tag and/or stamped identification.     d. On direct shipments, have the supplier or manufacturer cite our order number on packages.  This eliminates delay caused by trying to determine the firm awarded the original order. <BR> <BR>Unless otherwise specified in this contract, the contractor shall obtain any necessary licenses and permits, give all notices, and comply with any applicable Federal, State, County, and municipal laws, codes, and regulations in connection with this award. <BR> <BR>The contractor shall not make news releases or otherwise provide information relative to the performance of this contract or information relative to any incident occurring on JBLM without prior approval of the Contracting Officer. <BR> <BR>

<p>MICrONS seeks to revolutionize machine learning by reverse-engineering the algorithms of the brain. The program is expressly designed as a dialogue between data science and neuroscience. Participants in the program will have the unique opportunity to pose biological questions with the greatest potential to advance theories of neural computation and obtain answers through carefully planned experimentation and data analysis. Over the course of the program, participants will use their improving understanding of the representations, transformations, and learning rules employed by the brain to create ever more capable neurally-derived machine learning algorithms. Ultimate computational goals for MICrONS include the ability to perform complex information processing tasks such as one-shot learning, unsupervised clustering, and scene parsing, aiming towards human-like proficiency.</p>
<p>Despite significant progress in machine learning over the past few years, today's state of the art algorithms are brittle and do not generalize well. In contrast, the brain is able to robustly separate and categorize signals in the presence of significant noise and non-linear transformations, and can extrapolate from single examples to entire classes of stimuli. This performance gap between software and wetware persists despite some correspondence between the architecture of the leading machine learning algorithms and their biological counterparts in the brain, presumably because the two still differ significantly in the details of operation.</p>
<p>The MICrONS program aims to achieve a quantum leap in machine learning by creating novel machine learning algorithms that use neurally-inspired architectures and mathematical abstractions of the representations, transformations, and learning rules employed by the brain. To guide the construction of these algorithms, performers will conduct targeted neuroscience experiments that interrogate the operation of mesoscale cortical computing circuits, taking advantage of emerging tools for high-resolution structural and functional brain mapping. The program is designed to facilitate iterative refinement of algorithms based on a combination of practical, theoretical, and experimental outcomes: performers will use their experiences with the algorithms' design and performance to reveal gaps in their understanding of cortical computation, and will collect specific neuroscience data to inform new algorithmic implementations that address these limitations. Ultimately, as performers incorporate these insights into successive versions of the machine learning algorithms, they will devise solutions that can achieve human-like performance on complex information processing tasks with human-like proficiency.</p>
<p>MICrONS is organized in three phases, totaling five years in duration. During each phase, performers conduct targeted neuroanatomical and neurophysiological studies to inform their understanding of the cortical computations underlying sensory information processing and, concurrently, create neurally-derived machine learning algorithms that perform similar functions. Performers motivate their experimental and algorithmic designs by formulating and updating a conceptual model or "theoretical framework" for neural information processing in a given sensory modality. They use computational neural models to establish a correspondence between the computations performed by biological wetware and the computations employed by their machine learning software. Each phase ends with an information processing challenge that assesses how well the new algorithms perform on increasingly challenging machine learning tasks: similarity discrimination in Phase 1, generalization and classification in Phase 2, and invariant recognition in Phase 3. Performers use the results of their experiments in each phase to guide their development of improved algorithms in the subsequent phase (in Phase 1, performers base their algorithms on the existing neuroscience literature).</p>
<p>The MICrONS program comprises three Technical Areas (TAs):<br />TA1 - experimental design, theoretical neuroscience, computational neural modeling, machine learning, neurophysiological data collection, and data analysis;<br />TA2 - neuroanatomical data collection; and<br />TA3 - reconstruction of cortical circuits from neuroanatomical data and development of information technology systems to store, align, and access neural circuit reconstructions with the associated neurophysiological and neuroanatomical data.</p>
<p>Although IARPA anticipates receiving a number of holistic proposals responding to all three TAs, it recognizes that some prospective offerors may have capabilities in only a subset of the overall program scope, and wishes to maximize its opportunity to leverage these capabilities. Therefore, offerors may choose to propose to one, two, or all three TAs.</p>

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>"Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>

<p>(2) Prospective contractor-submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR subpart 4.12; and</p>

<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>

<p>(1) A code assigned by the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) to identify a commercial or Government entity; or</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p>a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br /><br />Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA <br /><br />(End of provision)</p>

The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code into the SAM database; and</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>

The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.  <br>  <br> (2)  <br>  <br> (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name,  quote mark doing business as quote mark  name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to: <br>  <br> (A) Change the name in the SAM database;  <br>  <br> (B) Comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; <br>  <br> (C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the  quote mark Suspension of payment quote mark  paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. <br>  <br> (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov. <br>  <br> (u) Unauthorized Obligations.  <br>  <br> (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End Use License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: <br>  <br> (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. <br>  <br> (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an  quote mark I agree quote mark  click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g.,  quote mark click-wrap quote mark  or  quote mark browse-wrap quote mark  agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. <br>  <br> (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. <br>  <br> (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. <br>  <br> (v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractor's representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract. <br>  <br> (End of Clause) <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> TECHNICAL INQUIRIES AND QUESTIONS   <br>  <br> Technical inquiries and questions relating to this solicitation are to be submitted via Bidder Inquiry in ProjNet at (https://www.projnet.org) .

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

Destination Only. <BR> <BR>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

The AOAP laboratories are located throughout the world with eight CONUS and two OCONUS regional locations.   The potential Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) requirement will provide for personnel to operate, train and maintain both fixed-based and mobile laboratories in the CONUS and OCONUS.       <br>              <br>     Please see Attachment.          <br>     No Phone Calls Please.

Evidence shall include a signed agreement between the vendor and the quoter. Quotes that fail to provide such evidence shall be deemed technically unacceptable and will not be considered for award.

<p><br />Quotes will be evaluated based on the hotel's ability to meet the solicitation requirements, quality of meeting space proposed, guest room price, wifi costs and comps offered. The basis for award will be based on best value. As the difference in quoters services become more equal, price and concessions will be the determining factor in the award decision.</p>

A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <BR> <BR>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ? 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <BR> <BR>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <BR> <BR>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ? 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<DESC><p><strong>SYNOPSIS:</strong> AFLCMC/WIN manages the USAF Imaging &amp; Targeting Support (I&amp;TS) portfolio supporting the Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) Capabilities Working Group (GCWG). The GCWG manages and plans Air Force airborne GEOINT Capabilities Research, Development Test and Evaluation investments. The I&amp;TS portfolio is a key resource of the GCWG. The I&amp;TS portfolio identifies and provides limited funding to develop and demonstrate promising next-generation Air Force airborne GEOINT capabilities. The key focus of I&amp;TS is on the airborne sensor phenomenologies which include Electro/Optical, Infrared, Spectral-Multispectral/Hyperspectral Imaging, Ground Surveillance Radar, Full Motion Video, Light Detection and Ranging, and on-board processing/exploitation of sensor data.</p>
<p><strong>PURPOSE:</strong> In support of the I&amp;TS program, AFLCMC/WIN is conducting market research across industry, academia and government agency programs. The intent is to identify promising candidate programs/technology efforts with projected capabilities that may improve current and future Air Force airborne GEOINT sensors and their role in enhancing the front side of end-to-end-functionality as well as identifying potential transition paths. Market research will help identify what research has been accomplished in the field of GEOINT, as well as technologies that currently exist or could be modified to fill a need. Although FY16 funding is uncertain, I&amp;TS managers are seeking <br />1 - 2 year projects beginning in FY16 that require funding of less than $3 million per year with Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 4 or 5. AFLCMC/WIN seeks white papers and quad charts by&nbsp;<strong>23 January 2015</strong>. All correspondence submitted will be protected and controlled as proprietary. After reviewing the submitted white papers and quad charts, the Government may request technical exchanges and/or site surveys of respondents' facilities. This market research will potentially shape Air Force efforts in the FY16-24 timeframe. The Government anticipates the information received will be used to plan and program the required efforts to support airborne GEOINT objectives. I&amp;TS candidates will be presented to the GCWG in the spring of 2015 for consideration.</p>

<span><span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2&nbsp;Dec 14</span></strong></span></span>
<p>The formal Request for Proposal (RFP)&nbsp;for CFT has been posted to FBO. There are 21 attachments to the RFP.</p>
<p>Some of the content contained within the RFP (and its attachments) is different than what was provided during the Q&amp;A process. All documents have been updated and/or revised since the Q&amp;A phase. Offerors are suggested to consider the Q&amp;A as a guide only; the formal RFP (and its attachments) supersedes all previous postings. Offerors need to carefully review the RFP (and its attachments) for the applicable due dates and&nbsp;instructions for submitting proposals.<br />__________________________________________________________</p>
<span><span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Previously Posted Information<br /><br /></span></strong></span></span>
<p>9 Oct 14 - FORMAL SYNOPSIS - Contract Field Teams (CFT)<span><span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br /></span></strong></span></span><br />This announcement constitutes a Formal Synopsis for the Contract Field Teams (CFT) program located at Tinker AFB.</p>
<p>The Government seeks to award approximately 13 Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts in two (2) competition pools:</p>
<p>(1) Full and Open competition pool: Approximately six (6) ID/IQ contracts to either Small or Large Businesses competing in the Full and Open competition pool whose offers represent the best value to the Government. <br />(2) Small Business Set-Aside competition pool: Approximately seven (7) ID/IQ contracts to Small Businesses competing in the Small Business Set-Aside competition pool whose offers represent the best value to the Government.</p>
<p>Note: Offerors competing in the Small Business Set-Aside competition pool may elect to compete in the Full and Open competition pool. Small Businesses will be evaluated in the appropriate competition pool(s) based on the offeror's selection located on the front page of the formal RFP (when released).</p>
<p>The Air Force will acquire this requirement through an Air Force Source Selection.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that the resultant contracts will be FAR Part 15 ID/IQ contracts with Firm Fixed Price, Time &amp; Material, and Cost-Reimbursable line items. This is a non-commercial acquisition.</p>
<p>The contract ordering period will consist of a maximum seven years and six months. The basic period will be three-years (ends year 3), Option I will be two-years (ends year 5), and Option II will be two-years (ends year 7). The options will be priced at the time of contract award. At the end of any contract period, FAR clause 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, allows for continued services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract. This clause will be incorporated and evaluated at the time of basic contract award. The solicitation and contract will expressly state that the clause at 52.217-8 may be used for additional ordering period (up to six months) at the end of any contract period and that the NTE rates specified in the contract for the ordering period existing at the time 52.217-8 is exercised will apply to the task orders issued during the new ordering period under the Option to Extend Services. Each task order will state a period of performance for the services ordered and may include clause 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, so long as it is incorporated and evaluated at the time the task order is issued.</p>
<p>This is a partial Small Business Set-Aside under NAICS Code 336411.</p>
<p>The Line Item Description will be as follows:<br />X001 - Firm Fixed Price (FFP) <br />X002 - Overtime in support of FFP (FP) <br />X003 - Surge (FP) <br />X004 - Over and Above (FFP)<br />X005 - CAP/CAS (CR)<br />X006 - Time and Materials (T&amp;M)<br />X007 - Overtime in support of T&amp;M (T&amp;M)<br />X008 - Material/Non-Material (T&amp;M)<br />X009 - Travel (CR)<br />X010 - Transition In (FFP)<br />X011 - Transition Out (FFP)<br />X012 - Data (NSP)<br />X013 - Post Award Conference (CR)</p>
<p>Deliveries and locations will be cited on individual task orders. FOB Origin and Destination.</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to establish a competitive, performance based service acquisition (PBSA) for Contract Field Team (CFT) support. CFTs are available for use by all the Department of Defense (DoD) services and other federal agencies. A CFT is an awarded set of Contractor maintenance personnel who are provided with Government-furnished special tools, equipment, work space and supplies to accomplish modification/maintenance/repair effort on-site at operational Government locations, both in the Continental United States (CONUS) and outside the Continental United States (OCONUS). The CFT program accomplishes depot, field and organizational level inspection, maintenance, modification and repair at operational Government locations worldwide. The program supports requirements for the active Air Force, Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve components. CFT contracts are also used to support requirements generated by the Army, Navy, Coast Guard, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Department of Homeland Security and other federal agencies. The CFT program provides a rapid deployment workforce augmentation capability to field necessary skilled technicians on site anywhere in the world to support the Government's war readiness needs.</p>
<p>All award eligibility requirements will be stated in the RFP.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency. Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation through FedBizOps at http://www.fbo.gov. Solicitation requests can be submitted to Wade Ward via email at bradley.ward.3@us.af.mil and Melony Adamski at melony.adamski.1@us.af.mil.</p>
<p>Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at 405-736-3273. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.<span><span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br /><br />___________________________________________________________<br /><br />Previously Posted Information<br /><br /></span></strong>2 Jul 14 - Follow-up Q&amp;A<br /><br />Attached is the follow-up Q&amp;A derived from the original Q&amp;A posted on 29 May 14.

<DESC><p>SOLICITATION NOTICE. THIS PROCUREMENT IS 100% SET-ASIDE FOR HUBZONE FIRMS.</p>
<p>THIS IS&nbsp;A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL</p>
<p>The Government intends to secure services, labor, and material for construction, additions, alterations, maintenance, and repairs at the various buildings and structures at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, Charleston, South Carolina, through the issuance of individual task orders under ONE Indefinite Delivery/ Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall furnish, for the basic contract and each individual task order issued thereunder, all labor, transportation, materials, equipment, supervision, and quality control, necessary to perform the required construction, maintenance, and alterations. The contract duration will be a base period of 12 months from the date of award with four 12 month option periods with an additional 6-month extension in accordance with FAR 52.217-8 to be exercised at the Government's discretion.</p>
<p>The contract will have a guaranteed minimum of $50,000.00 with a maximum estimated value of Not-to-Exceed $16,500,000.00 for the life of the contract. The estimated execution per year for planning purposes is approximately $3,000,000.00. This is for planning purposes only and is NOT guaranteed. Task Orders will typically range from $1,000.00 to $1,000,000.00, and may involve a variety of trades including but not limited to architectural, mechanical, civil, structural, roofing, demolition, electrical, environmental support, carpentry, roadwork, painting, plumbing, and masonry.

Non-price factors consist of Technical (Factor A Key Personnel and Factor B Management Approach) and Factor C Past Performance, which when combined, are approximately equal in weight to price.</p>
<p>The Government contemplates award of ONE firm fixed price construction contract resulting from this solicitation. Individual task order pricing will be based on pre-established prices in place contained in the RS. Means Facility Construction Cost Data book, adjusted by the Charleston, SC City Cost Index Multiplier, using the sum total of the bare costs for labor, material, and equipment. The contractor's coefficient shall be applied to the total of the adjusted bare costs.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of interested parties to regularly check the website (www.fbo.gov) for posting of the solicitation and its subsequent amendments (if applicable). The Government is anticipating significant subcontracting opportunities with this procurement.</p>

<p><br /><strong>Location:<br /></strong>National, Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Rockledge Dr. Bethesda Maryland</p>
<p><strong>Title:<br /></strong>Maintenance Service Plan Chameleon System Ultra II</p>
<p><strong>Description(s):<br /></strong>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisitions (OA), on behalf of the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR), intends to negotiate and award a Purchase Order on a noncompetitive, sole source basis, to Coherent, Inc, 5100 Patrick Henry Drive, Santa Clara, CA, 95054, for procurement of maintenance services for the NIDCR owned Chameleon System Ultra II.</p>
<p><strong>Background:<br /><br /></strong>The National Institute of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting, supporting and making medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The Oral Pharyngeal Cancer Branch (OPCB) conducts basic research on the normal and aberrant functions of tissues, cells and molecules as they relate to oral disease and other disease states, placing a special emphasis on the etiology, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of oral tumors. The OPCB has a requirement for maintenance services for their Chameleon System Ultra II.</p>
<p><strong>Statement of Work:</strong></p>
<p>The Contractor Shall:</p>
<p><strong>Task 1:</strong> Provide all labor, material and equipment to provide preventive maintenance for government-owned Chameleon System serial# GDP.1119305.2091. All maintenance services shall be performed in accordance with the manufacturer's standard commercial maintenance practices.</p>
<p><strong>Task 2:</strong> Emergency repair services shall be provided on an unlimited basis during the term of this contract at no additional cost to the government. Emergency service shall be provided between 8 am and 5 pm Monday through Friday excluding and Federal holidays. Upon receipt of notice that any part of the equipment is not functioning properly, the Contractor shall furnish a qualified factory-trained service representative to inspect the equipment and perform all repairs and adjustments necessary to restore the equipment to normal and efficient operating condition. Emergency service calls shall not replace the necessity for PMI.</p>
<p><strong>Task 3:</strong> The contractor shall furnish all required replacement parts at no additional cost to the Government, with the exception of consumable items such as batteries and light bulbs. Parts shall be new or remanufactured to original equipment specifications.</p>
<p><strong>Task 4:</strong> The contractor shall provide Software Service in accordance with the manufacturer's latest established service procedures, to include telephone access to technical support for use of program software and trouble shooting of the operating systems, at no additional cost to the Government. The contractor shall receive advance approval for the installation of all software updates/upgrades and revisions from the Government. Defective software shall be replaced at no additional cost to the Government.</p>
<p><strong>Period of Performance:<br /></strong>Base Year: 01/19/2015 -01/18/2016<br />Option Year 1: 01/19/2016 -01/18/2017<br />Option Year 2: 01/19/2017 -01/18/2018<br />Option Year 3: 01/19/2018 -01/18/2019<br />Option Year 4: 01/19/2019 -01/18/2020</p>
<p><strong>Additional Requirements:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1:</strong> The contractor shall not be responsible for any repairs necessitated by abuse, neglect, vandalism, Acts of God, fire or water. These repairs shall be the subject of a separate purchase order and shall not be performed under this contract.</p>
<p><strong>2:</strong> Personnel shall be factory trained and have experience in the servicing aforementioned instrument. All primary service personnel shall have at least one backup Field Service representative with at least the same level of expertise on the equipment covered by this contract.<br /><br /><strong>Sole Source Justification:<br /></strong><br />The OPCB at the NIDCR currently owns the subject Chameleon System Ultra II. Coherent currently provides routine maintenance on the Lab's Chameleon System. Coherent is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and is the only company that can provide a maintenance agreement to the manufacturer's specifications while providing OEM parts for it. Without a proper maintenance agreement, the System would become inoperable, resulting in time lost due to inoperability and the loss of work hours on the experiments the system supports, while possibly jeopardizing said experiments.

<DESC>AMENDMENT#00004 IS TO PROVIDE A FINAL ANSWER TO THE QUESTION THAT WAS SUBMITTED IN WRITING TO THE CONTRACTING OFFICER. 

The National Park Service, Point Reyes National Seashore, has a requirement for a Project Manager who will be responsible for the management of design, fabrication, and installation of new exhibits to be installed into new 405 sf interpretive space located at the Point Reyes Lighthouse.

The program manager will monitor the construction of the building, oversee the fabrication and installation of the exhibits, and suggest adjustments as necessary to exhibits installation to preserve the design integrity and intent of the contract documents and specifications. 

The Government intends to award a single, fixed price service contract. The Request for Quotation (RFQ) will include one base line item (covering work Item 1-7), and two option items, which are SUBJECT TO AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS. The period of performance for base and option item work is estimated to be February 2, 2015 through August 31, 2015.

Award selection will be based on the responsible firm whose offer conforming to this RFQ will be most advantageous to the Government, on the basis of the lowest evaluated price meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non-cost factors (technical capability and past performance). 

The North American Standard Industrial Classifications System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541611, with a corresponding size standard of $15.0 million in annual gross receipts for the past three years.  

This acquisition is a Total Small Business Set-Aside. Offers are solicited only from small business concerns. Offers received from concerns that are not small business shall be considered nonresponsive and will be rejected. 

The Request for Quotation (RFQ) will be available on/about December 18, 2014 by electronic means only and can be downloaded along with all related attachments from the FedBizOpps website at http://www.fbo.gov and/or FedConnect website at http://www.fedconnect.net. The RFQ will close fifteen days from the actual date of issuance. Interested parties are responsible for periodically checking the website for any Amendments that may be issued prior to the closing date of the RFQ. 

QUOTES ARE DUE MONDAY, JANUARY 5, 2015 AT 4:30 P.M. (Pacific Standard Time)

<p>NAVAIR received 17 responses to the referenced Sources Sought and the following general analysis is provided for your information:<br /><br />9 Large Businesses (8 capable)<br />2 Small Businesses (0 capable)<br />1 HUBZone Small Business and Veteran-Owned Small Business (0 capable)<br />1 Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (1 capable)<br />3 Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (2 capable)<br />1 Woman-Owned Small Business (0 capable)</p>
<p>The Procuring Contracting Officer analyzed the Government's market research, of which this Sources Sought was a component, and determined a set-aside for Small Businesses is appropriate to have adequate competition. The NAVAIR Office of Small Business concurred with this determination.</p>
<p>Regardless of the Sources Sought results, the capability assessment does not pre-determine an offeror's qualifications for future competition. All companies are eligible to submit a proposal in response to a NAVAIR solicitation for services described in the Sources Sought referenced herein - as long as the company meets the designated size standards.</p>
<p>Questions regarding this determination may be referred to the Contract Specialist, Deborah Karstens, at e-mail Deborah.Karstens@navy.mil; however, the Government will not be meeting with any potential offerors and will not provide additional information on its capability determinations at this time. An Industry Day will be held, with an anticipated date in mid-February, to answer specific questions. Details will be posted in FedBizOpps.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command has a requirement for the execution of work during the USS HARRY S. TRUMAN (CVN 75) Continuous Incremental Availability (CIA) at Norfolk Naval Shipyard from late 2014 to early 2015.&nbsp; CIA efforts include manpower, support services, design integration, engineering and management support, and technical data required to prepare for and accomplish this work during the availability.&nbsp; The work to be accomplished will include repair or replacement of shipboard nuclear propulsion components or systems along with installation of applicable Ship Change Documents.
<p>The requirement will be procured, without full and open competition, from the only qualified source capable of performing the CIA work for the USS HARRY S. TRUMAN (CVN 75) nuclear-powered aircraft carrier.&nbsp; Because of the unique certifications, capabilities, and expertise required to work on nuclear propulsion and other specialized systems (e.g. catapults, arresting gear, CIWS, etc.), the Government does not anticipate significant subcontracting opportunities for this requirement. &nbsp;Firms interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact Huntington Ingalls Incorporated - Newport News Shipbuilding directly.&nbsp; This synopsis is being posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at https: <a href="http://www.fbo.gov">www.fbo.gov</a>. &nbsp;FBO is the single point of entry for the posting of synopsis and solicitations to the Internet.</p>

<DESC>The US Army Corps of Engineers, Detroit District, plans to solicit for a design/build construction contract for an Energy Optimization Project, located at the Soo Locks, Sault Ste Marie, Michigan. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code applicable to this requirement is 238220.   <br>    <br>  The phase one solicitation is expected to be available in Dec 2014. A contract award is expected in March/April 2015.   <br>    <br>  The work consists of, but is not limited to, the following:   <br>    <br>  The majority of the project involves heating system and lighting upgrades to the Maintenance Support Building (MSB) located at the Soo Locks Complex. The MSB houses warehouse, shop and administrative spaces totaling approximately 60,000 sq. ft., constructed in 1942. The potential project includes the removal and replacement of the MSB steam heating system with a radiant heating system. The new heating system design shall utilize a combination of gas fired and hot water radiant heating components and new hot water boilers. The replacement heating system shall comply with the minimum efficiency requirements outlined in ASHRAE 90.1-2013. The existing steam supply lines have asbestos insulation and will require an Asbestos Hazard Abatement Plan, including work procedures and safety precautions conforming to Federal, State, regional, and local authorities. The current interior lighting in the warehouse area is mainly suspended T12 fixtures with magnetic ballasts controlled by manual switches. The lighting upgrade design shall utilize T8 fixtures with electric ballasts and a combination of wall and ceiling mount occupancy sensors for efficient control. The lighting design shall conform to the energy standards of ASHRAE 90.1-2013. This project will decrease energy consumption via natural gas and electricity.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice for the Marine Corps Systems Command, Program Management Office for Training Systems (PM TRASYS) Training Atmospherics Set Design Enhancements/Upgrades effort. A Draft Request for Proposal (Draft RFP), including a Total Small Business Set-Aside, has been attached to this Notice. The purpose of this Notice is to seek potential Offerors and solicit information to fulfill a requirement to provide Atmospheric set dressings for Marine Corps Training Areas. These set dressing will enhance and upgrade existing and future USMC Military Operation in Urban Terrain (MOUT); Home Station Training (HST) areas and Ranges. Currently, the existing MOUT and planned HST area facilities and surrounding Range areas are void of cultural realism. Even though these areas are equipped with streets, courtyard walls, buildings, and village shanties, the atmosphere is void of detailed cultural realism such as "prop" like items (furniture, billboards, faux foodstuffs, ersatz crops, colors and mud brick facades etc.) utilized during training scenarios. Generally, MOUT and HST buildings and walls have similar facades and lack the real world exteriors, interiors, and surrounding areas representative of realistic foreign urban areas needed for vital and realistic mission rehearsals. This project is designed to simulate a future or current deployable urban environment and support the war fighting skills and improve training opportunities for Marines, tenants, and joint service units aboard USMC training areas.
<p>The Draft RFP identifies the effort(s) required for designing, installing, managing, and documenting the Atmospherics Set. This RFP delineates efforts broken down into key conceptual areas:<br />a. Set Drawings: This allows for the set drawings of a complete MOUT, HST, or Training Range or parts thereof to enhance a realistic training environment.<br />b. Delivery/Placement: This allows for delivery and placement of complete sets within the training environment to support the training requirements.<br />c. Logistics and Data: These efforts include all aspect of life cycle product support. <br />d. Contract Management: This effort also includes delivery of timely information and data in order to manage the contract. <br />The contractor shall provide multiple sets. The contractor shall adhere to the Atmospherics Performance Specification. The contractor shall provide a set designed for a standard unit of measure (UOM), which is essentially one (1) room/space. There is no requirement for lavatory facilities in the following set designs. The contractor shall provide a set that includes: <br />a. A set that incorporates indigenous items that replicate an area of operations as designated with each delivery order with emphasis on training objectives.<br />This is a general description of the effort and its locations, and is not all-inclusive. The point of contact for this acquisition is: Ms. Janet Fondriest, Contract Specialist, at janet.fondriest@usmc.mil.<br />Any questions about the draft solicitation documents are due in writing to janet.fondriest@usmc.mil by 12:00 hours local time, 23 JAN 2015. No phone calls will be accepted. Questions submitted will be used to refine the solicitation.</p>

Given the nature of this award, the leadership of this project must foster a productive working relationship with multiple stakeholders, USAID Missions, and Washington offices worldwide. The Statement of Work presents the current draft objectives and key elements of the activity. The level of funding allocated for this project is expected to range between $9 million and $12 million over a five-year implementation period.</p>
<p>This is not an invitation for bid, request for proposal or other solicitation; and in no way obligates the US Agency for International Development (USAID) to award a contract.<br /><br />Solicitation Number: M/OAA/FS SOL-OAA-14-000149<br />Agency: US Agency for International Development<br />Requiring Office: Bureau for Food Security <br />Estimated Period of Performance: Five years<br />Location: Worldwide<br />Notice Type: Small Business Sources Sought Notification/Request for Information<br />Posted Date: August 7, 2014<br />Response Due Date: August 20, 2014<br />NAICS Code: 541618</p>
<p>STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The United States Government's (USG's) Feed the Future (FTF) Initiative promotes sound legal, regulatory, and institutional environments--or enabling environments--that increase private sector investment and expand markets and trade, leading to better food security and nutrition outcomes that drive long-term gains and sustainability. A sound enabling environment is a condition for economic growth in the agricultural sector. Research that compares the Green Revolution in Asia to agricultural development in Sub-Saharan Africa finds that institutional change, which led to a transparent state, functioning markets, and farmer organizations that represent the interests of family farmers, explains much of the agricultural success seen in Asia (Biggs, 2007; Djurfeldt et al, 2005). When the transaction costs of essential business functions are reduced through improved enabling environments, conditions are created along agricultural value chains that can stimulate trade and investment and expand market opportunities for smallholders. At the same time, informal institutions (i.e. social norms and values that govern individual and collective behavior, including gender dimensions) interact with formal rules to affect agricultural value chain development. Changes to enabling environments will lead to trade-offs, shifting costs and benefits within a society, affecting different groups within a community in different ways. Sustained gains in food security and nutrition will require improved agribusiness enabling environments that both enhance legal and regulatory frameworks for doing business in the agricultural sector, but also consider how these formal rule changes shift costs and benefits within a society. An improved enabling environment for agriculture and nutrition will: 1) reduce costs of doing business in the agricultural sector along key value chains, 2) reduce the degree of uncertainty that value chain actors face about their ability to profit in the future from investment decisions made now, 3) create the conditions for sustainable reform, and 4) increase trust and predictability among actors along agricultural value chains.</p>
<p>SCOPE</p>
<p>The Project Objective for the Enabling Environment for Food Security award is to support USAID field missions and USAID Washington through targeted approaches for diagnosing and addressing enabling environment factors. The Project will effectively respond to Mission requests for technical assistance by being adaptable and able to tailor analytical methodologies and activities to specific geographic and value chain contexts. The general Project approach will consist of designing and implementing analytical activities for USAID Washington and field Missions, building USAID and host country capacity for integrating enabling environment concepts in strategic programming, and managing the knowledge generated from these activities.</p>
<p>Successful implementation of this Project will require a mix of skills and capabilities, including: analytical and evaluation skills; education and training capability; and country logistical and Project implementation capacity. Offerors will have skills to effectively and efficiently manage limited funding and have necessary flexibility, as work plans are developed in response to demand and interest from Mission clients and as the Project and country development programs evolve. The Offeror must have the ability to match the different needs and opportunities that arise in different geographic and technical areas with expertise and capacities of possible STTA consultants. Applicants should ensure that management systems are flexible and able to respond to changing needs as the Project progresses and as needs and opportunities are identified.<br /><br />The scale of activities under this Project will depend on the availability of USAID funding and the demand for assistance for diagnostic, analytical, technical, and capacity building support. Project activities will be defined and approved in Annual Work plans and become more specific as Mission's define Scopes of Work and field support buy-ins to the project.</p>
<p>The project will generate information that will strengthen legal and institutional frameworks that create the conditions to achieve Feed the Future goals. Project activities will include targeted commercial, legal and institutional analysis, implementation support, knowledge management, capacity building, and thought leadership on how to enable institutional change that contributes to inclusive agricultural growth and improved nutrition. The project will lead to increased effectiveness of projects designed to foster institutional changes that benefit actors along key agricultural value chains, in particular, men and women smallholders, support implementation of regional harmonization efforts at the country level, as well as the longer-term interest of FTF focus, priority, and aligned countries.</p>
<p>PROJECT TASKS/ACTIVITIES</p>
<p>The Enabling Environment for Food security Project will have four components. Activities are expected to benefit Missions, including USAID Washington, developing country policymakers, actors along key agricultural value chains, development practitioners from NGOs, and other donors. Activities will be relevant to country programs responding to new challenges of enhancing food security and climate change.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that a majority of activities performed under this contract will involve financial contributions from participating USAID Mission projects. The Contactor is expected to be responsive to USAID mission demands for technical assistance. The Contractor will perform the following activities listed below.</p>
<p>Component 1. Technical Analysis and Targeted Technical Assistance:<br /><br />The Contractor will analyze legal, regulatory and institutional factors and prioritize actionable recommendations and options to assist in strategic programming and project design and to achieve regional and country level objectives. Analysis will be conducted using existing diagnostic tools (e.g. Commercial, Legal, Institutional and Regulations (CLIR) methodology, political economy framework) or through the development of custom analytical frameworks as needed. For example, agribusiness enabling environment (AgBEE) benchmarking data generated through the Agricultural Regulations and Institutions (AGRI) Index pilot implemented through USAID's Enabling Agricultural Trade (EAT) project and a comparative data set generated through the Benchmarking the Business of Agriculture (BBA) project , will be ready for benchmarking and comparative analysis purposes in FY15. These datasets represent an opportunity for USAID Missions to undertake deeper analysis of specific AgBEE factors, utilizing AgBEE tools. The Contractor will also be requested to provide analytical support that will assist approximately 30% of FTF Missions with implementing scaling plans.</p>
<p>Once a USAID Mission in a FTF country has requested an interest in buying into the Enabling Environment for Food Security project, the Project will work with Missions to define the scope of the buy-in activity, estimate a budget and a timeframe for implementation. When field Missions buy in, assignments will typically include a desk study component and a 2-3 week in-country component for further data collection comprised of field work by a small team that includes key stakeholder interviews, and triangulation to confirm findings in interviews.</p>
<p>Component 2. Knowledge Management: <br /><br />Analytical findings and knowledge the Contractor generates will become valuable when it is shared and managed. The Contractor will prepare technical briefs that expand and improve USAID Mission understanding and use of activities that promote improved enabling environments for food security. The Contractor will contribute to the knowledge base on how laws, regulations, and social norms interact to create different institutional outcomes, integrating cross-cutting themes, such as gender, climate change, and nutrition. Thought leadership also includes developing improved indicators for monitoring and evaluating enabling environment projects to assist missions with measuring performance. Thought leadership and knowledge management will lead to improved understanding about how enabling environment factors affect FTF programming. The Contractor will work closely with USAID to accomplish the following:</p>
<p>a. Utilize existing on-line gateways to knowledge generated in <br />support of the USG Feed the Future Initiative.<br />b. Support USAID field mission and Washington staff with the development of materials for public presentations.<br />c. Conduct public presentations, including on-line events, such as webinars, related to <br />assessments and other activities carried out through the project.</p>
<p>Component 3. Capacity Building: <br /><br />An improved enabling environment requires that government, the private sector, and civil society have the capacity to fulfill their distinct roles in devising, implementing, and monitoring reform efforts. The Contractor will design and conduct training for USAID staff on food security enabling environment topics to enhance the ability of Regional and Bilateral Missions to follow through with recommendations generated through technical analysis and stakeholder led processes. Trainings could range from one hour to a few days and will take place in Washington or field locations. The Project will work with USAID/BFS staff to identify training needs and timing of training. An estimated two trainings a year will take place.</p>
<p>Component 4. Implementation Support: <br /><br />Experience has shown that Missions often need support to follow through on the actionable recommendations generated through analytical work. The Contractor will provide missions with on-site short -term technical assistance (STTA) as needed to achieve country and regional objectives. The duration of on-site, full-time STTA could range from two weeks to twelve months. STTA could include embedded advisors in country or regional organizations to provide support to implementation of actionable recommendations generated from Technical Analysis, further stakeholder consultations, partner requests, presentation of findings, expert review of agricultural laws, or other interventions as identified. Implementation support could also include assisting Missions with integrating cross-cutting themes, such as gender, into follow-up actions. Importantly, the Contractor could provide support to monitor and evaluate the progress and impact from enabling environment activities. It is anticipated that at least eight of the 22 FTF focus and aligned countries will require implementation support over the life of the project based on past and current demand.</p>

<DESC>NACE 185127<br /><br />A portion of the Carter Woodson home recently collapsed and other parts were in such a condition that further collapse was highly possible. Thus, the Govenment contracted for emergency bracing and shoring of the remaining structure. So as to maintain preservation of the building and to maintain a safe site the emergency bracing that was installed needs to remain in place until&nbsp;a building renovation contract can be awarded. Thus, the Government has awarded a sole source rental contract with the firm that owns the existing emergency bracing. Removal of the existing bracing and installation of new bracing by a different company would result in extreme risk of further collapse of the structure and would result in unnecessary safety risks to contractor staff, Government personnel and the general public. This award notice provides details regarding the sole source contract.

This contract for environmental response actions and associated investigation, design, and removal activities will include service and construction activities mandated by the Defense Environmental Restoration Program (DERP), Superfund, Brownfields, Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP), environmental cleanup activities under the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Program, for its Army and Air Force customers, Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and other environmental and homeland security laws and regulations requiring support activities for military installations, Corps' civil works projects, and work for other agencies.  The DERP projects will include Installation Restoration Program (IRP) activities on active Army and Air Force installations and on Formerly Used Defense Sites (FUDS). If a specific BRAC project is identified, then BRAC requirements as prescribed in DFAR 226.71 will be applicable and addressed at that time.  Other environmental laws and regulations mandating remedial actions include but are not limited to the Federal and state versions of the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), Underground Storage Tank (UST) regulations, and the Corps of Engineers' regulations for Civil Works.

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Office of Procurement Operations (OPO), Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) Acquisition Division (AD), intends to limit the number of sources solicited when extending the period of performance for Task Order HSHQDC-12-J-00054 for an additional three (3) months, on a basis of other than full and open competition for Science, Engineering, and Technical Assistance (SETA) support services.<br /><br />Task Order HSHQDC-12-J-00054 was competitively solicited and awarded under DNDO multiple-award Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) HSHQDC-11-A-00029 to Schafer Corporation (Schafer), using the ordering procedures at FAR 8.405, on March 2, 2012, with a ten (10) month base period, and two (2) options periods, each twelve (12) months in duration.&nbsp; The total award amount is $5,013,470.40.<br /><br />DNDO has a requirement, on a limited source basis, to provide continued services while in the process of re-competing these SETA support services, at an estimated cost of $501,203.00.&nbsp; The three (3) month extension is through April 2, 2015.<br /><br />This acquisition is being conducted under the authority of the Multiple-Award Schedule Program, in accordance with FAR 8.405-6, "Limiting Sources".&nbsp; In accordance with FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(C), the circumstance restricting competition for this acquisition is that this procurement is being conducted in the interest of economy and efficiency as a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order, HSHQDC-11-A-00029/HSHQDC-12-J-00054.&nbsp; The original award was competitively solicited and awarded under the DNDO multiple-award BPA for SETA support, using the ordering procedures at FAR 8.405.&nbsp; It is necessary to limit competition for the new work described in Limited-Sources Justification (LSJ) No. FY15-0068 as a logical follow-on because continued delivery of SETA support services over the period of the extension is required to ensure that DNDO projects and initiatives that are currently supported by the incumbent&nbsp; remain on schedule while the re-compete is being conducted.&nbsp; The additional three (3) months of service will provide time for the new procurement to be completed and for a transition to occur between the current order and the new order.&nbsp; FAR 52.217-8, "Option to Extend Services" was included in the order at the time of award, but the estimated value of the option was not evaluated or accounted for in the task order ceiling price.&nbsp; Further, exercise of the option must be appropriately justified under the authority of FAR 8.405-6, as documented in LSJ No. FY15-0068.
