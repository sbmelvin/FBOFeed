OFFERORS SHOULD NOT SUBMIT FORMAL PROPOSAL UNTIL THE BAA SOLICITATION IS POSTED TO THIS WEBSITE. Projected date for release of solicitation is December 2008.</p>
<p><br />The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Space Vehicles Directorate (RV) is interested in receiving proposals from offerors to provide the advanced decision support and autonomy efforts in Space Situational Awareness (SSA), Command and Control, and Defensive CounterSpace (DCS). AFRL/RV has an ongoing R&amp;D program which is investigating and developing advanced reasoning technologies to detect, track, correlate, perform mission impact assessment, and respond to space system anomalies and threats. In order to demonstrate and assess utility of the various technologies spiral prototype development has been ongoing. This solicitation seeks proposals in the area of net-centric advanced software reasoning and command and control technologies applicable to space superiority. Data sources would include but not be limited to the orbital catalog, satellite telemetry, environmental data, specialized sensors, and Intelligence information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed effort will supplement ongoing efforts within AFRL/RV. As such established system engineering practices and standards will be used to ensure end to end functionality of components from multiple sources to include SBIR initiatives from across AFRL directorates. This shall include but not be limited to implementing and evaluating prototypes within a service oriented framework that is compatible with the ESC 850/ELSG Strategic Technical Plan (STP) and supporting the creation and maintenance of program artifacts including software modules, requirements, system design documents, interface control documents, user guides, and test plans. All system artifacts shall be done using industry standard UML to expedite short term understanding and long term maintenance of the system. Applicable Research and development should also provide system level testing and analysis during the integration phase of every development spiral.</p>
<p>Prototype technologies to support the advancement of space superiority technologies and capabilities across a multitude of domains would include Co-orbital, Direct ascent, RF, laser, and environmental detection, assessment, and mitigation. Where appropriate modeling environments will be developed to simulate realistic space environment and orbital conditions. As needed special studies will be conducted in order to help the government establish requirements and specifications. These special studies may include addressing topics in the areas of space control and integrated space situational awareness such as ASAT countermeasures, special information operations payloads, upstream data fusion, special sensors, and counter techniques</p>
<p>This acquisition is anticipated to result in one award for a contract or assistance instrument using an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. The Government anticipates awarding a Cost-Plus Fixed Fee Contract for Task 1; it will be issued concurrent with the contract award and will constitute the contract's guaranteed minimum order requirement. The anticipated ordering period for individual award(s) resulting from this BAA is up to 48 months in duration with individual task order period of performance ranging from 24 - 48 months.</p>
<p>The estimated total program budget for these efforts is approximately $5.4M over 48 months. This funding profile is an estimate only and will not be a contractual obligation for funding. All funding is subject to change due to government discretion and availability. All potential offerors should be aware that due to unanticipated budget fluctuations, funding in any or all areas may change with little or no notice.<br />FY09 FY10 FY11 FY12<br />$1.5M $1.5M $11.4M $1M</p>
<p>POTENTIAL OFFERORS ARE ADVISED OF THE FOLLOWING:</p>
<p>A. The applicable NAICS code for this announcement is 541712 with a size standard of 500.</p>
<p><br />B. This acquisition is unrestricted. This BAA is issued under the provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation paragraph 6.102(d)(2) that provides for the competitive selection of research proposals.

Other FFRDCs or contractors that propose using FFRDCs not discussed herein shall provide rationale in its proposal that the research is within the purpose, mission, general scope of effort or special competency of the FFRDC and that research to be performed would not place the FFRDC in direct competition with the private sector. The Government does not intend that FFRDCs use privileged information or access to facilities to compete with the private sector. If a contractor proposes using a FFRDC as a subcontractor, other than DOD-sponsored FFRDCs in the capacities discussed in DFARS 235.017, it must provide rationale in its proposal that supports the unique capability of the FFRDC.

<DESC>NASA Ames Research Center anticipates having a requirement for further developmentof a spacecraft bus for a potential future space mission.  The bus carries the payloadinto a low Earth orbit, provides electrical power to the payload, orients and stabilizesthe boresight of an onboard telescope, collects and compresses data from the onboardscience instruments for later transmission to the ground, executes stored commands todirect science instrument activities, and communicates with the ground systems.  Thecontractor shall provide all design, development, production, assembly, test and checkoutefforts to provide the spacecraft bus for integration with other hardware and softwareelements of the vehicle.The unique requirements for the spacecraft bus and the vendor are as follows:1.  There are strict requirements for pointing (2.5 arcseconds) and slewing (execute a 60degree slew and settle of spacecraft motion in less than 150 seconds) utilizing low-costcomponents.  Vendor shall demonstrate high heritage for this pointing accuracy.2.  Mission will have a 2-year orbit life at 600 km, equatorial, 2.1 degree inclinationorbit.3.  Bus shall be less than 150 kg in mass and 266 Watts power.4.  Bus shall carry a minimum 100 kg payload and provide a minimum of 120 Watts of powerto the payload.5.  Total price for bus shall not exceed $26 million.6.  No longer than twenty (20) month development from Authority to Proceed (ATP) todelivery.7.  Bus shall have S-band communications and VHF capability. 8.  Bus shall have capability to package payload electronics of 21.1 kg inside the bus.9.  The mounting plate for the payload must remain at 5 deg C +/- 5 deg C.10.  Vendor shall follow NASAs Small Explorer (SMEX) guidelines for a modified class Dmission as described at: http://explorers.larc.nasa.gov/smexlib.html   .11.  Vendor shall have demonstrated delivery of class D hardware and software to multipleU.S. government customers with successful flight experiences.12.  Vendor shall demonstrate the ability to perform testing in the loop by ATP plus 3months. 13.  Vendor shall demonstrate expertise in designing and engineering the integration ofprecision optical payloads.14.  Vendor shall demonstrate extensive experience delivering sophisticated hardware,software and documentation to the Government over a series of projects and within thelast 3 years.  Potential offerors must demonstrate as part of their capability statementthat they understand and can comply with NASA specific procedures and processesassociated with spacecraft bus design and manufacture for a SMEX mission.15.  Vendor shall comply with the requirements of NASA FAR Supplement 1852.225-70 ExportLicenses.  The vendor is subject to U.S. export control laws and regulations, includingITAR and EAR, and is responsible for obtaining appropriate licenses and/or approvals fromthe Department of State or the Department of Commerce when applicable.16.  Vendor shall have demonstrated working as an Integrated Product Team (IPT) orpartner delivering hardware to the Government.NASA ARC intends to purchase these services from ATK Space Systems Inc. of Beltsville,MD, in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only one responsible source and no othersupplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.	For this follow-on requirementfor the continued development of the spacecraft bus, it is likely that award to any othersource would result in substantial duplication of cost to NASA that is not expected to berecovered through competition; furthermore, a competitive procurement would result inunacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirements.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified points of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. Pacifictime on November 17, 2008.  Capabilities and qualifications must be emailed toMarianne.Shelley@nasa.gov and Rachel.Khattab@nasa.gov.	Such capabilities/qualificationswill be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct thisprocurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to competethis proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to thisnotice, is solely within the discretion of the government.Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<a href="mailto:sedgley@niehs.nih.gov">SEDGLEY, DAVID C</a>
<DESC>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences is soliciting proposals, from all Small Businesses, for the National Toxicology Program (NTP) Technical Reports Preparation Support Services.  This notice is, in essence, a re-issuance of a notice for solicitation NIHES2008017, which was cancelled for as a result of a NAICS Code appeal.  The previous notice was cancelled after a NAICS Code appeal.  The previous solicitation was under NAICS Code 541712, Research and Development.  This notice and solicitation are under NAICS Code 511130, Book Publishers.  The Contractor shall serve as a resource to the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences for the preparation of Public Health Service documents describing NTP studies of the toxicology and carcinogenicity of selected chemicals.  The documents to be produced are generically known as Technical Reports, which are government-produced, peer-reviewed, book-style documents describing in full detail studies conducted and overseen by the NTP.  Two principal kinds of reports will be produced, differing primarily in length and the type of review process they undergo.  The first are book-length monographs (approximately 150 to 300 pages) that provide an overview of the literature on the biologic effects of a particular substance or set of chemicals and full details of the conduct, results, and interpretation of long-term (generally 2-year) NTP studies of the effects of the test chemical in rodents.  The subject matters in these reports include general toxicology, animal physiology, histologic and clinical pathology, chemistry, genetics, and statistics, and may also on occasion include pharmacology, molecular biology, immunotoxicity, developmental and reproductive toxicology, or other related disciplines.  Historically these reports have primarily consisted of Technical Reports on long-term carcinogenesis studies, but future reports, similar in size and complexity, may deal with other specialties such as reproductive or developmental toxicology.  The short reports also describe a variety of toxicity studies in rodents, generally shorter in duration.  Historically these reports have been NTP Toxicity Reports on short-term toxicity studies in rodents, but future reports may also deal with other specialties such as immunotoxicity.  These reports are generally shorter in length (50 to 150 pages) and involve the same subject areas as the long reports.   The Contractor shall work in concert, with NTP staff scientists and NTP contractors to provide technical writing, copy editing, proofreading, word processing, desktop publishing, graphics, file research, and record keeping services.  File research is broadly defined as reviewing laboratory reports and extracting relevant experimental information and also capturing, downloading and reformatting files of tabular data.  The Contractor shall engage in report preparation activities, at the direction of the Project Officer, for approximately 40 reports in various stages at one time.  Each report will be prepared in a series of five or four drafts, each incorporating text, materials, and revisions from NTP staff.  Each report will be presented for outside peer review at one of the intermediate draft stages; some reviews of Technical Reports are conducted in public session.  The Contractor shall provide review draft reports for each draft stage and shall also prepare desk top publishing files for use by the Government and PDF and/or HTML files for display on the NIEHS World Wide Web servers.  Approximately 24 reports shall be presented for review and printed each year; the Contractor should expect to commence preparation of approximately two reports per month and to deliver approximately two drafts per week.  The Contractor should be prepared to provide flexibility in scheduling deliverables, in consultation with the Project Officer, to accommodate Program needs, particularly to accommodate the presentation of several (as many as eight to ten) reports for review at one time. The contractor shall archive all materials received, maintain a log of all materials received and delivered, and submit a biweekly status report detailing the status of each report in preparation and the cumulative labor hours spent on each report.  All materials sent to the Contractor are considered the property of the Government, and are not be used for any other purpose.  Each report shall follow a standard format and will contain a cover page, various front matter, (e.g. Note to the Reader; Title Page; Tables of Contents, Figures, and Tables; lists of contributors; and in later drafts, lists of reviewers and summary of reviewers comments and an overall summary) separate sections for an Abstract, Introduction, Materials and Methods, Results, Discussion, References, and various Appendixes.  Page layout will include text, tables (both embedded in pages of text and multi-page data sets), line art graphics, and photomicrographs with captions.  In various drafts, text may have different spacing and columniation.  Pages will carry headers and/or footers identifying the report by name and number, draft status, and page number.  At various draft stages the page numbering may be either numerically consecutive from the front or alphanumeric for individual appendixes.  Contents and format requirements are subject to periodic revision by the Program and the Project Officer.  Examples of currently produced reports are available for view under NTP Study Reports on the NTP website http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov.  Reports are to be prepared with suitable software publishing package with the capability to incorporate the entire report, including all headings, text, tables, line art images, and photomicrographs, into a single file.  The Contractor shall be able to produce hard copies, electronic files, and Portable Document (PDF) files of the entire report, or sections thereof, for use by the NTP.   The contractor shall provide Section 508 Compliant web-optimized PDF files for those draft stages that will be placed on the NTP web site.  The Contractor shall be able to receive and capture electronic files with text, graphics, and tables from a variety of sources, platforms, and programs.  Electronic data accessing methods will include reading disks, e-mail attachments (originating both from Macintosh and PC platforms), and World Wide Web sites.  These files may be in a variety of formats and programs, including but not limited to MS Word (various versions) for text files, Excel spreadsheets, and TIFF (Tagged Image File Format), GIF, or JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) files for photographs.  The Contractor should also be able to read and capture text with citations incorporated in reference libraries (e.g., EndNote).  The Contractor shall be responsible for ensuring the accuracy of transcription of any electronically converted or hand-keyed text or data.  On occasion the Contractor may be asked to prepare graphical displays of data (e.g., time plots or bar graphs) or chemical structures and metabolism pathways.  These should be prepared as transportable files with programs such as Photoshop for line art, Freehand for graphics, and Chem Draw or ISIS/Draw for chemical structures and not be embedded in a proprietary format.  The contractor shall have the capability of scanning line art graphics (e.g., chemistry spectra, schematic diagrams) into electronic files at a resolution of 600-1200 dpi.  In the event that photographs (rather than digital files) of photomicrographs are provided, the contractor shall have the capability of scanning the photograph at the original quality and producing a TIFF file at a final resolution of 300 dpi for color images or with gray tones for black and white images.  For all graphics the contractor shall use programs that capture the required information in a file format without loss of quality of the image. During the report preparation process the Contractor shall be able to extract portions of entire sections or the report and send them as electronic files to NTP staff for review.  The Contractor will certify that a written enforced administrative process to identify, manage, reduce and eliminate conflicting financial interest is currently in effect.  The anticipated effective date of the subsequent award is January 1, 2009.  The performance period for the base contract is expected to be 60 months.  Should the Government choose to exercise the time extension options for continued support; the period may be extended to December 31, 2019.  For estimating purposes the Government anticipated an approximate level-of-effort of 12 person-years per year for the length of the contract and for each one-year extension option.  The Government anticipates the participation of a principal investigator, a production supervisor, senior science writers, technical writers/copy editor, desktop publishing specialists and clerical staff.  There is no prescribed mix of writers/editors and or desktop publishing specialist, but rather bidders should develop a strategy and team they feel is appropriate for performing the required task.  The expected release date of the RFP is July 10, 2008 with proposals due August 11, 2008 (per FAR 5.203(e)).  Interested organizations should request a copy of the RFP in writing from David C. Sedgley, Contract Specialist, P.O. Box 12874, 79 T.W. Alexander Drive, Building 4401, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709; by telephone (919) 541-4027 or by FAX request (301) 435-2709.  On the release date an online version of the RFP will be available on the internet in a PDF format attached to this synopsis.  The proposed contract is 100% set aside for small business concerns.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal. A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested.

National Institute on Drug Abuse, Office of Acquisitions- Neurosciences, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition, on behalf of the National Institute on Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to Nikolay Novikov, Ph.D. for continuation of services under current purchase order HHSN271200800514P.  The services are increased in order to complete the project under protocol Z01 NS 02139-022.  The NINDS is investigating how drugs modify dopamine receptor stimulation affect dynamic patterns in neuronal spike trains and local field potentials in basal ganglia thalamocortical circuits in conjunction with changes in cortical function. To study neurophysiological changes associated with stroke and the effects of dopaminergic agents on these changes, the NINDS needs to establish techniques to compare patterned and oscillatory activity of neurons within cortex and in the basal ganglia and interconnected brain areas such as the basal ganglia.  These studies will be integrated with imaging studies (conducted by collaborators) and will allow insight into the neurophysiological basis of changes observed with imaging techniques.    

These studies will require sophisticated knowledge of surgical techniques for rat. The rat artery and vein will be individually cannulated under isofluorane anesthesia allowing for tight control of anesthesia levels.  Glass electrodes will be made and implanted for recording of neuronal activity.   

Data, using the lab computers, will be collected from two to three electrodes implanted in different brain regions of the rat brain to monitor changes associated with stroke and dopamine receptor stimulation.  Data representing waveform and timing of the action potentials will be analyzed and displayed in graphic form in order to further process various periods for cross correlations of spike trains and local field potentials from all the different pairs of neurons recorded.  Composite computer-based analysis of local field potential and spike train wave from power spectra, dominant frequency and coherence analysis of the single unit data and local field potential data will be required.  Data collection techniques will need to be verified though parallel experiments demonstrating the appropriate type of referencing and absence of signal contamination resulting from volume conduction and grounding errors.  After studies are completed, rat brain tissue will be processed for histochemical markers.  

Dr. Novikov has been performing the services under the protocol.  There is no known other source that can perform the specific rat surgery.


The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition using FAR 13 procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government. 

Comments to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NOI798407 may be submitted to the NIDA, Station Support/Simplified Acquisition Branch, 31 Center Drive, Bldg 31, Room 1B59, Bethesda, MD 20892-2080, and Attention: Susan A. Nsangou, Contracting Officer.

Installation support shall consist of plastic fabrication and the AAG/IAAG installation on MCM ships.    This procurement is not suitable for competition for the following reasons:   C4 Group has previously installed the AAG on four MCM ships and has developed unique jigs suitable for the installation which significantly decrease installation time.  The use of another contractor would require a substantial investment in order to duplicate these jigs.  The NAICS code is 541330 and the small business size standard is $4.5 million.   The resultant contract shall be a firm-fixed price purchase order.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The four forests in Northern California (Klamath, Mendocino, Six Rivers and Shasta Trinity) commonly known as the Northern Province are seeking local sources for vehicle repair for fire equipment such as fire engines, crew carriers, water tenders and heavy equipment.  The four forests have approximately 100-125 vehicles that require routine annual maintenance and may need diagnosis and repair of vehicle deficiencies.  Some vehicles such as Fire Engines and Water Tenders require additional special servicing and repair of pumping apparatus.  Local qualified vendors are sought within the geographic location of the following California counties: Butte, Colusa, Del Norte, Glenn, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Shasta, Siskiyou, Tehama, and Trinity.  This geographic requirement is necessary for the delivery/pickup of the vehicles and close access for the Government Inspectors who will perform quality assurance.  In order to facilitate numerous purchase orders throughout this large geographic area, Northern Province Acquisitions is seeking to establish Basic Ordering Agreements with local qualified vendors to identify vendors and streamline the reoccurring need to incorporate standard requirements for repetitive, similar purchases.  Individual orders are expected to range from $3,000 to $7,000 with a maximum order limitation of $25,000.  There is no guarantee of award of any purchase order.  Enclosed is a draft Basic Ordering Agreement that outlines the terms and conditions that are applicable to purchase orders issued for this type of vehicle repair.  Vendors desiring to be considered for a Basic Ordering Agreement shall complete the attached Vendor Questionnaire and submit to the Contracting Officer for consideration of an agreement.  All vendors shall be currently registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and in the On-Line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).  Registration can be accessed through the CCR website at www.ccr.gov.  Agreements will be restricted to small businesses under NAICS code 811111 (size standard $7 million average annual receipts).

Annual Receipts — Gross receipts are averaged over a concern's latest three (3) completed fiscal years to determine its average annual receipts.  "Receipts" means the concern's gross or total income, plus cost of goods sold, as defined by or reported on the concern's Federal Income Tax return.  The term does not include, however, net capital gains or losses, or taxes collected for and remitted to a taxing authority if included in gross or total income.  The concern may not deduct income taxes, property taxes, cost of materials or funds paid to subcontractors.  Travel, real estate and advertising agents, providers of conference management services, freight forwarders, customs brokers and tour operators may deduct amounts they collect on behalf of another.  If a concern has not been in business for three (3) years, the average weekly revenue for the number of weeks the concern has been in business is multiplied by 52 to determine its average annual receipts.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) seeks information from vendors with experience in Operator Control Units (OCUs) for Unmanned Vehicles (UV).  The purpose of this RFI is to determine potential suppliers and their related products and services as may be applied to an OCU with the desirable features presented herein.  This is a Sources Sought announcement, a market survey for written information only.  This is not a solicitation and no contract will be awarded from this announcement.
Background
NSWC PCD is a recognized technical leader in unmanned systems integration & their application to littoral warfare mission areas.  NSWC PCD Code E11 manages an Office of Naval Research (ONR) product funding line for Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) development in support of Mine CounterMeasures (MCM) capabilities gaps. These MCM systems will operate in sea lanes, shallow water, and very shallow water in support of amphibious landings and to ensure safe transport for all maritime assets. These systems will utilize various UUVs to perform missions.  An optimal Operators Control Unit (OCU) is an important component of a system that will deliver mission success. 
Description 
-  Suppliers with existing OCUs and/or sufficiently developed hardware/software such that they can be demonstrable are welcome.  Provide data on capability, facilities, expertise.-  Vendors should demonstrate cooperative attitude with a focus on teaming with Navy (Government) on product development.-  RFI responses may include a detailed list of products/services. A rough order magnitude estimate is requested. -  Anticipated desirable features of the OCU: i.e., what we seek:-  Demonstrate-able features that present an optimal Operator Control Unit that satisfies requirements for operability, compatibility, and supportability.-  Joint Architecture for Unmanned Systems (JAUS) compliance is highly desirable but not a requirement.  It is required that the end product be JAUS compliant, so a path to meeting this requirement must be clearly stated.-  Novel, i.e., an "outside the box" approach is welcome-  Open architecture-  Address good Human Factors, commonly called "user friendly"-  Tailored for a continuum from manual to autonomous operations-  Easily reconfigurable such that an operator can customize the appearance, content, format and function of each displayed instrument-  Easily reconfigurable such that the operator can customize the arrangement of the instruments in to groups of display pages that are mission oriented (mission planning, real time operations, maintenance, post mission data analysis and reporting)-  Designed to minimize opportunities for:-  system failure-  operator errors-  Capability to support pre-launch review of planned portion of mission.-  Provide the operator the required feedback on system and mission status.-  Simple, clean and without unnecessary features but yet address user requirements for each mission phase (driven by a task analysis that has determined the operational requirements)-  The display pages for each mission phase should have a common look and feel-  Displays that are compatible with video and sonar real-time images.-  Also interested in an interface that automatically changes appearance/functionality, as the mission progresses and different capabilities become more important.  For example, as the vehicle power subsides the resolution of the displayed information on the battery should increase due to the criticality of that information.  Also that information should be meaningful to the operator such as run time left instead of volts or some other measure that requires translation to be meaningful to the operator.RESPONSES:  Please respond by email and limit all responses to 5 pages.  Brochures, links or additional information on the company capabilities is not included in the 5 page restriction.

<DESC>The cable shop is seeking new technology to incorporate in future processing methhods.  These upgrades encompass wiring harness reclamation procedures of shielded and non-shielded cables.  Procedures include but are not limited to: cleaning methods, testing procedures and equipment, repair work, and material presentation.<BR><BR>The cable shop seeks to benefit from innovative cleaning methods to remove dirt, grime, oil, grease, and paint from harness connectors, back shells, and protective rubber shrink wrapped coatings.  The alternative method will not weaken or damage cables. Furthermore, a cleaning method that will clean bulk amounts of harnesses and render completely free of moisture minutes after cleaning cycle if applicable.  The removal of all moisture will be necessary to enable electrical testing to be performed without condensation/moisture causing faults in testing procedures.<BR><BR>The cable shop needs new testing procedures for non-shielded cables.  Current testing is through the use of multi-meter and wiring schematic to check continuity within the harness and its connectors.  The current process consumes a lot of time and restricts productivity.<BR><BR>Harness repair operations are researching new technology to perform repairs of protective heat shrink wrap separations and cuts without the removal of connectors and back shells.  The protective wrap is of high and low temp specifications and will be used on shielded and non-shielded applications.	<BR><BR>Cable repair branch needs professional material transportation and presentation to customers.  Material transporter will incorporate visual management for inventory at a glance and be practical in size along with ease of mobility. Transporter will be used inside of support shop to load processed material then taken outside of building where a forklift will transport to customers nearby.<BR><BR>Overall the cable repair branch is going to eliminate waste and become more productive by employing new technology and methods to process material. <BR><BR>

<DESC>The Central Region (6, 7 & 8), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 42 Army, Navy, Air Force Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the states of Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming, announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Adhesive Strips.<BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.<BR><BR>The major facilities in the region include but are not limited to Brooke Army Medical Center Fort Sam Houston TX, Wilford Hall Medical Center Lackland AFB, TX, Darnall Army Medical Center, Fort Hood, TX, Reynolds ACH Fort Sill, OK, William Beaumont Army Medical Center Fort Bliss, TX, 10th Medical Group USAF Academy, CO, Evans ACH Fort Carson CO, Fort General Leonard Wood ACH, MO, Fort Riley, KS, 99th Medical Group Nellis AFB, NV, and Bayne-Jones ACH Fort Polk, LA.<BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel and facilitated by Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO).  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products.  This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.<BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two year(s) (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years.) Anticipated selection date is December 2008.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  A multiple vendor RIA selection may provide the best-value, lowest overall cost alternative if: 1) The requirements of the Region for Adhesive Strips product line can be met in the most clinically effective manner by more than one vendor, and 2) The requirements of the Region for Adhesive Strips product line can be met with the lowest overall cost, by more than one vendor.<BR><BR>B.	Products & Performance Required.<BR><BR>The Central Region is seeking product line items in the category of Adhesive Strips, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.  Within this region, this Adhesive Strips has an estimated annual dollar demand of $44,827.14.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Criteria below.<BR><BR>At the request of the Central Region MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor if deemed appropriate for the product line.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors.<BR><BR>Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their detailed responses to the technical/company criteria and (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to the enclosed POC.  Submissions must be received by 3PM CDT on the specified closing date/time of this RFRIAQ.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating in the standardization process.<BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  <BR><BR>Responses should be sent to Mr. Jim Quinn, jim.quinn.ctr@sa-msmo.tma.osd.mil address; Tri-Service Regional Business Office, 7800 IH-10 West, Suite 220, San Antonio TX 78230.  All e-mail communication between vendors and the region should be digitally signed.  Contact Mr. Jim Quinn at (210) 292-3295 prior to the closing date of this announcement with any further questions.<BR><BR>D.	Evaluation Criteria.  <BR><BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Central Region.  They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  <BR><BR>Phase I Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their detailed responses and required documentation to the POC by the required response date.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: (1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (2) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.<BR>NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.<BR><BR>The following equally weighted Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:<BR><BR>1.  Vendors must provide a complete line of Adhesive Strips products.  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. At a minimum, a complete product line includes:  Adhesive Strips, Sterile, Extra Large, Non-Stick Pad, two inches by four and one half inch; Adhesive Plastic Strips, Sterile, three-fourth inch by three inches; Adhesive Sheer Strips, Sterile, three-fourth inch by three inches; Adhesive Strips, Flexible three-fourth by three inches; Adhesive Strips one inch by three inches; Adhesive Strip Sterile, Flexible Fabric, three-fourths by three inches;  Adhesive Strips, Flexible three-fourths by three inches; Adhesive Strips, plastic three-fourth by three inches; Adhesive Strips, Sterile design with cartoon characters. Vendors are to provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ.  At the conclusion of the evaluation period, vendors will be allowed to pick-up the remainder of unused products.  If products are not picked up within ten days they will be discarded. <BR>2.  Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Adhesive Strips product line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal.  (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.)<BR>3.  Vendors must have a separate agreement with the prime vendor (currently, Central Region (6, 7 & 8) prime vendor is Cardinal Healthcare) for distribution in the Region.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified.)  Provide documentation of agreement with Prime Vendor.<BR>4.  Vendors must submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Vendors are to provide quote on discounts, when requested by the TRBO. <BR>5.  Vendors must have a local vendor representative available in the region.  Provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address.<BR><BR><BR>Phase II Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process. Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the TRBO, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets and literature from the product group to be sent to the TRBO for evaluation.  Upon request vendors are required to ship their samples directly to:<BR><BR>				Mr. James Quinn<BR>				7800 IH-10 West Suite 220<BR>				San Antonio, TX  78230-4768<BR><BR>Vendors will be allowed 14 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery.  Upon request samples and literature must be shipped to arrive at the TRBO by COB, 4PM CDT, on the (14th) calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver the literature and product sample sets by the deadline will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.  NOTE: all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the quantity, products, description of items, and date of shipment from the vendor, anticipated delivery date and individual who signed for literature and product sample sets.  Specific MTFs will evaluate the vendors product sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a non-clinical setting using a Likert scale, with a one to five (1-5) rating.  The scale descriptors are: one (1)-not acceptable, two (2)-minimally acceptable, three (3)-acceptable, four (4)-more acceptable and five (5)-highly acceptable.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for 5 calendar days.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.0 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative at or near 3.0 depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.0, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and will be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.<BR>To determine acceptability, a CPT comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below.<BR><BR>The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative: <BR><BR>1. Adhesive seals around the nonstick pad <BR>a. Seals out dirt and germs<BR>b. This criterion will be evaluated in a non-clinical setting <BR>c. Products will be observed for seal during the evaluation.<BR><BR>2. Breathable material<BR>a. Lets air in to promote healing<BR>b. This criterion will be evaluated in a non-clinical setting <BR>c. Products will be inspected during the evaluation.<BR>	<BR>3. Conforms as you move <BR>a. Bandages stay on and provide wound protection<BR>b. This criterion will be evaluated in a non-clinical setting <BR>c. Products will be observed for conformity during evaluation.<BR><BR>Phase III Pricing Analysis Process.  The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or Adhesive Stripss requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.).  <BR><BR>After the clinical/performance evaluation is completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the minimum clinical acceptability target threshold will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes (as well as product cross-reference data) based on committed volume of 80% of the total Regional requirement.  Vendors will be provided 14 calendar days to submit their price quotes in a prescribed format via email.  Price quotes must be received by 3PM CDT on the 14th calendar day.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/ participation.  <BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis: (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs).  This represents the new estimated annual cost or the total cost post standardization and includes the vendors products, and the products that could not be matched.  It reflects the amount the Region would pay the vendor using the RIA pricing.  (2) Potential Cost Avoidance.  Cost avoidance is calculated by subtracting the RIA price from the Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) price and multiplying by 12-months of usage.  This is included as a reporting Matrix.  (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines.  The unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar Adhesive Stripss for each vendor.  Those items that are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to the region for the unmatched product line and the end post-standardization costs.  (4) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.  THE CLOSING DATE IS 24 November 2008 3PM CDT.<BR><BR><BR>

In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: (1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (2) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.<BR>NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.<BR><BR>The following equally weighted Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:<BR><BR>Technical/Company Criteria:  During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT validated/approved the equally weighted company/technical criteria outlined below:  <BR>1.	Vendors must provide a complete line of IV Securement Device products.  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. At a minimum, a complete product line includes:  Peripheral IV securement device; Central Venous securement device; Radial and Femoral Arterial securement device; Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter securement device.  Vendors are to provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ.  At the conclusion of the evaluation period, vendors will be allowed to pick-up the remainder of unused products.  If products are not picked up within ten days they will be discarded.<BR>2.	Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the IV Securement Device product line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal.  (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.)<BR>3.	Vendors must have a separate agreement with the prime vendor (currently, Central Region (6, 7 & 8) prime vendor is Cardinal Healthcare) for distribution in the Region.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified.)  Provide documentation of agreement with Prime Vendor.<BR>4.	Vendors must submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Vendors are to provide quote on discounts, when requested by the TRBO. <BR>5.	Vendors must have a local vendor representative available in the region.  Provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address. <BR><BR>Phase II Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process. Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the TRBO, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets and literature from the product group to be sent to the TRBO for evaluation.  Upon request vendors are required to ship their samples directly to:<BR><BR>				Mr. James Quinn<BR>				7800 IH-10 West Suite 220<BR>				San Antonio, TX  78230-4768<BR><BR>Vendors will be allowed 14 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery.  Upon request samples and literature must be shipped to arrive at the TRBO by COB, 4PM CDT, on the (14th) calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver the literature and product sample sets by the deadline will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.  NOTE: all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the quantity, products, description of items, and date of shipment from the vendor, anticipated delivery date and individual who signed for literature and product sample sets.  Specific MTFs will evaluate the vendors product sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a non-clinical setting using a Likert scale, with a one to five (1-5) rating.  The scale descriptors are: one (1)-not acceptable, two (2)-minimally acceptable, three (3)-acceptable, four (4)-more acceptable and five (5)-highly acceptable.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for 5 calendar days.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.0 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative at or near 3.0 depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.0, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and will be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.<BR>To determine acceptability, a CPT comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below.<BR><BR>The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative: <BR><BR>1. IV Securement device instructions for application to the skin are clear. <BR>a. Save staff time enhancing efficiency. Protect patient.<BR>b. This criteria will be evaluated non-clinical setting.<BR>c. Instructions will be reviewed during a literature review.<BR><BR>2. IV Securement device instructions for removal of the device from the skin are clear. <BR>a. Save staff time enhancing efficiency. Protect patient.<BR>b. This criteria will be evaluated non-clinical setting.<BR>c. Instructions will be reviewed during a literature review.<BR><BR>3. IV Securement device holds intravenous catheter securely in place. <BR>a. Protects the integrity of the insertion site<BR>b. This criteria will be evaluated non-clinical setting<BR>c. The IVsecurement device will be evaluated on how secure it holds the IV.  <BR><BR>Phase III Pricing Analysis Process.  The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product line requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.).  <BR><BR>After the clinical/performance evaluation is completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the minimum clinical acceptability target threshold will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes (as well as product cross-reference data) based on committed volume of 80% of the total Regional requirement.  Vendors will be provided 14 calendar days to submit their price quotes in a prescribed format via email.  Price quotes must be received by 3PM CDT on the 14th calendar day.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/ participation.  <BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis: (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs).  This represents the new estimated annual cost or the total cost post standardization and includes the vendors products, and the products that could not be matched.  It reflects the amount the Region would pay the vendor using the RIA pricing.  (2) Potential Cost Avoidance.  Cost avoidance is calculated by subtracting the RIA price from the Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) price and multiplying by 12-months of usage.  This is included as a reporting Matrix.  (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines.  The unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar products for each vendor.  Those items that are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to the region for the unmatched products and the end post-standardization costs.  (4) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.  THE CLOSING DATE IS 24 November 2008 3PM CDT.<BR>

<DESC>A.	General Information.<BR><BR>The Central Region (6, 7 & 8), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 42 Army, Navy, Air Force Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the states of Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming, announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Safety Glasses.<BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.<BR><BR>The major facilities in the region include but are not limited to Brooke Army Medical Center Fort Sam Houston TX, Wilford Hall Medical Center Lackland AFB, TX, Darnall Army Medical Center, Fort Hood, TX, Reynolds ACH Fort Sill, OK, William Beaumont Army Medical Center Fort Bliss, TX, 10th Medical Group USAF Academy, CO, Evans ACH Fort Carson CO, Fort General Leonard Wood ACH, MO, Fort Riley, KS, 99th Medical Group Nellis AFB, NV, and Bayne-Jones ACH Fort Polk, LA.<BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel and facilitated by Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO).  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products.  This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.<BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two year(s) (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years.) Anticipated selection date is December 2008.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  A multiple vendor RIA selection may provide the best-value, lowest overall cost alternative if: 1) The requirements of the Region for Safety Glasses products can be met in the most clinically effective manner by more than one vendor, and 2) The requirements of the Region for Safety Glasses product line can be met with the lowest overall cost, by more than one vendor.<BR><BR>B.	Products & Performance Required.<BR><BR>The Central Region is seeking Safety Glasses items in the category of Safety Glasses, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.  Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar demand of $10,627.28.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Criteria below.<BR><BR>At the request of the Central Region MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor if deemed appropriate for the product line.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors.<BR><BR>Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their detailed responses to the technical/company criteria and (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to the enclosed POC.  Submissions must be received by 3PM CDT on the specified closing date/time of this RFRIAQ.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating in the standardization process.<BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  <BR><BR>Responses should be sent to Mrs. Sarah Allen, sarah.allen.ctr@sa-msmo.tma.osd.mil address; Tri-Service Regional Business Office, 7800 IH-10 West, Suite 220, San Antonio TX 78230.  All e-mail communication between vendors and the region should be digitally signed.

Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their detailed responses and required documentation to the POC by the required response date.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: (1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (2) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.<BR>NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.<BR><BR>The following equally weighted Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:<BR><BR>Technical/Company Criteria:  During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT validated/approved the equally weighted company/technical criteria outlined below:  <BR>1.  Vendors must provide a complete line of Stethoscope products.  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. At a minimum, a complete product line includes:  Stethoscope: 27 inch double lumen with turnable diaphragm chest piece for adults and children; Stethoscope: single lumen double sided chest piece 28 inch  tube turnable diaphragm; Stethoscope: single head binaural, 22 inch; Accessory pouch: includes three interchangeable bells, adult diaphragm pediatric diaphragm and two pairs of eartips.  Vendors are to provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ.  At the conclusion of the evaluation period, vendors will be allowed to pick-up the remainder of unused products.  If products are not picked up within ten days they will be discarded.<BR>2.  Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Product Line product line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal.  (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.)<BR>3.  Vendors must have a separate agreement with the prime vendor (currently, Central Region (6, 7 & 8) prime vendor is Cardinal Healthcare) for distribution in the Region.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified.)  Provide documentation of agreement with Prime Vendor.<BR>4.  Vendors must submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Vendors are to provide quote on discounts, when requested by the TRBO. <BR>5.  Vendors must have a local vendor representative available in the region.  Provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address. <BR><BR>Phase II Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process. Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the TRBO, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets and literature from the product group to be sent to the TRBO for evaluation.  Upon request vendors are required to ship their samples directly to:<BR><BR>				Mrs. Sarah Allen<BR>				7800 IH-10 West Suite 220<BR>				San Antonio, TX  78230-4768<BR><BR>Vendors will be allowed 14 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery.  Upon request samples and literature must be shipped to arrive at the TRBO by COB, 4PM CDT, on the (14th) calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver the literature and product sample sets by the deadline will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.  NOTE: all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the quantity, products, description of items, and date of shipment from the vendor, anticipated delivery date and individual who signed for literature and product sample sets.  Specific MTFs will evaluate the vendors product sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a non-clinical setting using a Likert scale, with a one to five (1-5) rating.  The scale descriptors are: one (1)-not acceptable, two (2)-minimally acceptable, three (3)-acceptable, four (4)-more acceptable and five (5)-highly acceptable.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for 5 calendar days.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.0 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative at or near 3.0 depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.0, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and will be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.<BR>To determine acceptability, a CPT comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below.<BR><BR>The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative: <BR><BR>1. Adjustable binaural anatomically correct headset<BR>a. Saves time and avoid delay in providing patient care<BR>b. This criterion will be evaluated in a non-clinical setting <BR>c. Products will be observed for fit during the evaluation.<BR><BR>2. One-piece tubing design <BR>a. Easy to clean between patients<BR>b. This criterion will be evaluated in a non-clinical setting <BR>c. Products will be observed for one pierce design during the evaluation.<BR><BR>3. Acoustically sealing eartips<BR>a. To allow clinicians to quickly evaluate patients with enhanced hearing<BR>b. This criterion will be evaluated in a non-clinical setting <BR>c. Products will be observed for acoustic sealing eartips during evaluation<BR><BR><BR>Phase III Pricing Analysis Process.  The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or Stethoscopes requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.).  <BR><BR>After the clinical/performance evaluation is completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the minimum clinical acceptability target threshold will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes (as well as product cross-reference data) based on committed volume of 80% of the total Regional requirement.  Vendors will be provided 14 calendar days to submit their price quotes in a prescribed format via email.  Price quotes must be received by 3PM CDT on the 14th calendar day.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/ participation.  <BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis: (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs).  This represents the new estimated annual cost or the total cost post standardization and includes the vendors products, and the products that could not be matched.  It reflects the amount the Region would pay the vendor using the RIA pricing.  (2) Potential Cost Avoidance.  Cost avoidance is calculated by subtracting the RIA price from the Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) price and multiplying by 12-months of usage.  This is included as a reporting Matrix.  (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines.  The unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar Stethoscopes for each vendor.  Those items that are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to the region for the unmatched Stethoscopes and the end post-standardization costs.  (4) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.  THE CLOSING DATE IS 24 November 2008 3PM CDT.<BR>

<DESC><BR><BR>A.	General Information.<BR><BR>The Central Region (6, 7 & 8), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 42 Army, Navy, Air Force Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the states of Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming, announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Thermal Therapy.<BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.<BR><BR>The major facilities in the region include but are not limited to Brooke Army Medical Center Fort Sam Houston TX, Wilford Hall Medical Center Lackland AFB, TX, Darnall Army Medical Center, Fort Hood, TX, Reynolds ACH Fort Sill, OK, William Beaumont Army Medical Center Fort Bliss, TX, 10th Medical Group USAF Academy, CO, Evans ACH Fort Carson CO, Fort General Leonard Wood ACH, MO, Fort Riley, KS, 99th Medical Group Nellis AFB, NV, and Bayne-Jones ACH Fort Polk, LA.<BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel and facilitated by Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO).  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products.  This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.<BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two year(s) (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years.) Anticipated selection date is December 2008.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  A multiple vendor RIA selection may provide the best-value, lowest overall cost alternative if: 1) The requirements of the Region for Thermal Therapy can be met in the most clinically effective manner by more than one vendor, and 2) The requirements of the Region for Thermal Therapy can be met with the lowest overall cost, by more than one vendor.<BR><BR>B.	Products & Performance Required.<BR><BR>The Central Region is seeking Thermal Therapy items in the category of Thermal Therapy, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.  Within this region, this Thermal Therapy has an estimated annual dollar demand of $57,666.44.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Criteria below.<BR><BR>At the request of the Central Region MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor if deemed appropriate for the Thermal Therapy .<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors.<BR><BR>Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their detailed responses to the technical/company criteria and (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to the enclosed POC.  Submissions must be received by 3PM CDT on the specified closing date/time of this RFRIAQ.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating in the standardization process.<BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  <BR><BR>Responses should be sent to Mr. Jim Quinn, jim.quinn.ctr@sa-msmo.tma.osd.mil address; Tri-Service Regional Business Office, 7800 IH-10 West, Suite 220, San Antonio TX 78230.  All e-mail communication between vendors and the region should be digitally signed.  Contact Mr. Jim Quinn at (210) 292-3295 prior to the closing date of this announcement with any further questions.<BR><BR>D.

Thermal Therapy activates easily and begin warming/cooling within 30 seconds after activation. (Efficiency of patient care)<BR>a. Clinicians require ease of activation and quick warming/cooling to begin therapy as soon as possible to patient. <BR>b. This criterion will be evaluated by one (1) trial each using both Hot and Cold Packs in small and large sizes in a non-clinical setting.<BR>c. The evaluator follows package directions for activation and observes for ease of activation and feels Packs for onset of warming/cooling effect within 30 seconds as timed on evaluators watch. <BR>2. Thermal Therapy provide consistent temperature treatment over all surfaces of the Pack. (Efficiency of patient care). <BR>a. Clinicians require consistency of temperature effect for efficient therapeutic<BR>effect. <BR>b. This criterion will be evaluated by one (1) trial each using both Hot and Cold<BR>Packs in small and large sizes in a non-clinical setting.<BR>c. After complete activation of the Packs the evaluator feels all surfaces of Packs and assesses for hot/cold spots and areas of inconsistent temperature effect. <BR>3. Thermal Therapy do not leak under pressure. (Efficiency of patient care and patient/staff safety)<BR>a. Clinicians require leak-proof Packs for effective treatment and to minimize patient injury. <BR>b. This criterion will be evaluated by one (1) trial each using both Hot and Cold<BR>Packs in small and large sizes in a non-clinical setting.<BR>c. After complete activation of the Thermal Therapy the evaluator applies moderate pressure to Packs between palms of hands and observes for leakage of contents. <BR>4. Instructions for Use/Safety Precautions on Hot/Cold Packs packaging remain intact/legible during use. <BR>a. Clinicians require instructions for Use/Safety Precautions to be legible at all times<BR>during product use. (Efficiency of patient care and risk management)<BR>b. This criterion will be evaluated by one (1) trial each using both Hot and Cold<BR>Packs in small and large sizes in a non-clinical setting.<BR>c. After complete activation of the Packs the evaluator attempts to smear package<BR>instructions using dry fingers and using wet fingers and observes for legibility of<BR>instructions. <BR>5. Thermal Therapy remain warming/cooling effect for a minimum of 30 minutes. (Efficiency of patient care)<BR>a. Clinicians require warming/cooling effect for 30 minutes or more for efficient patient care. <BR>b. The criterion will be evaluated by one (1) trial each using both Hot and Cold<BR>Packs in small and large sizes in a non-clinical setting.<BR>c. After complete activation of the Packs the evaluator will assess for continued<BR>warming/cooling effect after 30 minutes as timed by the evaluators watch<BR><BR>Phase III Pricing Analysis Process.  The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or Thermal Therapy requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.).  <BR><BR>After the clinical/performance evaluation is completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the minimum clinical acceptability target threshold will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes (as well as product cross-reference data) based on committed volume of 80% of the total Regional requirement.  Vendors will be provided 14 calendar days to submit their price quotes in a prescribed format via email.  Price quotes must be received by 3PM CDT on the 14th calendar day.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/ participation.  <BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis: (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs).  This represents the new estimated annual cost or the total cost post standardization and includes the vendors products, and the products that could not be matched.  It reflects the amount the Region would pay the vendor using the RIA pricing.  (2) Potential Cost Avoidance.  Cost avoidance is calculated by subtracting the RIA price from the Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) price and multiplying by 12-months of usage.  This is included as a reporting Matrix.  (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines.  The unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar Thermal Therapy for each vendor.  Those items that are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to the region for the unmatched Thermal Therapy and the end post-standardization costs.  (4) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.  THE CLOSING DATE IS 24 November 2008 3PM CDT.<BR><BR>

A multiple vendor RIA selection may provide the best-value, lowest overall cost alternative if: 1) The requirements of the Region for BP Cuffs product line can be met in the most clinically effective manner by more than one vendor, and 2) The requirements of the Region for BP Cuffs product line can be met with the lowest overall cost, by more than one vendor.<BR><BR>B.	Products & Performance Required.<BR><BR>The Central Region is seeking BP Cuff items in the category of BP Cuffs, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.  Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar demand of $182,598.59.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Criteria below.<BR><BR>At the request of the Central Region MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor if deemed appropriate for the product line.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors.<BR><BR>Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their detailed responses to the technical/company criteria and (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to the enclosed POC.  Submissions must be received by 3PM CDT on the specified closing date/time of this RFRIAQ.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating in the standardization process.<BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  <BR><BR>Responses should be sent to Mrs. Sarah Allen, sarah.allen.ctr@sa-msmo.tma.osd.mil address; Tri-Service Regional Business Office, 7800 IH-10 West, Suite 220, San Antonio TX 78230.  All e-mail communication between vendors and the region should be digitally signed.  Contact Mrs. Sarah Allen at (210) 292-3287 prior to the closing date of this announcement with any further questions.<BR><BR>D.	Evaluation Criteria.  <BR><BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Central Region.  They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  <BR><BR>Phase I Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their detailed responses and required documentation to the POC by the required response date.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: (1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (2) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.<BR>NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.<BR><BR>The following equally weighted Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:<BR><BR>1.  Vendors must provide a complete line of Product Line products.  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. At a minimum, a complete product line includes: Sphygmomanometer, adult size cuff; Sphygmomanometer, adult, hand held aneroid; Sphygmomanometers, (aneroid) one piece cuff with case; Wall mount aneroid one piece adult cuff; Mobile unit model sphygmomanometer mounted on rolling stand which swivels 360 degrees and features an adjustable height stand with locking capability; Sphygmomanometer with trigger release air valve designed to use with ease using either right or left hand.  Also allows for fingertip control of cuff deflation, which helps ensure accurate blood pressure measure; Sphygmomanometer which is lightweight, pocket size and shock resistant.  Vendors are to provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ.  At the conclusion of the evaluation period, vendors will be allowed to pick-up the remainder of unused products.  If products are not picked up within ten days they will be discarded.<BR>2.  Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Adhesive Strips product line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal.  (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.)<BR>3.   Vendors must have a separate agreement with the prime vendor (currently, Central Region (6, 7 & 8) prime vendor is Cardinal Healthcare) for distribution in the Region.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified.)  Provide documentation of agreement with Prime Vendor.<BR>4.  Vendors must submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Vendors are to provide quote on discounts, when requested by the TRBO. <BR>5.  Vendors must have a local vendor representative available in the region.  Provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address. <BR><BR><BR>Phase II Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process. Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the TRBO, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets and literature from the product group to be sent to the TRBO for evaluation.  Upon request vendors are required to ship their samples directly to:  <BR><BR>				Mrs. Sarah Allen<BR>				7800 IH-10 West Suite 220<BR>				San Antonio, TX  78230-4768<BR><BR>Vendors will be allowed 14 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery.  Upon request samples and literature must be shipped to arrive at the TRBO by COB, 4PM CDT, on the (14th) calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver the literature and product sample sets by the deadline will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.  NOTE: all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the quantity, products, description of items, and date of shipment from the vendor, anticipated delivery date and individual who signed for literature and product sample sets.  Specific MTFs will evaluate the vendors product sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a non-clinical setting using a Likert scale, with a one to five (1-5) rating.  The scale descriptors are: one (1)-not acceptable, two (2)-minimally acceptable, three (3)-acceptable, four (4)-more acceptable and five (5)-highly acceptable.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for 5 calendar days.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.0 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative at or near 3.0 depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.0, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and will be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.<BR>To determine acceptability, a CPT comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below.<BR><BR>The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative: <BR><BR>1. Aneroid manometer is easy to read.<BR>a. This feature facilitates accurate readings.<BR>b. This criterion will be evaluated in a non-clinical setting.<BR>c. Products will be observed during the evaluation.<BR><BR>2. Hook and loop closure for cuff.<BR>a. Maintain secure fit to provide accurate readings to the clinicians.<BR>b. This criterion will be evaluated in a non-clinical setting.<BR>c. Products will be observed during the evaluation.<BR><BR>3. Non-abrasive skin contact surface.<BR>a. Decrease chance of injury to the patient and maintain integrity of the skin.<BR>b. This criterion will be evaluated in a non-clinical setting.<BR>c. Products will be observed during the evaluation.<BR><BR>4. Control of deflation easy.<BR>a. The clinicians will inspect the adequacy/ease of deflation during use.<BR>b. This criterion will be evaluated in a non-clinical setting.<BR>c. Products will be observed during the evaluation.<BR><BR><BR>Phase III Pricing Analysis Process.  The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or BP Cuffs requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.).  <BR><BR>After the clinical/performance evaluation is completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the minimum clinical acceptability target threshold will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes (as well as product cross-reference data) based on committed volume of 80% of the total Regional requirement.  Vendors will be provided 14 calendar days to submit their price quotes in a prescribed format via email.  Price quotes must be received by 3PM CDT on the 14th calendar day.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/ participation.  <BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis: (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs).  This represents the new estimated annual cost or the total cost post standardization and includes the vendors products, and the products that could not be matched.  It reflects the amount the Region would pay the vendor using the RIA pricing.  (2) Potential Cost Avoidance.  Cost avoidance is calculated by subtracting the RIA price from the Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) price and multiplying by 12-months of usage.  This is included as a reporting Matrix.  (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines.  The unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar BP Cuffs for each vendor.  Those items that are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to the region for the unmatched BP Cuff and the end post-standardization costs.  (4) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.  THE CLOSING DATE IS 24 November 2008 3PM CDT<BR>

This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.<BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two year(s) (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years.) Anticipated selection date is December 2008.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  A multiple vendor RIA selection may provide the best-value, lowest overall cost alternative if: 1) The requirements of the Region for Razors 	can be met in the most clinically effective manner by more than one vendor, and 2) The requirements of the Region for Razors can be met with the lowest overall cost, by more than one vendor.<BR><BR>B.	Products & Performance Required.<BR><BR>The Central Region is seeking product items in the category of Razors, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.  Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar demand of $12,465.03.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Criteria below.		<BR><BR>At the request of the Central Region MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor if deemed appropriate for the Razors .<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors.<BR><BR>Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their detailed responses to the technical/company criteria and (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to the enclosed POC.  Submissions must be received by 3PM CDT on the specified closing date/time of this RFRIAQ.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating in the standardization process.<BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  <BR><BR>Responses should be sent to Mrs. Sarah Allen, sarah.allen.ctr@sa-msmo.tma.osd.mil address; Tri-Service Regional Business Office, 7800 IH-10 West, Suite 220, San Antonio TX 78230.  All e-mail communication between vendors and the region should be digitally signed.  Contact Mrs. Sarah Allen at (210) 292-3287 prior to the closing date of this announcement with any further questions.<BR><BR>D.	Evaluation Criteria.  <BR><BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Central Region.  They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  <BR><BR>Phase I Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their detailed responses and required documentation to the POC by the required response date.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: (1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (2) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.<BR>NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.<BR><BR>The following equally weighted Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:<BR><BR>Technical/Company Criteria:  During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT validated/approved the equally weighted company/technical criteria outlined below:  <BR>1.  Vendors must provide a complete line of Razors products.  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. At a minimum, a complete product line includes:  Disposable twin bladed platinum chrome razor; Disposable single--edge prep razor; Disposable razor with comb (sterile and non-sterile)--Sterile razors are packed in a convenient peel-open pouch; Disposable single edge dry shave razor.  Vendors are to provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ.  At the conclusion of the evaluation period, vendors will be allowed to pick-up the remainder of unused products.  If products are not picked up within ten days they will be discarded. <BR>2.  Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Razor product line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal.  (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.)<BR>3.  Vendors must have a separate agreement with the prime vendor (currently, Central Region (6, 7 & 8) prime vendor is Cardinal Healthcare) for distribution in the Region.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified.)  Provide documentation of agreement with Prime Vendor.<BR>4.  Vendors must submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Vendors are to provide quote on discounts, when requested by the TRBO. <BR>5.  Vendors must have a local vendor representative available in the region.  Provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address. <BR><BR>Phase II Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process. Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the TRBO, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets and literature from the product group to be sent to the TRBO for evaluation.  Upon request vendors are required to ship their samples directly to:<BR><BR>				Mrs. Sarah Allen<BR>				7800 IH-10 West Suite 220<BR>				San Antonio, TX  78230-4768<BR><BR>Vendors will be allowed 14 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery.  Upon request samples and literature must be shipped to arrive at the TRBO by COB, 4PM CDT, on the (14th) calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver the literature and product sample sets by the deadline will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.  NOTE: all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the quantity, products, description of items, and date of shipment from the vendor, anticipated delivery date and individual who signed for literature and product sample sets.  Specific MTFs will evaluate the vendors product sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a non-clinical setting using a Likert scale, with a one to five (1-5) rating.  The scale descriptors are: one (1)-not acceptable, two (2)-minimally acceptable, three (3)-acceptable, four (4)-more acceptable and five (5)-highly acceptable.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for 5 calendar days.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.0 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative at or near 3.0 depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.0, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and will be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.<BR>To determine acceptability, a CPT comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below.<BR><BR>The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative: <BR><BR>1. Handle provides a tactile grip <BR>a. Saves time and avoid delay in providing patient care<BR>b. This criterion will be evaluated in a non-clinical setting <BR>c. Products will be observed for slip resistance during the evaluation.<BR><BR>2. Designed to prevent clogging<BR>a. Avoid use of additional razors and avoid delay in procedure<BR>b. This criterion will be evaluated in a non-clinical setting <BR>c. Products will be observed for clogging during the evaluation.<BR><BR>3. Designed to remove body hair with minimum damage to dermis<BR>a. To avoid damaging dermis, pain and discomfort<BR>b. This criterion will be evaluated in a non-clinical setting <BR>c. Products will be observed for sheathing or teeth to protect dermis during the evaluation.<BR><BR>Phase III Pricing Analysis Process.  The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product line requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.).  <BR><BR>After the clinical/performance evaluation is completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the minimum clinical acceptability target threshold will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes (as well as product cross-reference data) based on committed volume of 80% of the total Regional requirement.  Vendors will be provided 14 calendar days to submit their price quotes in a prescribed format via email.  Price quotes must be received by 3PM CDT on the 14th calendar day.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/ participation.  <BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis: (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs).  This represents the new estimated annual cost or the total cost post standardization and includes the vendors products, and the products that could not be matched.  It reflects the amount the Region would pay the vendor using the RIA pricing.  (2) Potential Cost Avoidance.  Cost avoidance is calculated by subtracting the RIA price from the Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) price and multiplying by 12-months of usage.  This is included as a reporting Matrix.  (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines.  The unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar products for each vendor.  Those items that are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to the region for the unmatched Razors and the end post-standardization costs.  (4) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.  THE CLOSING DATE IS 24 November 2008 3PM CDT.<BR>

It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.<BR><BR>The major facilities in the region include but are not limited to Brooke Army Medical Center Fort Sam Houston TX, Wilford Hall Medical Center Lackland AFB, TX, Darnall Army Medical Center, Fort Hood, TX, Reynolds ACH Fort Sill, OK, William Beaumont Army Medical Center Fort Bliss, TX, 10th Medical Group USAF Academy, CO, Evans ACH Fort Carson CO, Fort General Leonard Wood ACH, MO, Fort Riley, KS, 99th Medical Group Nellis AFB, NV, and Bayne-Jones ACH Fort Polk, LA.<BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel and facilitated by Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO).  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products.  This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.<BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two year(s) (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years.) Anticipated selection date is December 2008.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  A multiple vendor RIA selection may provide the best-value, lowest overall cost alternative if: 1) The requirements of the Region for Surface Disinfectant Decontaminant can be met in the most clinically effective manner by more than one vendor, and 2) The requirements of the Region for Surface Disinfectant Decontaminant can be met with the lowest overall cost, by more than one vendor.<BR><BR>B.	Products & Performance Required.<BR><BR>The Central Region is seeking product line items in the category of Surface Disinfectant Decontaminant, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.  Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar demand of $153,263.06.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Criteria below.<BR><BR>At the request of the Central Region MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor if deemed appropriate for the product line .<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors.<BR><BR>Vendors interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their detailed responses to the technical/company criteria and (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to the enclosed POC.  Submissions must be received by 3PM CDT on the specified closing date/time of this RFRIAQ.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating in the standardization process.<BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  <BR><BR>Responses should be sent to Mrs. Sarah Allen, sarah.allen.ctr@sa-msmo.tma.osd.mil address; Tri-Service Regional Business Office, 7800 IH-10 West, Suite 220, San Antonio TX 78230.  All e-mail communication between vendors and the region should be digitally signed.  Contact Mrs. Sarah Allen at (210) 292-3287 prior to the closing date of this announcement with any further questions.<BR><BR>D.	Evaluation Criteria.  <BR><BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Central Region.  They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  <BR><BR>Phase I Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their detailed responses and required documentation to the POC by the required response date.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: (1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (2) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.<BR>NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.<BR><BR>The following equally weighted Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:  <BR><BR>1.  Vendors must provide a complete line of Surface Disinfectant Decontaminant products.  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. At a minimum, a complete product line includes:  Surface Disinfectant/Decontaminant 24 ounce spray container; Surface Disinfectant/Decontaminant Wipes in tub containers; Surface Disinfectant/Decontaminant one gallon container; Surface Disinfectant/Decontaminant 8 ounce containers; Surface Disinfectant/Decontaminant Wipes in tub containers; Extra Large Surface Disinfectant/Decontaminant Wipes in canisters.  Vendors are to provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFQ.   At the conclusion of the evaluation period, vendors will be allowed to pick-up the remainder of unused products.  If products are not picked up within ten days they will be discarded.<BR>2.  Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Adhesive Strips product line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal.  (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.)<BR>3.  Vendors must have a separate agreement with the prime vendor (currently, Central Region (6, 7 & 8) prime vendor is Cardinal Healthcare) for distribution in the Region.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified.)  Provide documentation of agreement with Prime Vendor.<BR>4.  Vendors must submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Vendors are to provide quote on discounts, when requested by the TRBO. <BR>5.  Vendors must have a local vendor representative available in the region.  Provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address.<BR><BR>Phase II Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process. Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the TRBO, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets and literature from the product group to be sent to the TRBO for evaluation.  Upon request vendors are required to ship their samples directly to:<BR><BR>				Mrs. Sarah Allen<BR>				7800 IH-10 West Suite 220<BR>				San Antonio, TX  78230-4768<BR><BR>Vendors will be allowed 14 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery.  Upon request samples and literature must be shipped to arrive at the TRBO by COB, 4PM CDT, on the (14th) calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver the literature and product sample sets by the deadline will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.  NOTE: all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the quantity, products, description of items, and date of shipment from the vendor, anticipated delivery date and individual who signed for literature and product sample sets.  Specific MTFs will evaluate the vendors product sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a non-clinical setting using a Likert scale, with a one to five (1-5) rating.  The scale descriptors are: one (1)-not acceptable, two (2)-minimally acceptable, three (3)-acceptable, four (4)-more acceptable and five (5)-highly acceptable.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for 5 calendar days.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.0 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative at or near 3.0 depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.0, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and will be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.<BR>To determine acceptability, a CPT comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below.<BR><BR>The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative: <BR><BR>1. Contents of each packet are easily identified. <BR>a. Allows staff to quickly select products. Save time.<BR>b. This criterion will be evaluated in a non-clinical setting <BR>c. Products will be observed during the evaluation<BR>2. Wipes can be opened easily. <BR>a. Saves time for staff.<BR>b. This criterion will be evaluated in a non-clinical setting <BR>c. Products will be observed during the evaluation<BR>3. Product expiration date is easily identified. <BR>a. Allows staff to view expiration date quickly.<BR>b. This criterion will be evaluated in a non-clinical setting <BR>c. Products will be observed during the evaluation<BR>4. Disposable wipes are strong enough to prevent tearing during use. <BR>a. Tearing or shredding wipe may cause incomplete contact and affect kill times.<BR>b. This criterion will be evaluated in a non-clinical setting <BR>c. Products will be observed during the evaluation<BR>		<BR>Phase III Pricing Analysis Process.  The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or Surface Disinfectant Decontaminants requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.).  <BR><BR>After the clinical/performance evaluation is completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the minimum clinical acceptability target threshold will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes (as well as product cross-reference data) based on committed volume of 80% of the total Regional requirement.  Vendors will be provided 14 calendar days to submit their price quotes in a prescribed format via email.  Price quotes must be received by 3PM CDT on the 14th calendar day.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/ participation.  <BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis: (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs).  This represents the new estimated annual cost or the total cost post standardization and includes the vendors products, and the products that could not be matched.  It reflects the amount the Region would pay the vendor using the RIA pricing.  (2) Potential Cost Avoidance.  Cost avoidance is calculated by subtracting the RIA price from the Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) price and multiplying by 12-months of usage.  This is included as a reporting Matrix.  (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines.  The unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar Surface Disinfectant Decontaminants for each vendor.  Those items that are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to the region for the unmatched Surface Disinfectant Decontaminants and the end post-standardization costs.  (4) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.  THE CLOSING DATE IS 24 November 2008 3PM CDT.<BR>

<DESC><p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c)(1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1(a)(1), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.
<p>Marine Central Command (MARCENT), 7115 S. Boundary Blvd, MacDill AFB, FL 33621, requires the Rigel Geographic Profiling Software. The 6th Contracting Squadron intends to make an award to Environmental Criminology Research Institute (ECRI), 1807 Maritime Mews, Granville Island, Vancouver, BC. ECRI is the sole proprietor of this product. Interested parties may e-mail Joyce Wright at joyce.wright@macdill.af.mil or fax 813-828-5111, no later than Monday, 10 November 2008, 10:00 a.m. EST.</p>
<p>Per FAR Part 5.207-13(i) Fed Biz Ops Numbered Note 22 applies and is modified to read:</p>
<p>22. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received by Monday, 10 Novemeber 2008, 10:00 a.m. EST will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE(APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY)</p>
<p>This software is required to enable the Marine Central Command (MARCENT) Element to have a geographic profiling capability within the command to enable support to forward operating forces in conducting operations to search out and eliminate from the battlefield individual, high-level insurgents and terrorists in both Iraq and Afghanistan. Currently, the MARCENT G-2 does not have the capability to provide this support and there are no capabilities like this within the entire Marine Corps. MARCENT G-2 has on its staff three of the six total certified Geographic Profilers within the entire Marine Corps.</p>
<p>Environmental Criminology Research Institute's (ECRI) Rigel Geographic Profiling software utilizes a patented Criminal Geographic Targeting algorithm to provide calculations and predictive analysis regarding the most likely location of origin (anchor point) of terrorist group command and control nodes. It is the only software available that incorporates this algorithm. ECRI's Rigel has been used extensively in law enforcement; its use in a military counterinsurgency role was validated during a two-month operational test in Afghanistan. There are no other commercially available software packages with this capability.</p>

<DESC>Notice of Intebt to award sole source procurement to Giltner Trucking, LLC / 45S, 200E / Jerome / Idaho (ID) / 83338.  Giltner Trucking is located within 35 miles of the Hagerman National Fish Hatchery (Hatchery).  They have over 50 years of experience of hauling stainless tanker units (milk trucks) that are similar to the Service-owned stainless steel fish hauling tanker.

<CONTACT>Alexander Kramer, Phone 301-402-6835, Fax 301-480-0689, Email kramera@niaid.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) intends to extend the current contract N01-AO-40063 with the Henry M. Jackson Foundation (HJF) for the Support of Clinical Research Infrastructure in South Africa for up to 75 days.  Since 2004, NIAID investigators have collaborated with investigators from the South African National Defense Force (SANDF) to establish and maintain the necessary administrative and technical infrastructure needed to support the clinical research agendas in the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases and disorders of the immune system, specifically Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection and tuberculosis in South Africa. The goal of these collaborative clinical research efforts, known as project PHIDISA, has been to conduct a program of clinical research that is of critical importance to the NIH and in the process, to establish, in a host country, sustainable clinical research infrastructure.

The current contract has been utilized to help establish the needed clinical infrastructure in South Africa.  Two protocols are currently being supported by project PHIDISA at multiple sites around the country.  At this time, HJF is the only responsible source for this requirement. HJF has an established relationship with the SANDF as well as an understanding of its policies regarding the logistical support needed for the project.  HJF has established agreements in place to furnish the equipment and supplies needed to continue supporting the clinical research infrastructure in place.  HJF has developed a collaborative relationship with the South African Military Health Service as well as other U.S. collaborators working on PHIDISA.  The time and resources needed for another firm to develop these types of relationships and resources would be prohibitive at this stage of the program.  It would be detrimental to the project and potentially harmful to the lives of patients enrolled in the ongoing PHIDISA studies to switch contractors at this point.  For these reasons, NIAID believes that no offeror can fulfill the existing need for the support of the clinical research infrastructure at the present time.  Please refer any questions in writing to Alexander Kramer at kramera@niaid.nih.gov on or before November 18, 2008 at 2:00pm EST.

<SUBJECT>Environmental Legislative and Regulatory Monitoring Services - Contract Period is for 3 month duration only
<SOLNBR>N6258309P0007
<CONTACT>
<DESC>The Specialty Center Acquisitions NAVFAC, Code RAQN0 intends to award a sole source Firm Fixed Price Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) contract to Stateside Inc. for environmental legislative and regulatory monitoring services.  The awarded action is only for a period of 90 days.  The services are being procured on behalf of Naval Facilities Engineering Services Center (NAVFAC ESC), Port Hueneme, California, 93043. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 561499, Engineering Services.  The services that will be procured are available only from Stateside Inc.  The DOD has a need to monitor developing state level legislation and regulations, identify laws and rules that could impact DOD operations and, where appropriate, to articulate DOD needs and concerns to legislative and regulatory bodies.  Jurisdictions of interest include the fifty (50) states and the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands and in! trastate environmental regulatory or rulemaking organizations such as local or regional air pollution control districts, and water quality management districts in states where these exist and have autonomous rulemaking authority.  This procurement is being processed in accordance with FAR Subpart 6.302-1-Other Than Full and Open Competition.  The information is required in formats that include a Microsoft Access database, with a specific data structure.  That contractor provided database serves as a "back end" for Navy, Air Force, and Army "front end" databases reliant on the back end structure.   The front end databases serve as part of DOD Regional Environmental Coordinators' business process for managing the legislative and regulatory information, and tracking actions and follow-up.  The requirement outlined in this PWS is complimentary to previous tasks completed under a prior contract, N47408-03-D-8411.  Any other Contractor wishing to perform this requirement would ha! ve to develop both the Access database, and an internal data handling system to populate the database, and it would have to populate the database with information about all the ongoing regulatory and legislative proposals currently active in the fifty states and territories that apply to the DOD.  The development of such a database and the time required to retrieve the required information to fill the database would not only be extremely time-consuming (estimate is one month minimum), but it would be prohibitively expensive because the services ordered through this GAP coverage contract are for such a brief period of time.  The Contractor selected for award of this contract will only be providing 3 months worth of services for the DOD.  Three months of service-generated revenue would not be enough for a Contractor to recoup the associated costs of the database development and required information retrieval.  As such, it would not be profitable for Contractors that do not currently have this database structure and the required information alrea! dy in place to perform the work.  The engineering services being procured will reach back to the environmental issues being tracked for the DOD under the previous contract.  All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  Inquiries regarding this posting should be directed to Aaron Glazier (805) 982-2392.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the federal business Opportunities (FBO) website located at http://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) website located at https://www.neco.navy.mil/, and the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Acquisition website located at http://www.crane.navy.mil/acquisition/homepage.htm. FBO is the primary point of entry to be used when access to synopses and solicitations from the World Wide Web is required. However, the NECO webpage as well as the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Acquisition webpage serve as alternatives if the FBO website is unavailable. Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane Division plans to issue multiple purchase orders, Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) and/or Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contracts with Simmonds Precision (89305).  This class synopsis will cover multiple purchase orders issued for one year to include line items for include repairs, spares, modifications, upgrades, depot lay-ins in direct support of the C-130J and derivative Type Model Series (T/M/S) aircraft.  Procurements under this class synopsis will be conducted on a sole-source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  The basis for restricting competition is the proprietary information of Simmonds Precision (89305) and the duplicative cost to the Government to utilize another source to satisfy the Government's requirements.  The Government does not possess the Level III drawing package, specifications, test procedures, and test benches to allow f! or full and open competition.

<CONTACT>Michael Duffy, Contract Specialist, (973)724-6627

<a href="mailto:michael.duffy7@us.army.mil">Michael Duffy</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army Armament Research, Development & Engineering Center (ARDEC), Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000 is interested in receiving white papers from industry for adding a high precision capability to mortar and artillery munitions at low cost. The desired capability shall be accomplished through a Common Guidance and Control Module (CGCM) that could be used on different munitions with minimal modification for each application. The CGCM technology shall apply to indirect fire munitions ranging from 105mm to 155mm artillery shells and 81mm to 120mm mortar rounds. The objective of the white paper is to seek out the suitable CGCM technologies and capabilities in planning of the future Army Technology Base programs. 
Also see Special Notice W15QKN-09-Z-0304 for information regarding an Industry Day at Picatinny Arsenal on 6 Nov 2008.
High precision munitions capabilities are desired by the U.S. Army to reduce collateral damage, improve target attack efficiency under all conditions and reduce ammunition supply logistics burden. Past and present precision munition programs have proven to be expensive to execute, and the guidance and control system has been the main cost driver.  High cost has been a key decider in terminating programs or limiting production volume.  Guidance and control technology has matured to the point that we now have the opportunity to standardize and modularize the technology. With the economy of scale of the common design approach, CGCM can reduce the precision munitions development and fielding costs. For the U.S. Army, it is expected that the CGCM will provide a precision guidance capability to existing and planned (e.g. Interim Brigade Combat Team and Future Combat Systems) artillery and mortar systems ranging from 81mm (mortar) to 155MM (artillery). Based on emerging Army requirements, near term primary applications are 120mm Mortar and 105mm Artillery.  The main projectile application is HE or Combined Effects (e.g., anti-armor) with lethality equal to or greater than conventional projectiles.
It is expected that the CGCM to be more of a module than a kit in design. Module can be defined as part of a new or modified projectile concept. Kit is defined as a device that can be added to an existing projectile. CGCM can be used in multiple indirect fire applications with minimal modifications to the basic design. The module should include all active guidance, navigation and control components, safe and arm, fuze, and power source, Enhanced Portable Inductive Artillery Fuze Setter (EPIAFS) fuze and guidance setting interface, output for warhead initiation, projectile status query, manual fuze/Semi-active laser (SAL) setting capability and, if required, seekers, sensors and antennas. 
The Module should provide an autonomous guidance capability (e.g, GPS) with the following expected terminal delivery accuracy; objective - 50% of impacts within 5M of aimpoint; 90%  within 20M, threshold -  50% of impacts within 10M of aimpoint; 90% within 30M. The module should be upgradeable to include a SAL seeker or other man-in-the-loop (MITL) system to achieve about a 1.0 meter CEP or better. It should be modular in design, affordable, reliable, accurate, and versatile. The module needs to incorporate GPS counter-countermeasures (if GPS is used). Loss of or jamming of GPS in the terminal trajectory should not result in delivery errors increasing more than 100% over baseline (threshold, objective) delivery errors. Any MITL seeker will incorporate counter-countermeasures (CCM) against known and projected countermeasures (CM). Terminal trajectory shaping and ability to engage moveable targets are desirable. The module, when incorporated with the projectile, should be capable of providing a minimum of 0.5g maneuverability during the entirety of the terminal trajectory or be able to maneuver 100m within 1km range. Note: these are expectations and not requirements. Expectations are stated simply to assess the state of the possible for CGCM technology  base planning.
Interested parties are requested to address in their white papers how best their design solution can exceed, meet or come close to meeting the aforementioned CGCM design expectations.

<p>COMMERCIAL COMMODITY: DELIVER 1354 POUNDS OF HEALTHY TROUT TO WRIGHT-PATTERSON AFB OHIO IN ACCORDANCE WITH SPECIFICATIONS - REVISION O1 DATED NOVEMBER 03, 2008<br />1. SPECIFICATIONS: Before December 12, 2009 the contractor shall complete all phased deliveries of live, healthy rainbow trout ranging from a minimum weight per fish of 3/4 pound to maximum weight of 2 pounds to both lake locations on Wright-Patterson AFB, OH. Both the contractor and Government will use phone calls and FAX correspondence to confirm all scheduled delivery orders and any weather related changes to paragraph 2 (AS REQUIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE). All trout deliveries are inherently time sensitive and require seven calendar days before each scheduled delivery date due to changing lake water temperatures, water quality, fish eating habits and acclimation inherent with harvesting (weaning) affected by lake conditions. Within seven calendar days of each government-accepted delivery, the contractor shall guarantee no cost replacement of any fish deaths inherent with acclimation to lake conditions when the Government does not overly stress (abusively poke and weigh) delivered fish. To be eligible for this award each company shall provide the company's most current copy of annual State of Ohio Certification (License) to transport and sell live Rainbow Trout. The license must renewed and submitted as needed throughout the duration of the contract.<br />2. AS REQUIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE: Anticipated delivery dates and pounds delivered to Gravel Lake and Bass Lake on Wright-Patterson AFB, OH are phased (multiple) delivery orders. The contractor shall coordinate AS REQUIRED changes to phased delivery orders at least 24 hours prior to each delivery date. All deliveries shall be accepted during the same week for the following Not Later Than (NLT) dates; delivered pounds; and lake locations.<br />Phased (Multiple) Delivery Orders Pounds Lake Location<br />Phase 1, NLT November 18, 2008 400 Gravel Lake <br />Phase 2, NLT November 18, 2008 200 Bass Lake<br />Phase 2, NLT November 28, 2008 400 Gravel Lake<br />Phase 2, NLT November 28, 2008 354 Bass Lake<br />Total Deliveries NLT December 12, 2008 1,354<br />3. INSPECTION OF DELIVERIES: The Government Program Manager shall ensure herein designated Government inspector meets each contractor truck at Gravel Lake and Bass Lake for each confirmed delivery date. When flooding of Gravel Lake precludes contract truck access, the Government inspector shall ensure access for fish to be delivered to Bass Lake. The contractor shall weigh fish at the applicable lake delivery site. Contractually authorized Government Inspectors/Acceptor identified herein shall approve receiving reports the same day of each delivery. Inspectors will witness and verify contractor weighing during each fish delivery. After each fish delivery the contractor is prohibited from draining any residue fish tanks water on any lake shore.<br />Name, phone, and FAX number of contractually authorized Government Inspector/Acceptor:Name Karen Beason Phone (937) 257-5899 FAX (937) 656-1534, Dave Dalton 257-5060 Ann Lynch 257-2924<br />4. ACCESS TO LAKE DELIVERY SITES: Because this fish farm contractor shall require recurring access (escort) through the 88 Security Forces Squadron (SFS) controlled commercial vehicle gate to delivery sites, the contractor and Government Inspector/Acceptor shall mutually ensure this contractor complies with all current 88 SFS/SFOX (PASS AND REGISTRATION) BASE ACCESSS REQUIREMENTS.</p>

Narrow-Gap Improved Electroslag Welding of High Performance Steel for Bridges
A. Background
ASTM A709, Grade 70W high performance steel is being increasingly used for bridges in the United States. The Narrow Gap Improved Electroslag Welding process  (ESW-NG) developed under long term research sponsored by the Federal Highway Administration, developed in the 1980's and 1990's for welding conventional A36 and A588 structural steels is a greatly improved modification of conventional consumable guide electroslag welding. This research was conducted at the Oregon Graduate Institute (OGI), Beaverton, OR (FHWA technical report on ESW-NG; Number FHWA/RD-87/026, available from the Sales Department of the National Technical Information Service, telephone number 703-605-6000 or 800-553-6847, publication number PB89211056).  ESW-NG results in major increases in productivity in an already high productivity welding process, virtually eliminates weld defects, increases process reliability, and improves both weld metal and heat affected zone impact toughness. Fatigue tests on I-Beams demonstrated excellent fatigue properties.  
The previous research and the demonstrations that followed the research were limited to conventional steels.  Now, with the advent of high performance steels, there is an urgent need to determine whether or not Narrow Gap-Improved Electroslag (ESW-NG) welding process could be allowed for joining High Performance Steel (HPS) also.  The previously developed ESW-NG process consumables and welding conditions may have to be modified for joining HPS to ensure that welded joints thus made will be defect free and will have adequate strength and toughness in both the weld metal and heat-affected zones of the welded joints. 
The assessment of the weldment properties that can be achieved through the integration of both these new technologies, steel production and high productivity joining, needs to be carried out to determine the potential for, and the benefits of, ESW-NG  applied to HPS 70W.  The lack of preheating requirements, the extremely high weld productivity, and the cost effectiveness in thicknesses over 25 mm are strong drivers for use of the technology. Effective use of shop floor space and reduced plate handling also enhance fabrication efficiency.
The consumable development, while designed for conventional steels, will use the same wire  chemistry principles as those applied to welding HPS Gr 70W - low carbon and the use of Ni-Mo-Mn to develop high weld metal toughness and matching strength, while minimizing carbon content. The consumable chemistry will likely need to be slightly modified in order to match the 70 ksi strength level, since the weld metal strength for ESW-NG of A588 using the current weld metal chemistry is typically 68,000psi. and since the weld metal carbon content for A588 is typically around 0.09wt % carbon (after dilution from the base metal) and the carbon content for ESW-NG Gr70 is expected to be as low as 0.05wt %C. Some adjustment in the Ni-Mn- Mo levels can be anticipated in order to achieve a yield strength of between 72,000 psi and 74,000 psi. The second area of concentration will be to reduce the heat input to as low a level as can be practically and consistently achieved in order to maximize the heat affected zone properties.

C. Objectives
The primary objectives of this basic/applied research are to apply and extend ESW-NG practices and consumable development for application to HPS 70W. The two technical areas of concentration will be (1) evaluating consumable chemistry requirements and the resulting weld metal chemistry to achieve (a) a minimum 70 ksi strength level and (b) a weld metal microstructure with the maximum level of impact toughness, and (2) process modifications that will reduce the heat input to a minimum level that can be consistently and practically achieved in a production environment. For both objectives the starting baseline point of comparison will be the current wire chemistry and the current baseline recommended welding process parameters.
D. Requirements
Technical Approach
The Contractor’s  proposal shall delineate a technical approach taking into consideration of weld metal chemistry, grain structure and metallurgy and heat input which may influence mechnical properties of the weldment and heat affected zones (HAZ). Because there are a number of  variables that can influence heat input which can influence HAZ microstructure and properties, the technical approach and the assessment will be to maximize the mechanical properties. The assessment of the weld quality and HAZ should include the following factors at a minimum:
(1)	Application of  a thin metal sheath for the tubular metal powder cored electrode wire

(2)	Application of  multiple 1/16" diameter electrode wire rather than the typical single 3/32" diameter wire:

(3)	Application of multiple electrodes (2 versus 1) in order to reduce the current density for each wire

(4)	Increasing the water cooling effectiveness of the retaining shoes by increasing the water flow rate and by reducing the incoming water temperature 

The Government anticipates an approach which would focus on optimizing tensile properties and impact toughness while maintaining - consistency, reliability, defect free, and demonstrated fatigue behavior. 
Standards for the evaluation of test welds and specimens shall be consistent with tests required by the current AASHTO/AWS D1.5 Bridge Welding Code procedures and as noted below:
	Transverse Tensile Tests
	All Weld Metal Tensile Tests
	Radiographic Tests (RT) and Ultrasonic Tests (UT)
	Bend tests
	Weld metal and Heat Affected Zone Hardness Tests
	Weld metal Charpey V Notch (CVN) (8) mid thickness
	Heat Affected zone CVN (5) quarter thickness
weld and heat affected zone  macro and microstructure analysis
Additional analysis beyond standard D1.5 protocols will include weld metal chemistry.
The Government anticipates that initial weld samples shall be evaluated primarily for weld integrity, weld cross section profile, and dilution, rather than for tensile strength and toughness   and the full complement of D1.5 weld evaluation methods to fully evaluate the optimized HPS Gr 70W weldment  including HPS Gr70W to conventional structural steel, such as A588, hybrid weldments. 
The thickness of the weldments will be dependent on the available test plate material. Suitable  thicknesses range from about 38 mm (1.5") to 100 mm (4") thick.  Since HPS Gr. 70W is not available in 100 mm (4”) thickness, the Government anticipates that the Contractor shall make hybrid weldments using conventional steel up to 100mm (4”) plate and the second plate up to 76 mm(3”) HPS Gr70W.  The exact thickness shall be proposed by the Contractor based on the plate availability and as approval by the Government.  For estimating purposes two plate thicknesses are anticipated.
It is anticipated that the Contractor shalll conduct optimization development of welds, including required weld analysis resulting in a weld procedure designed to minimize heat input levels to the lowest practical level. and electrode and consumable guide chemistry modification resulting in ESW-NG welds that meet minimum tensile properties for HPS Gr70W. The Contractor shalll conduct detailed impact toughness tests on fully optimized welds per proposed AASHTO/AWS D1.5 specifications for ESW-NG.  Also, the Contractor shall evaluate mechanical properties of HPS optimized ESW-NG for hybrid welds (joining HPS to conventional steel).  All test results, findings and recommendations shall be compiled in a report. The Government may post this report on the FHWA Web site.  The contractor shall strictly follow FHWA Web posting protocols and 508 compliance. 
The Government anticipates a kick-off meeting and has capability of Web conferencing.  Kick-off Web conference meeting shall be to seek directions from the COTR and the FHWA advisory group. The FHWA Web conferencing services will be used at no cost to the Contractor.  The Contractor shall prepare a power point presentation and other necessary visuals to discuss the proposed work plan including a detailed (time) schedule for the test program. 
Based on the directions provided by the advisory group and upon approval by the Government, the Contractor shall update the work plan.  After the kick-off meeting, the following shall be provided to the CO and to the COTR:
(1)	Hard copy of the work plan 
(2)	Electronic copy of the work plan
(3)	The Contractor shall provide minutes of the meeting.  The COTR may post these minutes on the FHWA Web site.  The contractor will strictly follow FHWA Web posting protocols and 508 compliance. 

Test Matrix and Optimization of ESW-NG for HPS Gr70W 

The Government anticipates that the Contractor shall develop a test matrix consistent with the proposed research approach to produce sound optimized welds with tensile strength of that required for HPS Gr70W steel.   The number of weldments and conditions considered in the test matrix will be rationalized by the contractor.  
Web meetings with the FHWA Advisory Group

The Government anticipates that the Contractor shall utilize Web conference(s) (Web meetings).  The FHWA Web conferencing services shall be used at no cost to the Contractor to present to the COTR and the FHWA advisory Group power point presentation(s) and other necessary visuals to discuss the research progress, test program results, research findings and recommendations including any modifications to the test program.

Based on the directions provided by the advisory group and upon approval by the Government, after each web meeting, the Contractor shall update the test program and the work plan.  Following the Web conference(s) meeting(s), the following shall be provided to the CO and the COTR, as applicable:

(1)   Hard copy of the revised test program including modified test matrix and the updated work plan.

(2)  Electronic copy of the updated work plan and updated power point slides (maximum 36 slides) suitable for posting on the FHWA Web site for dissemination of the related technical information among State DOTs, industries and other users.
 
(3)   The Contractor will provide minutes of the meeting.  The COTR may post these minutes on the FHWA Web site.  The contractor will strictly follow FHWA Web posting protocols and 508 compliance.

After receipt, the final procedures for ESW-NG on HPS will be subject to peer or scientific review.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to post questions and answers from vendors.  THE DUE DATE IS EXTENDED TO WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 5, 2008, BY 12:00 P.M. CST.
Question
1) In Section 1.0, Requirement #192 states "Display repeatable events of the same occurrence together as one event". Can an example of this be provided for further clarification?
Response
For example, I have a table that records who made a decision regarding agency investment into a particular technology, what day it was made and what the actual decision was:Mr. Smith - 11-28-2008 - Mission Need ApprovedMs. Taylor - 11-29-2008 - Initial Investment ApprovedMr. Banks - 11-30-2008 - Promote to Final InvestmentThe entire row should be considered one repeatable event.  It should be able to be retrieved either as part of a table or as one discrete attribute of an asset.  I should be able to display this row together and ensure that I couldn't simply delete a part of it by accident and end up with the following:Mr. Smith - 11-28-2008 - Mission Need ApprovedMr. Banks - 11-29-2008 - Initial Investment Approved                   - 11-30-2008 - Promote to Final Investment
Question
2) In Section 1.0, Requirement #409 states "Convert the following document types to MS PowerPoint" and the formats are listed as follows: HTML, XML, PDF, Rich Text. We would like to validate the direction of conversion in this requirement is 'to' MS PowerPoint  as opposed to convert 'from' MS PowerPoint  to the formats listed. 
Response
The direction is correct.  There are also requirements to go from MS Powerpoint later in the document.
Question
3)  Does the Government intend to issue a follow-on RFP for this solicitation and will that document request a specific configuration and pricing?
If the Government issues an RFP, then documentation requesting specific configuration and pricing will be requested at that time.  No pricing is required for this phase.
NO PHONE CALLS!

<CONTACT>David C. Sedgley, Phone (919)541-4027, Fax (919)541-2712, Email sedgley@niehs.nih.gov
<DESC><p>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences is soliciting proposals, from all Small Businesses, for the National Toxicology Program (NTP) Technical Reports Preparation Support Services. This notice is, in essence, a re-issuance of a notice for solicitation NIHES2008017, which was cancelled for as a result of a NAICS Code appeal. The previous notice was cancelled after a NAICS Code appeal. The previous solicitation was under NAICS Code 541712, Research and Development. This notice and solicitation are under NAICS Code 511130, Book Publishers. The Contractor shall serve as a resource to the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences for the preparation of Public Health Service documents describing NTP studies of the toxicology and carcinogenicity of selected chemicals. The documents to be produced are generically known as Technical Reports, which are government-produced, peer-reviewed, book-style documents describing in full detail studies conducted and overseen by the NTP. Two principal kinds of reports will be produced, differing primarily in length and the type of review process they undergo. The first are book-length monographs (approximately 150 to 300 pages) that provide an overview of the literature on the biologic effects of a particular substance or set of chemicals and full details of the conduct, results, and interpretation of long-term (generally 2-year) NTP studies of the effects of the test chemical in rodents. The subject matters in these reports include general toxicology, animal physiology, histologic and clinical pathology, chemistry, genetics, and statistics, and may also on occasion include pharmacology, molecular biology, immunotoxicity, developmental and reproductive toxicology, or other related disciplines. Historically these reports have primarily consisted of Technical Reports on long-term carcinogenesis studies, but future reports, similar in size and complexity, may deal with other specialties such as reproductive or developmental toxicology. The short reports also describe a variety of toxicity studies in rodents, generally shorter in duration. Historically these reports have been NTP Toxicity Reports on short-term toxicity studies in rodents, but future reports may also deal with other specialties such as immunotoxicity. These reports are generally shorter in length (50 to 150 pages) and involve the same subject areas as the long reports. The Contractor shall work in concert, with NTP staff scientists and NTP contractors to provide technical writing, copy editing, proofreading, word processing, desktop publishing, graphics, file research, and record keeping services. File research is broadly defined as reviewing laboratory reports and extracting relevant experimental information and also capturing, downloading and reformatting files of tabular data. The Contractor shall engage in report preparation activities, at the direction of the Project Officer, for approximately 40 reports in various stages at one time. Each report will be prepared in a series of five or four drafts, each incorporating text, materials, and revisions from NTP staff. Each report will be presented for outside peer review at one of the intermediate draft stages; some reviews of Technical Reports are conducted in public session. The Contractor shall provide review draft reports for each draft stage and shall also prepare desk top publishing files for use by the Government and PDF and/or HTML files for display on the NIEHS World Wide Web servers. Approximately 24 reports shall be presented for review and printed each year; the Contractor should expect to commence preparation of approximately two reports per month and to deliver approximately two drafts per week. The Contractor should be prepared to provide flexibility in scheduling deliverables, in consultation with the Project Officer, to accommodate Program needs, particularly to accommodate the presentation of several (as many as eight to ten) reports for review at one time. The contractor shall archive all materials received, maintain a log of all materials received and delivered, and submit a biweekly status report detailing the status of each report in preparation and the cumulative labor hours spent on each report. All materials sent to the Contractor are considered the property of the Government, and are not be used for any other purpose. Each report shall follow a standard format and will contain a cover page, various front matter, (e.g. Note to the Reader; Title Page; Tables of Contents, Figures, and Tables; lists of contributors; and in later drafts, lists of reviewers and summary of reviewers comments and an overall summary) separate sections for an Abstract, Introduction, Materials and Methods, Results, Discussion, References, and various Appendixes. Page layout will include text, tables (both embedded in pages of text and multi-page data sets), line art graphics, and photomicrographs with captions. In various drafts, text may have different spacing and columniation. Pages will carry headers and/or footers identifying the report by name and number, draft status, and page number. At various draft stages the page numbering may be either numerically consecutive from the front or alphanumeric for individual appendixes. Contents and format requirements are subject to periodic revision by the Program and the Project Officer. Examples of currently produced reports are available for view under NTP Study Reports on the NTP website http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov. Reports are to be prepared with suitable software publishing package with the capability to incorporate the entire report, including all headings, text, tables, line art images, and photomicrographs, into a single file. The Contractor shall be able to produce hard copies, electronic files, and Portable Document (PDF) files of the entire report, or sections thereof, for use by the NTP. The contractor shall provide Section 508 Compliant web-optimized PDF files for those draft stages that will be placed on the NTP web site. The Contractor shall be able to receive and capture electronic files with text, graphics, and tables from a variety of sources, platforms, and programs. Electronic data accessing methods will include reading disks, e-mail attachments (originating both from Macintosh and PC platforms), and World Wide Web sites. These files may be in a variety of formats and programs, including but not limited to MS Word (various versions) for text files, Excel spreadsheets, and TIFF (Tagged Image File Format), GIF, or JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) files for photographs. The Contractor should also be able to read and capture text with citations incorporated in reference libraries (e.g., EndNote). The Contractor shall be responsible for ensuring the accuracy of transcription of any electronically converted or hand-keyed text or data. On occasion the Contractor may be asked to prepare graphical displays of data (e.g., time plots or bar graphs) or chemical structures and metabolism pathways. These should be prepared as transportable files with programs such as Photoshop for line art, Freehand for graphics, and Chem Draw or ISIS/Draw for chemical structures and not be embedded in a proprietary format. The contractor shall have the capability of scanning line art graphics (e.g., chemistry spectra, schematic diagrams) into electronic files at a resolution of 600-1200 dpi. In the event that photographs (rather than digital files) of photomicrographs are provided, the contractor shall have the capability of scanning the photograph at the original quality and producing a TIFF file at a final resolution of 300 dpi for color images or with gray tones for black and white images. For all graphics the contractor shall use programs that capture the required information in a file format without loss of quality of the image. During the report preparation process the Contractor shall be able to extract portions of entire sections or the report and send them as electronic files to NTP staff for review. The Contractor will certify that a written enforced administrative process to identify, manage, reduce and eliminate conflicting financial interest is currently in effect. The anticipated effective date of the subsequent award is January 1, 2009. The performance period for the base contract is expected to be 60 months. Should the Government choose to exercise the time extension options for continued support; the period may be extended to December 31, 2019. For estimating purposes the Government anticipated an approximate level-of-effort of 12 person-years per year for the length of the contract and for each one-year extension option. The Government anticipates the participation of a principal investigator, a production supervisor, senior science writers, technical writers/copy editor, desktop publishing specialists and clerical staff. There is no prescribed mix of writers/editors and or desktop publishing specialist, but rather bidders should develop a strategy and team they feel is appropriate for performing the required task. The expected release date of the RFP is July 10, 2008 with proposals due August 11, 2008 (per FAR 5.203(e)). Interested organizations should request a copy of the RFP in writing from David C. Sedgley, Contract Specialist, P.O. Box 12874, 79 T.W. Alexander Drive, Building 4401, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709; by telephone (919) 541-4027 or by FAX request (301) 435-2709. On the release date an online version of the RFP will be available on the internet in a PDF format attached to this synopsis. The proposed contract is 100% set aside for small business concerns.</p>
