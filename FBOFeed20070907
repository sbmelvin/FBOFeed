This purchase covers service support and component upgrades for existing equipment purchased in 2005.  Only the original manufacturer can provide the service support and upgrades.   Changing brand names would require all new equipment at considerable expense to the U.S. Government. DS/SI/CS/E&V has identified Fluke Network equipment as a key component.  The product/service to be procured is an upgrade of the Department of State's existing Fluke Optiview solution. Fluke Optiviews are manufactured exclusively by Fluke Networks. The Fluke Optiviews are the primary means of assesment for the purposes of computer security by the RCSO Program.  The RCSOs need to maintain cutting-edge tools to ensure the best possible assessment of our cyber-security posture, and the Fluke Optiview is the only meduim that combines the hardware/software accesibility in one single unit.  This is used by the Department of State, Diplomatic Security to investigate and assess network security.   As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the most cost effective means to meet the DS computer security assessment requirements. Fluke Networks is the only manufacturer of Fluke Optiviews and all maintenace, replacement, and spares must come from this source.<BR><BR>

<DESC>NASA/DFRC has a requirement for twelve 16HD miniature pressure scanners and accessories. These sensors are used to measure static pressure on the heat shield and outer mold line of the crew module. The specifications are: 16HD-0703020301 16HD miniature pressure scanner (qty 12) Purge Manifold 0.063, 90 deg, 0.35 Temperature sense with calibration +/- 15 psid Full Scale Pressure 1 FT cable length Standard output voltage (2)	TLCB-1000100000 TLCB ESP 16HD Adapter cable (qty 12) TLCB Cable to have Teflon jacket NASA/DFRC intends to purchase the items from Esterline Pressure Systems.  Drydens pressure calibration laboratory is already equipped with the interfaces necessary to calibrate these sensors. Also, the sensors currently being used are from the vendor Esterline Pressure Systems. Any other pressure system would require in-house development of the interface to the CEV data acquisition system. By replacing the current sensors with the same type from the same vendor, this will ensure savings through inoperability, parts sparing and resource sharing. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on September 22, 2007.	Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Department of Energy (DOE) intends to award a purchase order contract on a sole-source basis to U.S. Civilian Research & Development Foundation, under 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, for registering new users to the Iraqi Virtual Science Library (IVSL).

<DESC>Description:  HASSLER TYPE CORE HOLDER, RCHJR-1,1.5 DESC: The U.S. Department of Energyâs National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA intends to award a purchase order on a sole-source basis to the TEMCO Company for delivery to our site in Albany, OR for the following: 1.  HASSLER TYPE CORE HOLDER, RCHR-1.1.5; SPECIFICATIONS:  CORE DIAMETER: 1â, 1-1/2â, CORE LENGTH: 0-6â, WORKING PRESSURE: 5,000 PSI, WORKING TEMPERATURE: 300F, WETTED MATERIAL:  316SS, BODY MATERIAL: STAINLESS STEEL, SLEEVE MATERIAL: VITON 70 DUROMETER, OVERBURDEN PORT, 2 EACH, 1/8â NPT, FLUID INLET, 1 EACH, 1/8â NPT, FLUID OUTLET, 1 EACH, 1/8â NPT, CONFINING PRESSURE LOADING: HASSLER â 4 EACH. 2.  SPARE VITON SLEEVE, 1â DIA. â 4 EACH. 3.  SPARE VITON SLEEVE, 1-1/2â DIA. â 4 EACH. 4.  VITON O-RING SETS â 4 EACH. 5.  BP BACK PRESSURE REGULATOR, SPECIFICATIONS: MODEL #BP-50, WORKING PRESSURE: 100-5,000 PSI, WORKING TEMPERATURE: 200 F, WETTED MATERIAL: 316SS DIAPHRAGM: TEFLON, DOME FITTING: 1/8â NPT, INLET, OUTLET FITTING: 1/8â NPT â 4 EACH. 6.  SPARE TEFLON DIAPHRAGM â 4 EACH. This request is considered to be sole source to the TEMCO Inc. because we must obtain components to finalize construction of a high pressure, stirred reactor system for the geochemistry facility located in Albany, OR.  The purpose of this procurement is to contract the purchase of 4 Hassler type core holders and back pressure regulators for the geochemistry facility located in PDD. The TEMCO Inc. RCHR-1, 1.5 Hassler type core holders and back pressure regulators are to be used with supercritical fluid pumps in the PDD on the Geological Sequestration: Enhancement of Seals project located at the Albany campus.  The TEMCO Hassler core holders and back pressure regulators are already in use in the PDD with the existing TEMCO gas/liquid permeameter. Standardizing on one brand of core holder and back pressure regulators would simplify maintenance by minimizing the need to train and become familiar with multiple types of core holders and back pressure regulators.  The TEMCO core holders and back pressure regulators are certified for operation at the required temperature and pressure and in the existing permeameter equipment, a requirement for the SARS approval of the project activities.  Due to their compatibility with existing equipment, it makes good fiscal sense to make the TEMCO core holders and back pressure regulators the standard for this project. This vendor is the only US distributor on the TEMCO website for the TEMCO Hassler-type RCHR core holders and back pressure regulators, which are known to be compatible and exchangeable with existing equipment (TEMCO permeameter). Purchasing the Hassler holders will eliminate the need to modify existing equipment for use with new core holders and back pressure regulators.  As such, TEMCO Inc. is the appropriate vendor for the proposed contracted purchase. All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by this agency.  Firms who want to challenge the sole source must submit an interest letter that demonstrates the firmâs ability to provide the services or work described above.  Interested parties must provide rationale as to why they should be considered.  Interested parties shall provide sufficient technical literature, documents, etc., in order for the Government evaluation team to make an adequate technical assessment of the quote as meeting technical acceptability. All interested firms must respond to DE-RQ26-07NT001133 by 05:30 P.M. EST, September 22, 2007.  Therefore, no solicitation will result from this announcement.  The North American Industrial Classification Code (NAIC) is 334512.  This award shall be made using FAR 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.    This is a small business set-aside.  Request for information should be addressed to Mr. Robert L. Mohn, FAX 412-386-5770 or E-mail at mohn@netl.doe.gov.  The Technical Representative for the above requirement is Mr. William OâConnor at 541-967-5834, e-mail William.OâConnor@nelt.doe.gov.

HORIBA ENDA E4500 CEM System with sample conditioning systems for measuring NOX, SO2, CO, CO2 and O2.  The system has 13 channels of analog inputs and 8 discrete digital inputs and 16 channels of analog outputs and 64 discrete digital outputs for integration into the data acquisition and process control systems â 1 each. This request is considered to be sole source to the HORIBA Instruments Inc because we must obtain a system that will be interfaced with an identical HORIBA SYSTEM that NETL already owns.  The systems are used with a specially designed data acquisition and process control system designed and built by NETL that is not compatible with other analyzers.  It must be compatible with the operating conditions and software of the existing system. It must physically interface with the existing government equipment without modification that would void or limit the existing warrantee.  All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by this agency.  Firms who want to challenge the sole source must submit an interest letter that demonstrates the firmâs ability to provide the services or work described above.

Per AFFARS 5352.201-9101: An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official.  Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.  Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.  Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).  If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Michael R. Jackson, HQ AMC/A7K, 507 Symington Drive, Scott AFB, IL 62225-5022, (618) 229-0267, fax (618) 256-6668, e-mail: michael.jackson@scott.af.mil. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.  The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.  Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements.  Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.

<DESC>The SMA Project (http://www.smaproject.org) seeks to identify facilities to conduct preclinical testing of chemical compounds with the ultimate goal of submitting an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
Studies to be conducted under the resulting contract will include preclinical safety, toxicology, pharmacokinetic/dynamic, and biodistribution studies with candidate small molecule compounds that act as therapeutic agents for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).  While a broad range of Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) and non-GLP studies is anticipated, capability to conduct studies according to GLP is required.  Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), on behalf of the Government, shall supply the Offeror with a small amount of each candidate therapeutic compound.  For certain compounds provided to the Contractor, SAIC may request a comprehensive Product Development Plan for services to be provided by the Contractor.
Facilities will be evaluated on their past experience in preclinical, IND-directed small molecule development, as well as the proposed schedule and cost of studies required.
Offers are due by 3 p.m. Eastern Time on October 5, 2007.  The Request for Proposals and relevant documents can be accessed through the Solicitations page of the SMA Project website at http://www.smaproject.org/solicitations.html.     

The National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) (http://www.ninds.nih.gov/) launched The SMA Project: A Collaborative Program to Accelerate Therapeutics Development for Spinal Muscular Atrophy in September 2003. This program funds milestone-driven research aimed at identifying and rapidly developing a treatment for SMA, a paralyzing neurodegenerative disease of childhood.

SAIC is supporting the NINDS in the management of this program. Any responsible Offeror may submit a proposal to be considered by SAIC.

<DESC>Request for Information: Point of Contact: 	Shawn Mitchell 			Contracting Officer 			NAVICP  Code 0271.F1 			Mechanicsburg PA 17055-0788 			Office 717-605-4046 			Email: shawn.r.mitchell@navy.mil This is not an announcement of an upcoming solicitation. The Naval Inventory Control Point  Mechanicsburg (NAVICP-M) invites industry sources to provide an approach for sustaining, enhancing, and integrating  the Joint Technical Data Integrated (JTDI) System and other Tactical Logistics Information Technology (IT) programs that are interrelated and that compliment the Naval Air System Commands (NAVAIR) goal to continually improve aviation logistics systems and information system support of customers.  NAVICP requests interested industry sources provide industry input outlining your approach, ideas, issues and questions with particular emphasis on  the Statement of Objectives  (available at  http://govauctions.procuri.com), the utilization of technology opportunities, applying information assurance (IA) , and approaches for integration with weapon systems. A  Small Business Set-Aside procurement under an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract structure is !  anticipated.   Additional information can be obtained from the point of contact (POC) identified in this announcement. Comments/questions should be uploaded at the website cited above by 17 September 2007. The electronic Government/Contractor communication tool will be utilized to process for this effort.  Please register as a "Supplier" at www.govauctions.procuri.com.  After registration, please send an email at Andrew.r.clarke@navy.mil and he will then provide your access to the system.  After he provides access, you will receive an email from the eprocuri system inviting you to participate in the procurement.   INFORMATION ON THE E-PROCUREMENT SYSTEM      The below information is provided on the eProcuri system that will be utilized to process subject proposal.  Any questions, please direct them to the Contracting Officer. NAVICP 027 utilizes an electronic communication tool called the eProcurement/eProcuri tool.  This tool  is a web based site that is utilized as 027's Request for Information (RFI), Request for Proposal (RFP) and Request for Quote (RFQ), posting and  communication tool between the Government and the Contractor.  NAVICP posts RFI's/RFP's/RFQ's to the eProcurement tool and then directs interested Contractors to register on eProcuri to view the information. The web site indicates this is a Government Auctions site, however, it is very rarely used as such and is basically an RFI/RFP/RFQ, Contractor/Govt communication tool.      The first step for a Contractor is to register as a "supplier" on the web site "www.govauctions.procuri.com.  The Contractor is then registered in to the big empty eprocuri mailbox.  The Contractor must then contact the Contracting Officer supporting the RFI/RFP/RFQ and request access, indicating the RFI/RFP or RFQ number or subject matter. The Contracting Officer then inputs data to provide the Contractor access to the RFI/RFP/RFQ information posted to the tool.  The Contractor will then receive an email from the eProcurement system providing a "hyperlink" to access the system.  Each and every time the Contractor  accesses the system, the email must be opened and the hyperlink clicked, which will take the Contractor directly in to the site. The "link" cannot be pasted or typed in to a browser or saved as a favorite or the system will ask for a usarid and password. We use the easy hyperlink as we do not support administration of usarid's and passwords.   If at any time the Contractor loses the email, upon request, the Contracting Officer can easily send another access key.    Once the Contractor accesses the site, the information posted for the particular RFI/RFP or RFQ will be viewable under the event review menu. The Contracting office utilizes eprocuri to post all RFI/RFP or RFQ information, to provide information emails directly through the system to the Contractor, to accept vendor questions through the collaboration menu, to accept Contractor uploads such as technical and price proposals.  All the Government supplied information or Contractor provided submission information is uploaded against a particular RFI/RFP or RFQ and is therefore self contained in its own workload box. Contractor document uploads and questions are only viewable by the Contracting Officer.      At times the Contractor may receive a message from eProcuri, upon trying to access the RFI/RFP, that "access is denied in its current state".  The Contracting officer inputs suspense dates to the system based on the acquisition cycle and for a day or so here and there, access will be denied until the system is re-opened by the Contracting Officer. The eProcuri help desk # is 877-360-7609.

Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by NSWC Crane. You may also access information on the NSWC Crane Division web site at http://www.crane.navy.mil/supply/homepage.htm. Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane Division plans to enter into a 5-year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), firm-fixed price, supply contract with NMC Wollard Incorporated, Eau Claire, WI 54703 for repair parts/components (see attachment) for NMC Wollard Tow Tractors, Model(s) MD60 & MD140.  A commercial solicitation will be issued IAW FAR Part 12, using other than full and open competition to NMC Wollard IAW FAR 6.302 and the procedures at FAR 13.5.  Delivery will be FOB Destination. Inspection and acceptance will be at Destination by Government personnel. The proposed contract action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, NMC Wollard Inc., under the authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. The basis for restricting competition is that design and drawings for these parts are owned by NMC Wollard, Incorporated; fit, form, and functional compatibility with current Government assets and the duplicative cost to the Government to utilize another source to satisfy the Government requirements.   Interested parties may respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Department of the Navy, Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, San Diego intends to solicit and award a Cost Plus Fixed Fee, Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity contract to Maine Secure Composites LLC (MSC), 20 Godfrey Dr. Orono, ME 04473-3610 on a sole source basis. The purpose of this action is to complete the research and development requirements for composite technology in container security. The action is a follow-on to a previous contract with MSC, N66001-05-C-6014, awarded under the competitive Homeland Security Advanced Research Project Agency (HSARPA) Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) 04-06 published on 7 May 2004. The government seeks the completion effort of the development and test prototype of the Composite Anti-Tamper Container, a container constructed of composite material that will detect an intrusion and meet or exceed the physical characteristics required to survive in the shipping environment. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals or quotes. A determination by the Government not to compete based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. MSC's composite container technology makes it the only source that would not result in the duplication of cost. Because of the short-term need for the MSC procurement, the added cost would not be recovered through competition. Note 22 applies. Questions concerning this sole source contract action may be directed to Curtis F. Allen at curtis.allen1@navy.mil.

<DESC>This proposed procurement is a continuation of an existing contractual agreement for an independent assessment of NASAs focus on return to flight and implementation of the President Bushs new vision, the Assistant Administrator of the Office of Diversity and  Equal Opportunity (ODEO) has developed strategic plans to implement the Agencys EEO requirements and  processes and revitalize the Alternative Dispute Resolution program to help NASA create a work culture where managers, supervisors and employees will have a constructive and expeditious way to work together to resolve workplace disputes.  ODEO strategic plans are designed to comply with the regulatory requirements of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), as well as to address the mandates of the NASA Administrator and meet the evolving needs of the NASA community. Since the stand up of the NASA Shared Service Center (NSSC) both Stennis Space Center, EO Office and ODEO have been providing EO services to NSSC, as needed. However, workforce constraints currently prohibit the ODEO and other Center EO offices from providing staff to assist the NSSC in their requirements. Therefore, ODEO must have an experienced consultant available and accessible to serve as the designated Equal Opportunity (EO) Officer for the NASA Shared Service Center.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate on a sole source basis with JAD Enterprises, Inc.   JAD Enterprises, Inc. has over 30 years of experience working in NASAs EO environment, and is therefore knowledgeable about EO processes and issues and possesses firsthand knowledge of NASAs vision, mission, protocol, and Center work cultures.  Additionally, in the past, JAD Enterprises, Inc. has provided under contract technical advice to the NASA Installation EO Officers on EO and diversity issues and is uniquely aware of certain high level and sensitive issues.  JAD Enterprises has under a current contract commenced implementation of an effective EO program, in line with the agency wide requirements, at the NSSC, and has participated and provided valuable insight to the ODEOs Agency Strategic planning and implementation. This procurement is a sole source modification to an existing effort under contract with JAD for a continuation of those same services.	JAD Enterprises has experience assisting and developing the Model EO Agency Plan (EEOC MD 715). Based upon JAD current initiatives and implementation of the projects he has put into place, having to recreate and re-initiate what JAD has already commenced would add additional costs to the government.  JAD Enterprises, Inc. expertise in the area of NASAs Equal Opportunity Officer for the NASAs NSSC makes JAD uniquely qualified to perform this effort. To try and duplicate this effort is not feasible given the types of experience necessary and the time allotted for this effort to be performed.  It is in the best interest of the government to continue with the current contactor because of duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. NASA/HQ intends to award a purchase order for continued performance of specialized services to JAD Enterprises, Inc.  The authority is FAR 6.302-1 (b)(iii) "For DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, unique supplies or services available from only one or a limited number of sources or from only one or a limited number of supplies with unique capabilities. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing, by FAX or E-Mail, to the identified point of contact not later than 12:00 p.m. local time on September 14, 2007. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.
The National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Office of     Acquisitions (OA), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Altum Inc 11718 Bowman Green Drive Reston, VA 20190. Altum, Inc. is the only contractor with the expertise and experience to maintain and support both the Clinical Data Entry and Query System (CDEQ) and Monkey Business (MB) for the NIAID Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology (LMM) in a manner that addresses the required efficiency, economy and urgency of the project.

This AIDS non-human primate research support project involves the continued enhancement and maintenance of database and web application technology in support of Dr. Malcolm Martin?s research program at the Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, NIAID/DIR. Both MB and CDEQ are mission critical systems that support not only the LMM animal inventory and procedure scheduling but also act as repository of all the experimental data obtained from this. Over a period of more than 10 years, Altum has created both systems for the management and tracking of animals? availability and analysis of lab results.

CDEQ was developed using a Commercial-Off-The-Shelf system, Infor MPC. Altum is the only contractor that has Infor MPC certified implementation consultants at NIH as well as experience accumulated over the past ten years with LMM. In particular, Altum is the sole distributor of Infor MPC to the federal government. Altum provides the software, the expertise in implementing it, as well as maintenance, support, and training.

As a result, Altum is the only contractor with the institutional knowledge, in-place staff, experience, and skills required to meet the objectives of this task.

The sole source determination is based on  Altum?s institutional knowledge, in place staff, experience and access to the in infrastructure to perform this task. Altum is required to respond to unforeseen system problems, which may arise out of maintaining a legacy application such as Monkey Business, which was deployed in 1997. In addition, this legacy system is integrated with the new CDEQ system. Thus, the contractor needs to have expertise in both new and old technologies as well as experience with the existing system in order to efficiently provide programming support for the system.  Therefore, an award to any other source cannot be made which will result in a compatible product.    The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurement.     


The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition, procedures, and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6.     The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 541511 and the Standard Size is $23.0(million). This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this requirement. Responses to this announcement, referencing synopsis number   NOI7129   may be submitted to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Office Acquisitions, 10401 Fernwood Rd Suite 2NE70    Bethesda, MD 20892-7902,     Attention: Jemal Williams Fax quotations will only be accepted if dated and signed by an authorized company representative.

<DESC>1. The 853d Electronic Systems Group (853 ELSG), 641st Electronic Systems Squadron (641 ELSS), Landing Systems program office located at Electronic Systems Center (ESC), Hanscom AFB, MA is requesting information from industry to assist in the planning for the development and procurement of D-ILS.   D-ILS is envisioned to provide an equivalent fixed based Instrument Landing System (ILS) capability at tactical airfields and will also provide a fixed based ILS restoral capability (e.g., natural disaster or humanitarian relief efforts). The Department of Defense (DOD) transformation vision relies heavily on more expeditionary, adaptable, enduring/persistent and agile joint forces, which in turn places increased emphasis on aviation assets for deployment, employment, sustainment and redeployment. 2.  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  It is not a Request for Proposal, a Request for Quotation, an Invitation for Bids, a solicitation, or an indication the US Air Force (AF) or ESC will contract for the items contained in the RFI.  ESC will not pay respondents for information provided in response to this RFI. 3.  This RFI is part of a Government market research effort to determine industry capabilities to develop and produce a D-ILS beginning in early FY08 and extending at least through FY10. Air Traffic Control and Landing Systems (ATCALS) transformation plans notionally call for completing system development and testing in FY09 and procuring up to 20 systems in FY10. CONDITIONS: The D-ILS may be used in conjunction with a deployable Airport Surveillance Radar (ASR), Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN) or both, to provide guidance to the final approach path; the D-ILS may arrive at its operating location by airdrop, sling load, aircraft, ship, overland vehicle transport or a combination of these methods; a site survey may be required to identify the best location for the equipment, and the data will be passed to Terminal Instrument Procedures (TERPS) personnel for development of approaches;  equipment setup by two persons should be accomplished regardless of environment; the operato!  rs may be wearing cold weather gear or possibly a chemical warfare ensemble; the D-ILS must be capable of passing Operational Fight Inspection per FAA Order 8200.1C.  Please provide formal responses to the tasks listed below.  Address your capabilities to accomplish the below tasks and provide highlights of successful past experience on similar government contracts within the past 5 years.  a.	Describe your capability to develop and manufacture a D-ILS. Description of capabilities should include your experience developing and fielding other tactical and fixed precision landing systems or other navigational aids.   b.	Describe your capability to develop and conduct a D-ILS operator and maintenance training course.  Training may be conducted at both CONUS and OCONUS sites.  c.	D-ILS requirements will include the need for a remote maintenance capability which allows authorized remote maintainers to have full access to the system for monitoring, diagnostics, and system operating parameter adjustments.  This remote maintenance capability may be at the location where the system is installed or at a central location where maintainers will have responsibility for multiple systems.   Describe your experience in successfully incorporating remote maintenance in other systems or ATCALS equipment. d.	The D-ILS requirements will include a 15 year warranty and a ship-within-24-hours-of-notification turn around time for replacement parts.  Describe your experience implementing this type of logistics on ATCALS or other products.  e.	What is your estimated ramp-up time from contract award to first article test? 4.  Please provide your response electronically on no more than five single-sided, single-spaced pages using 12-point, Times New Roman font, and minimum one-inch margins, in Microsoft® Word or compatible format.  Responses to this RFI are requested by close of business on 28 Sep 2007.  All responses shall be unclassified and reviewed to ensure consideration of operational sensitivities.  All RFI responses and correspondence related to this matter should be e-mailed (preferred), or mailed to: 853rd ELSG (Attn: Mr. Richard Sheppard) 75 Vandenberg Drive Hanscom AFB, MA 01731-2103 E-mail: richard.sheppard@hanscom.af.mil Voice: (781) 377-4322 5.

NEPRA Capacity Building Technical Assistance.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop technical assistance for reviewing NEPRA's tariff determination practices for various technologies/fuels, especially as they relate to renewables, and propose suitable modifications/changes in the determination process.  This assistance seeks to enhance renewable energy sector strategies, industry standards, and legal and regulatory regimes, which in turn will help create a favorable business and trade environment for renewable energy development in Pakistan.

The Government of Pakistan (GOP) is seeking to utilize indigenous renewable energy sources such as water, wind, municipal solid waste, and others, in order to provide savings over more costly power generation that is based on imported gas, coal and fuel oil.  In 2006, the GOP announced an energy policy that seeks to increase the share of power generated from non-hydro renewable energy sources from less than 1%, where it stands today, to 10% by 2015.

The grant will fund Technical Assistance to investigate renewable energy project issues, and will recommend, among other things, tariff-setting procedures, changes to the legal framework affecting the renewable energy sector, and organizational improvements to NEPRA.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $263,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to: <b><a href=https://www.ustda.gov/USTDA/FedBizOpps/RFP/rfpform.asp>https://www.ustda.gov/USTDA/FedBizOpps/RFP/rfpform.asp</a></b>.  Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 3:00PM, LOCAL TIME November 1, 2007 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>B - Pakistan: 5-10 MW Waste-to-Energy Plant Feasibility Study 

POC Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009. PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE; PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE : Brig Dr. Nasim A. Khan, Secretary/Member Technical, Alternative Energy Development Board, 344-B, Prime Minister's Secretariat, Islamabad, Pakistan, Phone: 92-51-9223427 / 92-51-9008504, Fax: 92-51-9205790, Email: isesps_pk@yahoo.com 5-10 MW Waste-to-Energy Plant Feasibility Study. The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for the evaluation of the technical and financial merits of establishing a 5-10 MW waste-to-energy (WTE) power plant near Karachi.  The proposed WTE plant would address the environmental issues associated with municipal solid waste disposal, as well as the critical power shortages facing Pakistan.

Karachi, Pakistan's largest city (pop. 14 million), generates about 7,500 tons of municipal solid waste (MSW) per day.  This MSW is presently handled by several private contractors and is dumped at multiple landfill sites in and around the city.  The city's population continues to expand rapidly, and has resulted in an urgent need to address the environmental problems associated with air and water pollution through proper MSW management and disposal, as well as increased demand for electric power.  The proposed WTE plant would help address the power needs and the environmental concerns of Karachi, while at the same time generating a source of income for the city.  

Nationwide, Pakistan's installed power generating capacity is about 19,000 MW, which is insufficient to meet current energy demand.  Furthermore, many plants are in a poor state of repair and load shedding is increasingly common.  In 2006, the Government of Pakistan (GOP) announced an energy policy that seeks to address the power shortfall, in part, by utilizing indigenous renewable energy resources.  The Alternative Energy Development Board (AEDB), which was established in 2003 and reports to the office of the Prime Minister, is responsible for promoting the use of renewable energy in the face of increasing power shortages and mounting bills for imported fuel.  Its main objective is to facilitate, promote and encourage the development of renewable energy in Pakistan.  The AEDB is looking to increase the share of power generated from non-hydro renewable energy from less than 1%, where it stands today, to 10% by 2015, and seeks to do so through a market-based environment that is conducive to private sector investment and participation.

The Feasibility Study will look at the least-cost assessment of MSW disposal options and site identification for the WTE plant, prepare detailed cost/implementation schedule estimates and tender documents, assess environmental and developmental impacts, and perform legal, regulatory, financing, and institutional reviews.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $325,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

<DESC>The Office of Justice Programs (OJP), Bureau of Justice Statistic (BJS) intends to issue a delivery order on a sole source basis to FigLeaf Software, 1400 16th Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20036,  to provide continued support for the Data Online backend update and edit utility and to provide such capabilities for new data tables as they are added to the data warehouse.  Support for this utility shall include trouble shooting problems on the BJS installation, providing information to the OJP OCIO concerning the operation and maintenance of the utility, and providing improvements to the existing interface.   Providing such capabilities for new tables will occur after the table has been added to the data warehouse on our development environment.  The specifications for each table and interface for both updating and editing will be created by the contractor and approved by BJS prior to proceeding to development.  We anticipate the addition of up to twenty new tables during the next year.  The tables will vary in size; many include State-by-State and regional data over time, while others will present local agency data.  The BJS mission is to collect, analyze, publish, and disseminate information on crime, criminal offenders, victims of crime, and the operation of justice systems at all levels of government. These data are critical to Federal, State, and local policymakers in combating crime and ensuring that justice is both efficient and evenhanded. Since 1996, BJS has operated a website http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/) to facilitate its dissemination efforts. Figleaf Software, Inc. created the update and edit utility used by BJS under a subcontract.  Because they created the application, we feel that they are uniquely qualified to provide maintenance and extend the application to new additions to the data warehouse.   In addition, the subcontractor, Figleaf Software, maintains a mirror of both the production and development environments for Data Online.  This mirroring ensures that the software works as intended and facilitates trouble shooting when problems are encountered.  Creation of similar mirrors by other contractors would take a considerable investment of time and money.  Also, BJS staff would also be required to run acceptance tests on the contractor?s site which could delay implementation by many months.   The current contractor is the original programmer of the custom application and is thereby expertly qualified to provide a quick completion of the modernization of the application.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS.  However, all responsible parties who identify their interest and capability to satisfy this requirement will be considered.  No solicitation will be issued, therefore, all requests for the solicitation will be considered non-responsive.  A determination not to compete this action based upon responses received is in the sole discretion of the Government.  All interested parties must express their interest and capabilities in writing to OJP, 810 7th Street, NW, Room 3626, Washington, DC 20531, Attn : Karen L. Washington, by facsimile at (202) 307-0086 or by email at  Karen.Stringfield@usdoj.gov  within 5 days of the published date of this notice.  Documents over 10 pages in total will not be accepted by facsimile.  Verification of receipt of fax and email transmission is the sole responsibility of the contractor. All OJP contractors are required to register in the DOD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to receipt of award.  If no competitive responses are received, an award will be made to FigLeaf Software.

<DESC>The 12th Contracting Squadron at Randolph AFB intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis with Sound Distributors, Inc. 4242 N Pan Am Expressway, San Antonio, Texas 78218 for a complete upgrade to an existing Public Address/Video/Audio System.  This is a streamlined combined/synopsis/solicitation for a commercial item prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.

This notice constitutes the only notice. A written solicitation will not be issued.  This requirement is issued as a request for quote to Sound Distributors, Inc. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-19.  The resultant award will be firm fixed-price.

The NAICS Code is 443112, the size standard is $8M. 

IAW 13.501(a)(1)(ii) this requirement is a sole source acquisition under the authority of the test program for commercial items (section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996).

SOLE SOURCE NATURE OF ACQUISITION:

The Officer?s Club at Randolph AFB, TX hosts numerous conferences throughout each year and needs a reliable, user-friendly, quality audio system.  This entails a major upgrade to the existing audio system.  The new system must tie in to the current paging/
announcement system while permitting independent use by conference attendees in several other rooms throughout the club.  The quality of sound must be of the highest level and will come through a combination of existing hardware and speakers, and newly supplied equipment.  New equipment must be flexible enough to work with the existing equipment and be able to accept additional equipment from external sources.  The new equipment proposing to be furnished/installed is listed at Attachment 1.

Sound Distributors, Inc. is the supplier of the current equipment and has provided the wiring and maintenance for sound systems in the club since the late 1980?s.  They are familiar with the facility and the oddities of working in the 77-year old building which covers over 40,000 square feet on three floors.  They have worked with the challenges of walls that can be more than 2 feet thick. They know where they have working space in the ceiling, crawl space below the floor, and where they do not. The decades long supplier relationship of both equipment and maintenance makes them uniquely qualified to meet the club?s needs.  

Any responsible sources who can provide the above requirement at the prices, terms and conditions, equal to or better than those which can be provided by Sound Distributor Inc should submit clear
and convincing data in writing substantiating an ability to furnish the entire requirement.  Any responses to this notice must be received by this office by 21 Sep 07.

JUSTIFICATION:

1.	Statutory authority: Statute: 13.106-(b)(1) and 13.501(a)(1)

(b)    Soliciting from a single source.

(1)	For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization).  

(2) 	For Sole source acquisition of commercial items in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold conducted pursuant to subpart 13.5, the requirements at 13.501(a) apply.

The Solexa clonal single molecular array technology combined with their sequencing-by-synthesis (SBS) technique on the Solexa 1G Genome analyzer can identify perfectly 25 bp sequence tag from each DNA molecule in a library and therefore allow investigators to identify the specific sequence of up to 1 gigabases in a single run.  There are no other manufacturers known to the NCI that have either not yet marketed or are not capable of producing this number of DNA sequencing reads in a single run (20 million sequences).  Without this efficient identification of DNA regions, the NCI cannot complete the studies on the function of chromatin, the regulation of genome expression, or the analysis of mutations in cancer specimens.  The Solexa Genome Analysis System is solely manufactured and distributed by Illumina, Inc.    The Solexa CSMA (Clonal Single Molecule Array), cluster growth, and sequence detection are internationally patented processes.  Solexa (now part of Illumina) holds these patents. 

To meet rapidly emerging needs of NCI investigators, the acquisition of the Solexa Genetic Analyzer Solexa is necessary for the continued successes of NCI research and studies. This instrument (manufactured by Illumina) can generate 20 million sequence reads and 1 gigabase of total sequence. The applications of this technology in cancer research are far-reaching, including exon characterization, genome location analysis of regulatory factors, and gene expression analysis by sequence tags. 

This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI contracting office by 1:00 PM ET on August 17, 2007.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov.  No collect calls will be accepted.    Please reference NCI-70119-NG on all correspondence.

<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service intends to extend the term of the Treasury Communications System (TCS) contract number TIRNO-95-D-00099 with Northrop Grumman Information Technology, Inc. for two 12 month option periods pending the competitive award of the follow-on contract.  The TCS contract will expire September 27, 2007.  The Department of the Treasury does not anticipate award and complete transition of all sites before this contract expires.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is Section 303(c) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended by the Competition in Contracting Act [41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1)], implemented under FAR 6.302-1(a) which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The Department of the Treasury has a continuing need for Wide Area Network (WAN) communications capabilities.  The extension of the TCS contract allows for uninterrupted WAN communications capabilities for the Department of the Treasury.  This extension enables Treasury to mitigate risks to the nation?s financial infrastructure and allows for successful transition to the follow-on contract.  This is not a solicitation for proposals or an invitation for bids.  The Government does not anticipate receiving responses to this notice of a non-competitive action.  If parties choose to respond, any cost associated with preparation and submission of data or any other cost incurred in response to this announcement are the sole responsibility of the respondent and will not be reimbursed by the Government.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Question 1:  In Section IV Part 14I, the RFP states that light bulbs will be replaced.  According to DOL labor rules a Janitor can not do this task.  A Maintenance Mechanic or Electrician is required for this work.  Is it the Government's intent to expand the scope of the contract to include more than janitorial work?

Answer 1:  This was an oversight on the Governments part.  The contractor will not be required to replace light bulbs; however if they break light bulbs or light fixtures, it will be the contractor?s responsibility to replace/purchase the light bulbs or light fixtures.  The contractor should report any light bulbs or light fixtures that need to be replaced (these are broken or burnt) to the COR.

Question 2:  Similarly in Section IV Part 15 various requirements also call for a Maintenance Mechanic to perform such requirements as (but not limited to) remove and reinstall blinds and cleaning the interior of light fixtures.  Is it the Government?s intent to expand the scope of the contract to include more than janitorial work?

Answer 2:  This was an oversight on the Governments part. 
Section IV, Part 15.B.v.2. will be replaced with the following statement:  Wash all interior windows.  All film, dirt, smudges shall be removed.  Clean Venetian Blinds in all rooms with polished or damped cloth to remove dust and residue.

Statements that refer to Light Fixtures will read as follows:  Visually inspect all exposed light fixtures and all accessible components and report if they are dirty, dusty, or have trapped dead bugs and report bulbs that need replacement.

Question 3:  In Section IV Part 15 there are requirements such as (but not limited to) cleaning and waxing of cabinets in the laboratories, as well as removing, cleaning and reinstalling blinds.  Normally it is not the responsibility of a janitor to do work in a laboratory beyond picking up trash, sweeping, mopping and waxing of floors because of dangers present to an untrained person in such an environment.  Chemicals, organic and inorganic compounds, and other potentially dangerous situations may be present on or in benches and cabinets.  These should only be dealt with by laboratory personnel trained and knowledgeable of the individual circumstances in each lab.  Is it the Government's intent to expand the scope of the contract to include more than janitorial work?

Answer 3:  It is not the intent to expand the scope of the contract to include more than janitorial work.  There are some labs at these facilities that do not keep "Chemicals, organic and inorganic compounds, ? present on or in benches and cabinets."  The scope of the contract requires the cleaning, waxing, and wiping of the outside of the cabinets due to the amount of dust brought in from the field.  If there are such labs that do have "Chemicals, organic and inorganic compounds, and other potentially dangerous situations?" these labs will be handled differently.   We do not expect the contractor to clean above or around the glass of an active fume hood.   We would also not expect cleaning that requires the contractor to move documents; there may be times when the contractor cannot perform their job around experiments or in rooms that have active sensitive experiments; and/or in rooms where there may be situations that prohibits the contractor to perform their job; these will be addressed at the time of the occurrence.   

Question 4:  Will storage space be provided at each location or will the contractor be required to transport materials on and off site?

Answer 4:  There is storage space.

<DESC>This amendment/modification is to provide questions and answers to include layout. 1.  Question:    Will this job require installation? Answer:  YES 2.  Question:  Is there an option for a galvanized product? Answer:  YES 3.  Question:  Will the Buy American Act form a part of this solicitation? Answer:  Yes. 4.  Question:  Request to provide layout of the future system to determine how many uprights are single row in order to verify the need for cross-aisle ties or oversized footplates. We need to know the beam levels for each bay to determine if we need to double our columns and to what height? Answer:  Attached layout downloaded. 5.  Question: Height of First shelve level above floor, is beam capacity 5,000lbs per level  or per beam? Answer:  PER LEVEL 6.  Question: Where is the average pallet weight(for example, they may have an occasional pallet weighing 5,000lbs, but most pallets weigh 1,000lbs)? Answer: NOT ALL PALLET WEIGH 1K LBS BUT NO MORE THAN 5K LBS 7.  Question: Are all the frames/uprights to be tied together back-to-back? (The calculations will confirm that 2 row spacers per pair of uprights is sufficient). Answer: YES 8.  Question:   The wire decking- confirm the weight capacity per deck (eg: 2 decks per storage level for 5,000 lbs per shel/level is 2500lbs)? Answer:  Layout provided. 9.  Question:  We would also like to verify that all the pallet racking will be back to back and that the uprights should have a capacity of 38k but the total capacity will 15k base upon three levels at 5K per bay? Answer: YES 10.  Question:  Will each level be evenly spaced on the uprights? Answer:  YES 11.  Question:   The capacity on the uprights will depend on the beam spacing. I would need to know what beam spacing you would use. Example where will your first beam level be at? Answer:  Layout provided. 12.  Question:  What we are asking is that the specifications list that the upright should support 38/k capacity and the beams to have 5/K capacity? When we calculate the total number of beams and uprights we estimate that you will be using three pair pf beams per bay (two uprights). That each pair of beams will be evenly spaced on the upright. Hence the total capacity required is 15/K. Answer:  YES, layout provided.

The JTC TRS will be able to  connect to DMO networks to allow geographically separated high-fidelity  close air support platforms and JTACs/CCT teams to train together. The JTC  TRS will enable operators to conduct Joint Close Air Support (JCAS)  training/mission rehearsal using tailored, dynamic scenarios that are  relevant to mission tasking. Furthermore, the system will be capable of  providing air traffic control training for CCT using tactical application  of austere airbase operations. Using a system of systems approach JTC TRS  shall have the capability to network in Increment 1 to aircrew full  mission trainers and mission training centers, and by Increment 2, to Air  Support Operations Centers (ASOCs) for Joint Tactical Air Strike Requests  and air-ground coordination of Joint fires. JTC TRS will also allow  JTACS/CCT teams to use their actual equipment in the trainer. Its primary  focus is to provide a persistent total air-ground virtual training  environment for networked air ground training and mission rehearsal  capability that will develop both JTAC/CCT skills and train those air  crews assigned to accomplish complex JCAS missions in close proximity to  ground forces. JTC TRS will be fully interoperable with joint/sister  Service air ground simulation using industry standards. SEE BELOW FOR  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

<CONTACT>Margie Thorson, Contracting Officer, Phone 612-336-3209, Fax 612-370-2106, Email Margie.P.Thorson@usda.gov
<DESC>CANCELLED...The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), Plant Protection and Quarantine (PPQ) intends to acquire services for the visual survey of Asian Longhorned Beetle (ALB) host trees using tree climbers, and bucket trucks, if required, within the State of New York.  These services will cover the infestation in Manhattan, NY.  ALB bores into and kills a variety of tree species including, but not limited to, species of Elm, Maple, Birch, Willow, Box Elder, Horsechestnut, Buckeye, European Mountain Ash, Ash, Poplar, Mimosa, Hackberry, London Plane, and Sycamore.  This nonnative pest has the potential to spread to other areas of the United States and cause extensive losses to ornamental and commercial tree species.  As a consequence, the Secretary of Agriculture declared an emergency for the eradication of ALB in the areas identified.  Visual surveys using tree climbers and bucket trucks to perform the inspections are a vital component to the success of the ALB Eradication Program.  USDA is looking to accomplish two goals through these survey contracts:  1) Detect all ALB infested trees in order to eliminate the infestation as quickly as possible and 2)  Confirm eradication by accomplishing repeated negative surveys on all ALB host trees within the targeted areas.  The contiguous survey area in Manhattan, New York, is approximately 7 square miles and contains both publicly accessible and limited access trees.  The publicly accessible trees are those trees located along streets, boulevards, highways, railroad right-of-ways, wetlands, bogs, and marshes as well as those in parklands, industrial parks, wood lots, housing developments, cemeteries, etc.  Limited access trees include all host trees located in alleys, courtyards, front yards, backyards, and on terraces and rooftops, etc.  There are an estimated 7,842 publicly accessible trees (1,897 less than 8? DBH, 3,369 between 8? and 16?, and 2,576 are 17? or greater) and 7,817 limited access trees (4,409 less than 8? DBH, 1,844 between 8? and 16?, and 1,564 are 17? or greater) in the survey area.  The survey of publicly accessible trees will include both tree climbing and bucket truck services and will be in the form of a firm fixed price, completion type contract.  The inspection of limited access trees will include both tree climbing and bucket truck services and will be in the form of a time and material type contract.  The contracts are anticipated to last for 12 months beginning September 1, 2006 (or date of award) through August 31, 2007 with unilateral options up to four years to extend the effective period.  The government may elect to award a single contract or to award multiple contracts for the same services to two or more sources under this solicitation.   The solicitation will be issued on an unrestricted basis, however, award preference will be provided to companies qualified under the Small Business Administration HUB Zone and Section 8(a) programs and other small and small disadvantaged businesses.  NAIC Code:  115310, Size Standard:  $6.0 million dollar average receipts.  To be eligible for contract award, the offeror must be registered in CCR.  Register via the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov or by contacting CCR Customer Service Contact Information at 1-888-2272423.    THIS AGENCY DOES NOT ISSUE HARD COPIES OF THE SOLICITATION; YOU MUST DOWNLOAD A COPY FROM THIS WEBSITE.  THE SOLICITATION IS EXPECTED TO BE POSTED ON THIS WEBSITE ON OR ABOUT AUGUST 21, 2006.

Without the maintenance and service, the Taylor TD3100 will give inaccurate readings for vehicle engines power and torque.  DO L employees may be misled and replace equipment or make unneeded repairs, resulting in added cost to the Government.  The Taylor TD3100 Dynamometer is a costly piece of equipment, procured in August 2004 for approximately $47,500.  $4,000 in maintenance co st is a relatively small cost in comparison to original cost of the equipment.  According to an electrical contractor, a non-authorized service provider may use after-market parts, which may void the warranty of a dynamometer.  Thus to protect the original  costly inves tment, he recommended obtaining parts and service only from the original source. 7.  MARKET RESEARCH:  Taylor Dynamometer is a small business under NAICS 334519, Other Measuring and Controlling Device Manufacturing.  Although a search on CCR http://www.ccr.gov indicates many small businesses under NAICS 334519 (almost 1,800), per phone  conversation 30 August 2007 with Eric of Taylor Dynamometer, parts and service for the Taylor TD3100 Dynamometer are available only through Taylor Dynamometer and the only service location is in New Berlin, Wisconsin.  Thus, Taylor Dynamometers are propri etary, and this procurement will be solicited as sole source/brand name mandatory. 8.  EFFORTS TO OBTAIN COMPETITION:  The requirement will be synopsized on FedBizOpps for three days.  Taylor Dynamometers will be contacted for a quote.  Valid quotes will be compared for price reasonableness. 9.   ACTIONS TO INCREASE COMPETITION:  The requirement will be synopsized on FedBizOpps for three days.  Taylor Dynamometers will also be contacted for a quote.  Parts and service can be provided only from the original source (Taylor Dynamometer), so this procurement will be solicited as sole source/brand name mandatory. 10. CONTRACT SPECIALISTS CERTIFICATION:  I certify that this J&A is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief and find the justification adequate to support other than full and open competition. 	/signature on file/					DATE:  	4 Sep 07	 MARIE C.

<DESC>THIS IS A SYNOPSIS FOR A SOLE SOURCE ACQUISITION (REFERENCE FAR PART 13.106-1(b)) AS REQUIRED BY FAR PART 5.2.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION/PROPOSAL.  The Contracting Officer has determined that the circumstances of this contract action deem only one source is reasonably available.  This requirement is considered noncommercial in nature and any resultant purchase order will be awarded in accordance with FAR Part 13.   The 45th Contracting Squadron intends to award a sole source Fixed Price purchase order to Florida State University (FSU).  The purpose of the requirement is to determine optimal parameter settings for the Weather Research and Forecast Model (WRF) and Pacific Northwest National Lab (PNNL) Integrated Lagrangian Transport (PILT) model to best represent the current state of the atmosphere and the transport and dispersion (T&D) of radiological effluent when performing simulations in various regions across the globe of interest to the Air Force Technical Applications Center (AFTAC).    The WRF model was developed by various agencies and universities (e.g., the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA), the Penn State University) and is considered the United States meteorological ?community? mesoscale model.  PILT is a modified version of FLEXPART (developed at the University of Munich) that can be run using WRF output. This research and development will consist of sensitivity studies of both WRF and PILT. The anticipated period of performance is 12 months from the date of award. FSU is the only source known to be capable of fulfilling the government?s requirement. FSU has unique experience in long range transport issues, having participated in seven NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) airborne field projects involving the global transport of air pollutants.  Locations of those field projects include numerous regions within both hemispheres.  This vast experience in performing and analyzing numerical model simulations over various regions of the world is critical to accomplishment of this requirement.  This research will answer questions that are very similar to those encountered during the NASA research.  FSU prepared various T&D products for each project using a variety of meteorological model output?ranging from global models down to the locally run Mesoscale Model 5  (MM5). By viewing the trajectories and comparing them with airborne in situ data, FSU has obtained vast experience in assessing the quality of trajectories and other T&D related parameters. Other research projects have given FSU extensive experience in sensitivity studies of additional mesoscale models (e.g., the Advanced Regional Prediction System (ARPS) and the Weather Research and Forecast model (WRF)) and their applicability to transport and dispersion analyses.  FSU has extensive experience with both of the models of interest.  FSU personnel attended the latest WRF tutorial conducted by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) during Summer 2007 to learn the most recent upgrades to the WRF. Since FSU will run both the WRF and PILT models during the next NASA field project in Spring 2008, that NASA research will continue to complement and enhance this Air Force research.  Finally, the FSU personnel can consult (at no cost) with other in-house meteorology faculty who also are experts in running the WRF model.  The solicitation for this requirement will be issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).    It is advertised with a North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of 541710, with a size standard of 500.  Potential contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry to be eligible for award (See Internet site: http://www.ccr.dlsc.dla.mil)     It is mandatory to obtain a DUNS number prior to registering in CCR by calling Dun & Bradstreet (1-800-333-0505).    This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive quotations.   Any firm that believes it can meet the specifications above may give written notification to the point of contact below.    Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>NASAs Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) for meeting its upcoming requirements. These requirements encompass the scope of work supporting the Information Technology and Communication Directorate, which includes the Business Applications and Sustaining Engineering (BASE) contract.  In addition to the scope of work covered historically by the BASE contract, GSFC is also considering emerging requirements that are developing as a result of strategic Information Technology (IT) drivers both at the Center and within the Agency. GSFC spends approximately $250 million dollars annually on Information Technology of which approximately $50M is spent on Office Automation, IT Infrastructure, and Telecommunications.  There are significant challenges in IT management associated with a decentralized IT organization, lack of sufficient visibility into IT spending, immature IT governance, and information security challenges.  To meet these challenges, the Office of the GSFC Chief Information Officer (CIO) is embarking on an effort to consolidate business infrastructure and application development, telecommunications infrastructures, and desktop management.  The GSFC CIO is also a strong advocate and supporter of the complementary efforts to address the similar challenges that NASA has Agency wide.   GSFC anticipates the award of two contracts to cover current and emerging IT requirements: Goddard Unified Enterprise Services and Technology (GUEST) and Helping to Optimize Enterprise Strategies for Transformation (HOEST).

Smith Museum of Natural History, Albertson College of Idaho as the official depository of all collections. The museum curates and catalogs these specimens for long-term storage and maintains a GIS data base for the location of each collection. The museum is permitted to handle rare and endangered species by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (02US736292/9).

United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), 7701 Tampa Point Blvd, Tampa, FL 33621, requires EMC Corporation?s Document Records Management Software licenses to support their users.

V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTORS UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY)
EMC Documentum Records Manager 5.3 SP4 is a DoD 5015.2 certified software application designed to manage electronic, non-electronic, and e-mail records to include classified records.
 

EMC Documentum 5.3 Records Manager extends Documentum's existing Content Management functionality by adding features and functions specific to records management such as corporate file plans, retention policies (RPS), file- and field-level security along with the ability to manage and declare records. This solution USSOCOM' s chosen DoD compliant Electronic Records
Management application which is operated on our internal network and manages HQ USSOCOM and our components official records. In order to continue to operate this system, we are required to pay a yearly maintenance fee on our current licenses. Therefore, this acquisition will be a follow-on contract for the continued production of highly specialized equipment. EMC is the sole source provider of support services for this product. Immix Technology is authorized to provide quotes for GSA customers only, however, EMC is the sole provider.
The United States Special Operations Command believes that award to another source would result in substantial cost, delays and ultimately serious mission degradation. The numbers below shows costs required to integrate a new system into the current USSOCOM enterprise architecture. This cost estimate is based on initial licensing, license maintenance, consulting services, training and travel/T.DY costs. The cost does include other factors .like additional server licenses, lost manpower hours, data migration costs, end user training, and system down-time to the command. Additionally, it would directly affect and negatively impact other systems that are currently being fielded at USSOCOM and require this application:
Ex 1 enditure	t	Cost	Total
RM Administrator Licenses	200qty.	$250.00ea.	$50,000.00total;
RM Client Extension/Content Server/Webtop (all
include end user license)	6,469qty.	$250.00ea.	$1,617,250.00total;
Retention Policy Services	12qty.	$250.00ea.	$3,000.00total;
License Maintenance (18% of initial purchase price
include in initial purchase price also)	1qty.	18% of initial
license purchase
and yearly
thereafterea.	$300,645.00total;
			
Consulting Services	1880qty.	$250.00ea.	$470,000.00total;
Offsite IT training tuition for System Admins	9qty.	$1,500.0ea.()	$13,500.00 total;
Tra vel/TDY Cost	9qty.	$6,000.00ea.	$54,000.00total;
			
Total Cost			$2,508,395.00total;

The above estimate was compiled based on our current electronic records management system configuration and prices arc subject to change dependant upon how each vendor packages their licenses. This most certainly would result in USSOCOM having to purchase additional license types in order to field a different electronic records management system.
Accordingly, EMC Documentum is the only firm capable of providing the supplies and services described in Section 11I above without the U.S. Air Force experiencing substantial duplication of cost that could not be expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling governmental requirements. Without this service, USSOCOM will not be able to effectively manage and maintain official command records that are created in support of the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) and comply with DoD standards and Federal law.

<SUBJECT>A -- TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY Technique for Detection and Directionality Determination of Electromagnetic Sources
<DESC>TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY
Technique for Detection and Directionality Determination 
of Electromagnetic Sources 

Opportunity: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering the opportunity to partner with LLNL to develop hardware and software related to the detection and directionality determination of electromagnetic (EM) signal sources. This new, potentially portable technology is intended to identify and locate low-frequency electromagnetic noise sources in order to take off-line or quickly isolate and repair the interfering electrical/electronic equipment operating in buildings, factories and large commercial facilities. The technology will also have application relating to locating general EM signal sources having frequencies falling within the operational bandwidth of the receiver.

Background: At present, sources of interfering electrical noise in a facility must be detected using a time-consuming trial-and-error approach. It is expensive because resolving such problems is often performed by independent electrical noise consultants contracted on a daily basis. Current techniques for detecting and determining the direction of EM signal sources generally involve the use of large and unwieldy directional antennas having diameters of many meters or the use of antenna arrays. In practice, the large size of a directional antenna renders impractical obtaining the source direction from  very low-frequency signals (hertz to kilohertz range) such as the electrical noise harmonics that commonly emanate from the power supplies of electronic systems. 

In addition, common antennas and receivers for detecting EM signals are usually designed only to capture the electric-field component of the signal. Since electromagnetic waves are characterized by both electric and magnetic field potentially significant information is lost.

Description:   The LLNL approach uses both the electric and magnetic components of an electromagnetic wave, which provides information about the direction of wave emanation as well as the flux of energy in the wave. 

Advantages:  
?X	Directionality can be readily determined
?X	Potentially highly portable
?X	Diagnostic tool rather than trial and error method
?X	Locate lower frequency (e.g., power-line frequency and associated harmonics) electrical interference noise sources in complex electrical/electronic environments. 
?X	Locate non-noise sources that have frequency components falling within the operational bandwidth of the receiver. 


Potential Applications: 
Electrical noise detection and elimination as well as non-noise signal location has commercial, law enforcement and military applications.
Specifically, the features and benefits to the applications are listed below. 

Feature	Benefit
Measure both the electric and magnetic fields of an electromagnetic wave	?	Antenna size comparable to wavelength of signal being acquired is not required  
?	Makes possible low frequency noise directionality applications and portability
Separate and identify different frequency sources through signal analysis 	?	Directions of slightly different signals that even overlap in frequency can be isolated from each other
Antennas are omni-directional	?	All signals in a given frequency range are captured 
?	Intermittent noise or signals of interest will not be missed as for directional antennas pointed in the wrong direction
?	Moving sources can be tracked without re-orienting receiver.
Directionality obtained entirely through analysis of acquired signal and not by a hands-on re-orienting of antenna during signal acquisition	?	Signal direction can be obtained either in real time or by postprocessing of saved digital signal data. 
?	Data can be acquired passively and in remote environments without human involvement

Development Status: 
	Initial field testing has identified noise signals from a power generator and load. providing directional information about the noise source. These tests have made apparent the advantages of measuring both the electric and magnetic fields of a signal. Further development is needed to scale down the electric- and magnetic-field antennas, the receiver and the processing hardware to a convenient level of portability (e.g., handheld). 

The analysis technique has been developed through subsequent detailed computer simulations of noise and signal sources, but is still in development and can benefit from signal processing and optimization development.

LLNL is seeking industry partners with a demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market. Moving critical technology beyond the Laboratory to the commercial world helps our licensees gain a competitive edge in the marketplace. All licensing activities are conducted under policies relating to the strict nondisclosure of company proprietary information.  

Please visit the IPAC website at http://www.llnl.gov/IPandC/workwithus/partneringprocess.php

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's Technique for Detection and Directionality Determination of Electromagnetic Sources should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.	Company Name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.

<SUBJECT>A -- Proposer's Day Announcement, BAA 07-64, Hyperadsorptive Atmospheric Sampling Technology (HAST)
<DESC>PROPOSER'S DAY CONFERENCE
DARPA will host a Proposer's Day Workshop in support of the anticipated Hyperadsorptive Atmospheric Sampling Technology (HAST) BAA on September 20, 2007 at Schafer Corp, 3811 N. Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203 from 8:30 - 16:00.  The purpose of this conference is to provide information on the HAST program; promote additional discussion on atmospheric sampling; address questions from potential proposers; and provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities for teaming opportunities.   

PROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND DESCRIPTION:  The objective of the HAST program is to develop systems  that permit exhaustive, accurate, and economical collection of atmospheric trace constituents to support chemical mapping of urban and military environments.  The system, which integrates three technical components, will demonstrate materials, packaging, and extraction technologies that sample atmospheric impurities whose concentration ranges from 10 parts per trillion to 100 parts per million by volume from 100 liter-atmospheres of gas in less than five minutes.  In the second phase, a complete system that weighs less than one kilogram including power, indexing for one hundred samples, and GPS geolocation will be demonstrated.

A website, www.schafertmd.com/HAST, has been established to facilitate the formation of teams that may choose to respond to the HAST BAA.  Networking and team formation are the responsibility of the participants and are not controlled by DARPA.  Documents uploaded onto this site can be viewed and downloaded by all registered site users.  Only documents marked with 'unlimited distribution' statements will be accepted for posting on this site.  The contents of the site are the responsibility of the poster.  Neither DARPA nor the Department of Defense (DoD) endorses information posted by outside individuals or organizations, nor does DARPA or the DoD exercise any responsibility for those contents.  Attendees may submit no more than 4 powerpoint slides in advance for distribution at the Proposer's Day Workshop.  Again, only documents marked with 'unlimited distribution' statements will be accepted for posting on this site.

REGISTRATION INFORMATION:  Participants must register no later than 17:00 EST on September 17, 2007, at the following website: www.schafertmd.com/HAST.  Directions to the facility and other materials are also available on the website.  There is no registration fee for attending this conference.  

Attendance will be limited to the first 50 registrants, with no more than 2 representatives per organization due to space limitations in the conference facility.  The Proposer's Day will be unclassified and open to the general public.  All attendees will be required to present government issued photo identification upon entry to the event.  Additionally, all US Citizens are required to submit a US Citizenship Verification form in order to attend this conference.  Non-US citizens are required to submit a DARPA Form 60 "Foreign National Visit Request."  The completed Citizenship Form or DARPA Form 60 must be faxed to: Ms. Beverly Sobel, Schafer Corp., fax 703-807-4971 (phone 703-248-1528) no later than September 17, 2007.

<DESC>In accordance with FAR Part 13, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Library of Medicine (NLM) intends to procure consumer health information survey services  on a sole source basis from Manhattan Research LLC.  The NAICS code is 541990 and the period of performance shall be for a period of one year from September 25, 2007 to September 24, 2008.  

	NLM intends to renew the Cybercitizen Health national consumer health information survey service.  NLM determined that Manhattan Research LLC is uniquely qualified as the sole offeror of Cybercitizen Health.  The Cybercitizen Health service offers a nationwide in-depth randomized health consumer survey through extended telephone interviews focusing on online health information users.  Further, NLM desires to compare the results of Cybercitizen Health 2007 with the prior results of Cybercitizen Health 2006, 2005, 2004, 2003, 2002, 2001, and 2000.  Additionally, NLM wishes to obtain comparable data on physician perspectives on health information, and therefore intends to again augment CybercitizenHealth with the Taking the Pulse 2007 physician health information survey service, also offered by Manhattan Research LLC, and to compare with the prior results of Taking the Pulse 2006.  It is essential that both services, focusing on the consumer and physician respectively, use the same survey methodology, in order to assure comparability and continuity

BACKGROUND INFORMATION:

The Internet and World Wide Web (WWW or web) now play a dominant role in dissemination of NLM information services.  And the web environment in which NLM operates is rapidly changing and intensely competitive.  These two factors combined suggested the need for a more comprehensive and dynamic NLM web planning and evaluation process.  Accordingly, the NLM Director, Dr. Donald A.B. Lindberg, and the NLM Associate Director for Health Information Programs Development, Dr. Elliot R. Siegel, have approved an ongoing Web Evaluation Project.  The immediate priorities of the Web Evaluation Project include: a) quantitative and qualitative metrics of web usage; b) measures of customer perception and use of NLM web sites; and c) monitoring of the quality of Internet connections by which users access NLM information services.  The Web Evaluation Project is pursuing an integrated approach intended to encourage exchange of information and learning within NLM, and help better inform NLM management decisionmaking on web site research, development, and implementation.  The Web Evaluation Project has reviewed and discussed a range of internal and external activities, including the proposed work that is the focus of this contract renewal request.

All responsible and responsive offerors will be considered for award. The NAICS Code is 423490.  (iv) This requirement is for the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN), an association of Veterinary Diagnostic labs which have been authorized by the USDA APHIS Veterinary Services to perform certain diagnostic tests for VS surveillance programs and in the event of a disease outbreak.       
(v) This combined synopsis/solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  (vi) The provisions and clauses incorporated into this solicitation document are those in effect at the time of publication.  Provisions and clauses incorporated by reference have the same force and effect as if they were given in full text.  The full text of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) can be accessed on the Internet at http://www.arnet.gov/far/ (vii) REQUIREMENT AND QUANTITIES: This requirement consists of three line items:  
CLIN 01  - Three (3) Magnetic Particle Processors for 96-well plate DNA/RNA Extraction and the complete equipment components for each piece of equipment to perform the processes described below in section (x) CLIN 02 ? Shipping of the equipment to the FOB destination.  CLIN 03 ? Installation and start up the equipment as well as training the staff on the use of the equipment. This equipment will be distributed to multiple laboratory locations in the United States.  The actual locations will be determined at a later date. Actual travel costs, if any that are charged to the government under CLIN 03 will be reimbursed at the rates provided in the Federal Travel or Joint Federal Travel Regulations and travel must be in accordance with Federal Government Travel Regulations.  (viii)  The selected contractor must be able to deliver all requested equipment within sixty (60) days from receipt of the award document.  Deliverables and acceptance of deliverables for the three particle processors will be FOB destination USDA, NVSL, 1800 Dayton Avenue in Ames, IA  50010. (ix) The PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE for this contract is from date of award through delivery of all the equipment. (x) OBJECTIVES: The diagnostic tests performed by the NAHLN have been validated for specific pieces of laboratory equipment and sets of diagnostic reagents.  The NAHLN laboratories are expected to only perform the diagnostic tests according to the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) that outline the type of equipment and reagents to use.  The current goal of the NAHLN is to increase diagnostic testing capacity and capability for Foreign Animal Diseases (FADs) to enhance veterinary diagnostic preparedness in the event of a FAD outbreak in domestic livestock or poultry.  With the elevated national concern and apprehension of the introduction of highly pathogenic Avian Influenza into the United States, the NAHLN has been directed by the USDA to double the current diagnostic testing capacity for the real time RT-PCR (real time Reverse-Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction) assay.  The NAHLN will accomplish this goal by providing laboratory equipment to approved NAHLN laboratories that increase the platform for the real time RT-PCR assay from single wells to 96 well plates.  One specific piece of necessary equipment is a magnetic particle processor capable of automatically performing the sample preparation steps of DNA/RNA (Ribonucleic Acid) extraction in the 96 well plate format. This statement of work is to define a semi-automated system for performing the 96 well plate platform viral RNA extraction method on the Avian Influenza real time RT-PCR assay.  Although this process can be accomplished manually, it is more efficient for the laboratory performing this assay if a piece of laboratory equipment performs the steps of this extraction process.  (xi) TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:  Each magnetic particle processor must meet the following technical specifications in order to be technically acceptable. 
?	Because the approved extraction kit for the 96 well plate uses the Ambion? MagMAX? paramagnetic beads, the selected equipment must be a magnetic particle processor.
?	Must be able to process Ambion? MagMAX? paramagnetic beads included in the AI/ND Viral RNA Isolation Kit
?	Must be able to utilize a 96-well microplate for PCR applications
?	Must allow processing through a minimum of 5 reagents (lysis, purification, elution, etc.)
?	Must allow software programming functionality for multiple protocols and multiple processing steps in each protocol including: incubation, capture / collection of paramagnetic beads, washing with rinse solution, elution of purified material from magnetic beads, and transfer of purified material into 96-well PCR amplification plate.
?	Must be able to shake/agitate contents of each well during incubation 
?	Software must be compatible with Microsoft XP operating system
?	Must achieve at least 90% collection recovery of the magnetic particles in each well at each process step
?	Must not allow carry over of reagents from plate to plate or cross contamination of beads from well to well.
?	Must be able to process one plate of 96 samples through the complete procedure in 30 - 45 minutes. 
?	Must have a 1 year warranty for all parts, labor, travel and include installation, start up training, and support for validated applications.  The contractor must include in their services, travel to the sites to install and start up the equipment and train the staff on the use of the equipment. 
?	The magnetic particle processor must be able to manipulate multiple 96 well plates filled with different reagent solutions so that the paramagnetic beads (with viral RNA bound to them) can be lifted from one reagent plate to another.  There can be no mixing of materials (reagents or beads) from one well to another on the same plate.  This is typically accomplished with a magnetic particle processor head that contains 96 magnetic rods.   Therefore a separate magnetic rod will contact each separate well on the 96 well plate.
In addition to the technical specifications described above, the magnetic particle processor must be able to perform the following protocols are listed here: (a) insert a protective covering over each of the magnetic rods i.e. plastic tip cover; (b) allow for the 96 well initial sample plate to be loaded into the equipment; (c) allow a 4 minute incubation and gentle mixing cycle for the initial sample plate with lysis buffer, magnetic beads, and diagnostic samples to allow viral RNA binding ? total well volume of 171ul; (d) collect the beads from each well from the initial viral RNA binding step and allow 2 minutes for capture;  (e) transfer and release the beads into to a plate with the wash solution I and allow to incubate and gently mix for 30 seconds ? total well volume of 100ul; (f) collect the beads from each well from the wash solution I step and allow 1 minute for capture;            (g) transfer and release the beads into a plate with wash solution II and allow to incubate and gently mix for 30 seconds ? total well volume of 100ul; (h) collect the beads from each well from the wash solution II step and allow 1 minute for capture; (i) transfer and release the beads into a second plate with wash solution II and allow to incubate and gently mix for 30 seconds ? total well volume of 100ul; (j) collect the beads from each well from the second wash solution II step and allow 1 minute for capture; (k) allow the beads to dry for 2-5 minutes by shaking in open air; (l) transfer and release the beads into a final plate with the elution buffer solution and allow to incubate with gentle mixing for 4 minutes ? total well volume of 50ul; (m) collect the beads from each well from the final elution step and allow 2 minutes for capture; (n) discard the beads and protective magnetic rod coverings into a separate container.  (xii) The provision at 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors - Commercial applies to this solicitation.  (xiii) The provision at 52.212-2  Evaluation - Commercial Items applies to this solicitation.  Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to this combined synopsis/solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. A trade off process will be used to evaluate quotes. The Government intends to evaluate offers and award without discussion, however, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions later if determined necessary by the Contracting Officer.

Brand name justification:

A.  The 66th Military Intelligence Group's (MIG's) European Advanced Geospatial Intelligence (AGI) Node (EARN) is the primary producer of AGI for the European Command (EUCOM). The EARN is responsible for the timely processing, exploitation, and dissemination of AGI to the EUCOM customer-set in a standard, usable, and accurate manner.  To ensure that EARN products meet the high-quality expectations of intelligence consumers, the EARN requires software packages with the proper licensing and maintenance agreements.  The Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) community de-facto standard for GEOINT analysis is the Environmental Science Research Institute's (ESRI's) ArcGIS package.

The 66th MIG EARN currently uses ArcGIS as part of its current Architecture.  At current the 66th EARN has two licensed copies of ArcGIS to be shared amongst 19 workstations.  Adding copies of ArcGIS that match the existing architecture, will increase productivity and ensure that AGI products from the EARN meet and/or exceed the growing community requirement for spatially enabled data.  The extensions of the ArcGIS package will enhance the analytical toolset available to EARN analysts, making more advanced spatial, geostatistical, 3-D, and temporal analysis possible.  It is essential that the EARN acquire the latest version of ArcGIS as soon as possible in order to support on-going and future operations.

B.  All 66th EARN analysts are currently trained in the use of this software.

C.  Current and historical data will be accessible.

D.  The solution is cost effective for the Government?s utilization of existing software.

E.  The purchase of specific brand-name products enables HQ 66th MI Group MASINT Section to simplify support, maintain the historical data and meet the operational requirements of the Defense Intelligence Community.

6.  FedBizOpps Announcement/Potential Sources

The synopsis will be combined with the solicitation in accordance with FAR part 12.  All responsive offerors will be considered.

7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price
The Contracting Officer will compete the requirement with resellers of  ESRI ARC licenses to ensure prices are fair and reasonable.

8.  Description of Market Research 

The requiring activity found multiple resellers of ESRI ARC Licenses.  The market research included the review of product information on the web, review of GSA prices on GSA Advantage, and retail pricing. 

9.  Supporting Facts

This brand name software is requested to support mandatory programs, maintain uniformity, common troubleshooting and maintenance techniques, a standardized training program and economy of resources across the Measurement And Signals INTelligence (MASINT) mission requirements.

10.  Listing of Interested sources: 

It is anticipated that resellers/wholesalers of these products will express an interest to include the following resellers:

Geographic Information Services, Inc.
E-Mediaplus, Inc.
Penobscot Bay Media LLC

11.  Actions taken to remove barriers to competition:

                       entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if 
                       the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, 
                       or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from  
                       incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

                       (b) Definitions.  As used in this clause: 

                      Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the

                      that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ?more than 50 percent? for

                      Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of

                      Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an 
                      inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)? 
    
                      (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the 
                      properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the 
                      properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    
                      (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
                      is held? 
    
(i)	In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former  
  shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic   
  corporation; or
    
                      (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former 
                      partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in 
                      the domestic partnership; and 
    
                      (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not

                      (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    
                      (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when  
                      determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted  
                      domestic corporation. 
    
                      (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as 
                      an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining  
                      ownership: 
     
                      (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
                      incorporated entity; or 
    
                      (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition  
                      described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 
                      107?296. 
    
                      (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or     
                      indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership  
                      during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this  
                      Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, 
                      Such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    
                      (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by 
                       contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a 
                       principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    
                      (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of   
                      Public Law 107?296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in 
                      regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the  
                      meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a  
                      partnership. 
    
                      (e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
 
                      (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present 
                      value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
 
                      (i) Warrants; 
                      (ii) Options; 
                      (iii) Contracts to acquire stock;

                      (v) Others similar interests. 
    
                      (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed  
                      appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard  
                      transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835. 
    
          (f) Disclosure. The offeror under this solicitation represents that {Check one}:

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, and independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity.

(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held. (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic  corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in
the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs. (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining  ownership: (i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign  incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition
described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1). (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) warrants; (ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; (iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.   It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.           Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d) (2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-9131), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation number is NIH-NIDDK-07-481 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-18.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 112990 and the business size standard is $0.75M.  This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  However, this solicitation is not set aside for small business.  It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH); National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) to procure mouse breeding services from Taconic Farms, 273 Hover Avenue, Germantown, NY 12526.  These services are for a BASE year with two (2) option years.

The Molecular Signaling Section at The Laboratory of Bioorganic Chemistry (LBC), NIDDK has generated mutant mouse strains lacking M1-M5 muscarinic receptors (Mi-M5 single KO mice) as well as several muscarinic receptor double KO mice (M2/M4 KO; M2/M3 KO; M1/M4 KO). Since 2003, Taconic Farm has been breeding and maintaining small colonies (5 breeding cages each) of the above mouse lines (including control strains).  The mouse strains described above only exist at Taconic.   Taconic Farms service also includes the shipping of the mice to our more than 50 collaborators.  This is a continuation of service and these mice and strains are an excellent source for animals needed for experiments that have been ongoing in the LBC. The LBC has been utilizing the mice and mice strains mentioned above from Taconic Farms and must maintain consistency with the animals still on study that were previously obtained from Taconic Farms.  Changing variables at this time would prevent correct interpretation of experiment in progress. Analysis of these animals should clarify the physiological and pathophysiological roles that the individual muscarinic receptors play in vivo.  Given the potential role of these receptor subtypes in human disease including diabetes and obesity, these mouse lines are of great potential therapeutic relevance.  

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations however; all responses received within 15 days from the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition is based upon responses to this notice and is solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive acquisition.

Each reference must represent equipment that is currently being used within the past three (3) years.  Include the name, address, telephone number and point of contact of the firm or agency.  In accordance with FAR 15.305(a)(2), offerors with no relevant performance history will receive a neutral rating.  REQUIRED REGISTRATION WITH CONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE SYSTEM (CPS) (a) As prescribed in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 42.15, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) evaluates contractor past performance on all contracts that exceed $100,000, and shares those evaluations with other Federal Government contract specialists and procurement officials.  The FAR requires that the contractor be provided an opportunity to comment on past performance evaluations prior to each report closing.  To fulfill this requirement VA uses an online database, the Contractor Performance System (CPS), which is maintained by the National Institutes of Health (NIH).  The CPS database information is shared with the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) database, which is available to all Federal agencies. (b) Each contractor whose contract award is estimated to exceed $100,000 is required to register with the NIH CPS database at the following web address: https://cpscontractor.nih.gov.  Help in registering can be obtained by contacting CPS Support E-mail (cps-support-l@list.nih.gov) or by calling (301) 451-2771. Registration should occur no later than thirty days after contract award, and must be kept current should there be any change to the contractor's registered representative.  (c) For contracts with a period of one year or less, the contracting officer will perform a single evaluation when the contract is complete.  For contracts exceeding one year, the contracting officer will evaluate the contractor's performance annually.  Interim reports will be filed each year until the last year of the contract, when the final report will be completed.  The report shall be assigned in CPS to the contractor's designated representative for comment.  The contractor representative will have thirty days to submit any comments and re-assign the report to the VA contracting officer.  (d) Failure to have a current registration with the NIH CPS database, or to re-assign the report to the VA contracting officer within those thirty days, will result in the Government's evaluation being placed on file in the database with a statement that the contractor failed to respond; (f) Price.  Technical capabilities, human factors, anticipated reliability and serviceability, the extent of training offered and past performance when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price. (x)  The provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certification, Commercial Items, applies to this solicitation.  The contractor shall either: (1) return a completed copy of this provision with its quote (a copy of the provision may be attained from http://www.arnet.gov/far); or (2) complete the Online Reps and Certs.

APPENDIX A  VEHICLE CLAIMS INSTRUCTIONS These instructions tell you how to file a claim for loss or damage to your vehicle or its accessories that occurred during a Government sponsored shipment. Please read these instructions carefully to understand what you must do.  1. Recommendation.  The Government recommends that you first attempt to settle your claim directly with the contractor who shipped your vehicle. However, the amount paid by the contractor is not based on a binding estimate from a repair company. While the contractor will att empt to accurately estimate the cost of repairing an item, the actual cost of the repair may exceed what the contractor paid for that item. If you have accepted payment from the contractor on an item, you may not claim any additional amount for that item f rom the military claims office. If you do not feel that the offer made by the contractor is a good settlement, you may file your claim with a military claims office.  2. Joint inspections.  a. When you drop off or pickup your vehicle, you will be required to conduct a joint inspection with the contractor to determine the condition of your vehicle. This is important because regardless of where you file your claim, you must prove that the loss and/or damage being claimed occurred while the vehicle was shipped or stored.  b. During the joint inspection carefully and completely list any loss and/or damage to your vehicle on the DD Form 788 or other inspection form. You should receive one copy of the inspection form at the initial turn-in inspection and a second copy of the i nspection form at destination when you pick up your vehicle. List all loss and damage in item #13, column 1 of the DD Form 788. The contractor's inspector will record his agreement or disagreement in item #13, column 2.  c. Do not rely on a representative of the company that shipped your vehicle to list loss and/or damage for you. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE LISTED ALL LOSSES OR DAMAGE TO YOUR VEHICLE BEFORE YOU LEAVE THE VPC.  d. Inspect the interior, exterior, and all systems of your vehicle very closely. It will be difficult to prove that damage you discover after accepting your vehicle occurred during shipment/storage and not while the vehicle was in your possession. However,  if you discover damage after you have left the vehicle processing center, YOU MUST IMMEDIATELY NOTIFY THE COMPANY THAT SHIPPED YOUR VEHICLE, IN WRITING and, when possible, obtain an additional inspection at the VPC. When impractical to return to the VPC f or another additional joint inspection, immediately seek a joint inspection at the nearest military claims office. Be sure to give a detailed description of the damage and explain why it was not discovered at the joint inspection when you picked up your ve hicle. Keep a copy of the notice for your claim. Notice of additional loss and/or damage must be reported to the contractor immediately. Do not wait until you can get another inspection to notify the contractor.  3. FILING CLAIMS WITH THE CONTRACTOR.  a. Fill out the claim form provided by the contractor. If you are still at the contractor's vehicle processing center, give the claim to the contractors representative and retain one copy for your records. If you have left the vehicle processing center, ma il the claim form to the address provided by the contractor. The contractor will review your claim and tell you within sixty (60) calendar days how much it will pay. If you discover additional loss and/or damage,  after you submitted your claim but before the contractor has paid the claim, you should immediately notify the contractor and amend your claim.  b. If both you and the contractor agree while you are still at the vehicle processing center that your claim can be settled for $1000 or less, you may elect the on site settlement option. The contractor will pay you the amount of your claim immediately at the vehicle processing center. While your acceptance of such a settlement is final with respect to the claimed damage, you may still file a claim for any additional damage discovered and reported within a reasonable period of time after leaving the port. N OTE: THE VPC IS NOT A REPAIR FACILITY AND THE ON SITE SETTLEMENT may not be enough to pay the cost of actual repairs. The on site settlement should be considered only has a cash compensation for Damage. The award is not guaranteed to cover your repair cost s. If you accept payment at the VPC for damage to a part of your vehicle, you will not be paid any additional amount for that damage from a military claims office.  c. The contractor must settle you claim within sixty (60) days to your satisfaction. If you have elected to file your claim with the contractor but have not received an offer within 60 days or do not want to accept the contractors offer, you may file your  claim with the appropriate military claims office. If you have any questions regarding the settlement being offered by the contractor, please contact the appropriate military claims office for guidance. NOTE: You may also file a claim with the military cl aims office directly, without first filing a claim with the contractor.  d. If you discover additional damage or more extensive damage, after the contractor has paid your claim, you can ask the contractor to consider an amended claim. However, the contractor will generally not be required to reopen a claim after it has been pai d. Therefore, it is critical that you do a complete and thorough inspection of the inside and outside of your vehicle and all of its controls and accessories. Do not be rushed in making the inspection. Make sure you check everything and put any damage or l oss on the inspection sheet BEFORE YOU LEAVE THE VEHICLE PROCESSING CENTER.  e. You have two years from pick-up date to file your claim with the contractor who shipped your vehicle, BUT YOU SHOULD FILE YOUR CLAIM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, PREFERABLY WITHIN 60 DAYS OF DELIVERY. Because you only have two years from date of pick-up to file  a claim with the military claims office, if you wait two years to file a claim with the contractor, you will probably not have time to file a claim with the Government if you are not satisfied with the carrier's offer.  4. FILING CLAIMS WITH A MILITARY CLAIMS OFFICE.  a. If you elect to file a claim with the Government, call or visit the claims office at your installation or the nearest military installation. The claims personnel at the military claims office will give you the necessary claim forms and instructions.  b. You must prove that you own the vehicle, that the loss and/or damage you are claiming occurred during the Government-sponsored shipment and the cost of any repairs or replacement. Claims personnel can answer any questions, especially about estimates of repair. Any estimates of repair or paid repair bills for damage to operating systems such as transmission, electrical system, or engine should include a professional opinion as to the cause of the damage. Estimate of repair or paid repair bills must identi fy what was repaired or replaced For example, a repair bill for a broken tail light and a broken windshield should show the cost of both items separately and have two entries, one showing the time to fix the tail light and one showing the time to fix the w indshield.  c. If you have private vehicle insurance that covered the vehicle while it was being shipped, you MUST file and settle a claim with your insurance company prior to filin g a claim with the Government. You will be required to state on your Government claim form whether or not you have insurance on your vehicle that was in effect during the shipment/storage period. All insurance settlement documents must be submitted with yo ur government claim.  d. If you file a claim with the Government, you are required to notify the claims office where you filed the claim of any offer of settlement or denial of liability by any third party, such as the contractor who shipped the vehicle or your private insurer. e. While you have two years from the time you picked up your POV to file a claim with the Government, YOU SHOULD FILE YOUR CLAIM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, PREFERABLY WITHIN 60 DAYS OF PICK UP . Early filing assists the military claims office to resolve any ques tions about your claim that could delay payment.

This requirement is being issued to enhance existing hardware.  It is needed in support of MDAs mission: Develop and field an integrated BMDS capable of providing a layered defense for the homeland, deployed forces, friends, and allies against ballistic missiles of all ranges in all phases of flight.  The Missile Defense Agencys mission is to develop, test, and prepare for deployment a missile defense system. Using complementary interceptors, land, sea, and air space based sensors, and battle management command and control systems, the planned missile defense system will be able to engage all classes and ranges of ballistic missile threats.  Our programmatic strategy is to develop, rigorously test, and continuously evaluate production, deployment and operational alternatives for the ballistic missile defense system.  Missile defense systems being developed and tested by MDA are primarily based on hit-to-kill technology.  IT has been described as hitting a bullet with a bullet  a capability that has been successfully demonstrated in test after test.  No other software exists that affords the capability.  Hitachi hardware has been adopted by MDAs program and this interface is the only one that will work with this existing hardware architecture.  Any other type of support will add extra costs of an additional hardware interface. There is only one responsible hardware product and no other support will satisfy the agencys requirements because of equipment requirements. Failure to provide this single type of hardware support will have a significant adverse effect on the programs mission.<BR><BR>

These CLINs are Brand Name or Equal CLINs and all products must be manufactured exactly to OEM specification in terms of fit, finish, size, shape, weight, performance, and durability. In addition to meeting OEM specifications as above, all offerors must certify in their proposal that weapons proposed meet the following minimum specifications: i) M2HBs shall be in the âflexibleâ configuration. ii) M2HBs shall be equipped with a trigger block safety iii) M2HBs shall be equipped with a fixed headspace and timing iv) M2HBs shall be configured to use and barrels shall be configured and installed as Quick Change Barrels (QCBs) on delivery.

Proposing use of used or reconditioned parts will result in your offer being eliminated from award consideration. Technical literature, warranty details, and delivery schedule must be submitted for all products offered for the Government to perform a technical evaluation. No further request will be made to obtain required information and failure to submit may result in your offer being eliminated from award consideration. Award will be made relative to best overall value.  Best value will be determined in accordance with FAR Clause 52.212-2, below.  Offers must meet all minimum specifications, but offers which exceed minimums may be rated more favorably.  The Government will not, however, pay an unreasonable amount for additional technical capability and will compare any additional capability to any additional price.  Since the Government is interested in obtaining the best overall value, award may not go to the lowest overall price if any factors considered justify a higher price.  Notwithstanding that technical capability is more important than price, should all offers appear equal, price will become the determining factor in the award decision. The following provisions and clauses apply to this procurement: FAR 52.204-7, Central Contractor Registration; FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-2, EvaluationâCommercial Items; (Jan 1999) (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (in relative order of importance) (i) technical capability of the item offered to meet the Government requirement; (ii) delivery schedule; (iii) price; (iv) warranty; and (v) past performance. All other evaluation factors, when combined, are significantly more important than price.  (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).  (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offerâs specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<DESC>Answers to Questions
Technical Assistance on Spanish Language Resources on Reading for Families
National Institute for Literacy
RFP # ED-07-R-0096

Q.1.  Tasks 3 and 5 require both Spanish and English versions of planning documents. However, for these tasks, in contrast to Task 6 (where it is clearly necessary to produce both language versions), it appears that the work can proceed based on an English language document only and the development of the parallel documents in both Spanish and English will consume additional level of effort and cost. It is necessary to include both Spanish and English documents for Tasks 3 and 5?

A.1.  The Institute feels strongly that the Spanish language documents should be developed organically and not as translations of English language documents, as noted in the Purpose of Acquisition section of the Statement of Work.   If an offeror believes it is able to produce the quality of publication the Institute is seeking without completing all elements of the tasks in the SOW, the offeror's proposal should explain how the alternate approach can still accomplish the Institute's goals.

Q.2.  What length of document is NIFL considering for each of the two publications as described in Tasks 6 and 8?

A.2.  The offer should propose lengths that are appropriate for the information to be conveyed and for the parents expected to receive the publications (see Q.3 below)

Q.3.  What level of parent reading skill is NIFL intending to target?

A.3.  The Institute welcomes offerors' recommendations concerning parent skill levels.

Q.4.  Should the optional tasks be included in the narrative proposal and should separate budgets provided for each? If included in the narrative, the page limit is very small for including this amount of content.  Please provide guidance on how NIFL would like to have the optional tasks included in the proposal.

A.4.  Optional Tasks may be addressed in a supplemental narrative that should not exceed 5 double-spaced pages.

Q.5.  Is there an incumbent contractor currently providing these services? If yes, who is it?

A.5.  No, there is not an incumbent contractor.

Q.6.  If available, can we please get a list of interested companies?

A.6.	The Institute does not provide a list of interested parties.  However, the Interested Vendor List feature is available in FedBizOpps.  To date, at least 2 firms have registered as vendors interested in this solicitation.  See the list at http://www.fbo.gov/spg/ED/NIFL/EO/ED-07-R-0096/ivlspg.html.

BEPT Questions and Answers 7 September 2007

 
1.  Please clarify what the proposal response should consist of (there is no mention of a cost proposal vs.narrative/technical proposal and what these each - if required - should include.)

Answer:  Proposal response should consist of narrative, technical and total cost proposal based on the items identified in the SOW (Scope, Specification, Contractor Task, Report and Deliveries, Delivery Schedule Review and Test).  

 
2.  What are the basis / criteria for the selection?

3.  What format should the proposal be in; i.e., SF 330 or some other format? 

Answer: MS WORD and/or .pdf, use the format of your choice.


3.  What specifically should I be submitting as part of the proposal - price only, technical qualifications only, or both? 

Answer: Proposal response should consist of narrative, technical and total cost proposal based on the items identified in the SOW (Scope, Specification, Contractor Task, Report and Deliveries, Delivery Schedule Review and Test). 


4. If technical qualifications are required, what needs to be submitted - past performance, resumes, firm profile, etc.? 

Answer: past performance (working with ACES-RP, ACES-PM, Content Management System, web development, Oracle 10GR2, ArcIMS, ArcSDE, ArcGIS)


5.  Should the price proposal be packaged separately from the technical proposal?

8.  Can I hand deliver the proposal?  Can I fax the proposal?

Answer: email (preferred), hand deliver, or fax, 


9.  Do I need to actually submit my Representations and Certifications or is a statement that they are up-to-date at ORACLE sufficient? 

Answer: A statement is sufficient (Contractor need to be up-to-date in ORACLE 10GR2, working with ACES-PM and ACES-RP).  


10.  Why the short turn-around on submitting a proposal?

The following are QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS concerning this requirement:
HMMWV EGRESS ASSISTANCE TRAINER (HEAT) QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
as of 7 Sep 07

1. Q. In the original Combined Solicitation, CLIN 0001 indicates "customer-provided" up-armored cabs, yet the next sentence indicates "Armored cab shall be provided by the Government..." It is not clear whether the contractor is being asked to fabricate the cabs or simply install cabs that are provided by the Government.  Please clearly indicate the responsibility of the customer and the Government.  

A. The contractor is not responsible for the fabrication of the cabs.  ?Government? and ?customer? are the same.  The cabs shall be provided to the contractor by the Government.
 

2. Q.  In the original Combined Solicitation, CLIN 0001, there is a listing of specifications. This further complicates the determination of the contractor's responsibilities. Is the Government requesting that two additional trainers be fabricated or that two Government-owned existing HEAT trainers be modified with armored cabs?  

A.  The specifications in CLIN 0001 have been revised as of 7 Sep 07.  The two trainers shall be fabricated using the Government provided cabs.
 

3. Q.  HEAT trainers are fielded and come in several varieties. Some have catwalks and others do not. In the event that two new trainers are to be fabricated, will the government provide drawings, parts lists, sources of supply, schematics, and any other form of technical data available on existing trainers as well as a description of the particular trainer to be modeled? 

A.  No, it is determined that this product is currently being manufactured by industry.  Please submit quotes in response to the revised combined synopsis/solicitation.  The CLIN structure that is provided in the combined synopsis/solicitation is encouraged for quote format, but vendors may modify the structure as needed.  Please assure that you review the latest revisions to the combined synopsis/solicitation as of 7 Sep 07.
 
4. Q.  The Specifications indicated in the original Combined Solicitation include some components that may have multiple uses. Please indicate the purpose of each specification and where in the trainer that specification is to apply.

A.  Please clarify which components are causing confusion.  Also, please review the revised specifications as of 7 Sep 07.
 

5. Q. CLIN 0002 indicates disassembly.  Is this disassembly of a stand-alone HMMWV cab or is an entire HMMWV provided for cannibalization? In the latter, what is the disposition of the remaining HMMWV assembly? Will the Government provide shipping to the contractor of the initial configuration?

A.  The entire HMMWV will be provided for cannibalization.  Disposition of remaining HMMWV parts will be the responsibility of the company.  Government will provide shipping of HMMWV to company (see CLIN 0006).
 
6.  Q.  Mounting is indicated in fixed or mobile applications. Are the hard-points the same? In the case of mobile mounting, is it possible to locate the mobile mount at the contractor facility?

A.  Mounting shall be fixed (see revised specifications as of 7 Sep 07).  Hard points will be determined by the company producing the HEAT, unless specified prior to construction of HEAT (Air Force customer may already have specifications for hard points based on existing concrete pad)

 
7. Q.  Training is indicated in CLIN 0004. Will the Government specify training objectives and tasks in more detail?

A.  Training will consist of a minimum 8 hour ?train-the-trainer? session located at the delivery location of the HEAT trainer.  All aspects of training, i.e. hand-outs, videos, computer equipment, will be provided by the company producing the HEAT trainer.  User will be trained on all aspects of operations and safety of HEAT equipment.  Please see the latest revisions to the specifications as of 7 Sep 07.

A  biometric TWIC card will be required to be used by anyone needing unescorted access to secure areas of MTSA (Section 6.6) regulated vessels or facilities as well as by all USCG credentialed Merchant Mariners.  Those workers identified as needing a TWIC will be required to enroll in the program by providing certain biographic data, submitting to biometric fingerprint collection and a digital facial picture upon enrollment. TSA will conduct a security threat assessment by conducting a search of the following databases:
?	Terrorists - internal to Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
?	Immigration - internal to DHS
?	Criminal ? list of disqualifying crimes (Criminal History Record Check)
Applicants will have the option of providing all of the information at an enrollment center or providing the biographic data and scheduling an appointment on-line (pre-enrollment) before their first visit to an enrollment center. This information is subsequently sent to TSA who will manage the security threat assessment and then to a centralized secure card processing and production facility.  The card is then sent back to the initial enrollment station, activated and issued to the enrollee after a positive identification is confirmed.  There are approximately fifty-two (52) Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) facilities, 3,200 maritime facilities and 10,000 vessels which are regulated under the MTSA ?6.6, which will be required to comply with the TWIC regulations.
TSA will be using a contractor, Lockheed Martin (LM) to manage the TWIC System, help desk, and the actual enrollment and the issuance of TWIC. (Section 6.9)
There will be a single version of the TWIC,.  The TWIC will adhere to National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 201 (Section 6.8) standards and will be Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD-12) (Section 6.5) compliantve all system failure issues in a timely manner. (PWS 5.0)	Respond to all system failure issues within 2 business days of notification of failure.	Untimely resolution (more than 2 business days) not caused by the government will be reflected in the contractors past performance evaluation..

6. High quality training related support	All training related material produced by Contractor shall be well designed, clearly written and expertly edited (PWS 5.0)
	The Contractor shall provide experienced biometrics operators for training, develop training indicators of success, metrics of training acquisition, provision of varied training styles, and a phased transition to the users? independent operational performance under trainer supervision	If deliverables are determined to be unacceptable to the COTR and cannot be resolved to the satisfaction of the Government, results may be reflected in the Contractor?s past performance.
7.  The system is fully operational and accessible 24 hours a day, seven days a week
	The Contractor shall be responsible for ensuring the system is accessible to all users and remains fully operational 24 hours a day, seven days a week (PWS 5.0)	No system failures or unscheduled maintenance result in more than a total of 18 hours loss of service during any 30-day period.	A 10% reduction will apply for each failure to achieve the performance standard during each 30-day period of performance (as verified by the COTR).

[The offeror shall enter the name of the small disadvantaged business concern that is participating in the joint venture: ________________.]
(10) HUBZone small business concern. [Complete only if the offeror represented itself as a small business concern in paragraph (c)(1) of this provision.] The offeror represents, as part of its offer, that--

(d) Representations required to implement provisions of Executive Order 11246 --
(1) Previous contracts and compliance. The offeror represents that --
(i) It * has, * has not, participated in a previous contract or subcontract subject to the Equal Opportunity clause of this solicitation; and
(ii) It * has, * has not, filed all required compliance reports.
(2) Affirmative Action Compliance. The offeror represents that --
(i) It * has developed and has on file, * has not developed and does not have on file, at each establishment, affirmative action programs required by rules and regulations of the Secretary of Labor (41 CFR parts 60-1 and 60-2), or
(ii) It * has not previously had contracts subject to the written affirmative action programs requirement of the rules and regulations of the Sec.  The DHS approved ?TWIC Contactless Specification? will be applied to the TWIC as an additional feature enabling it to be read in a contactless manor without a PIN.  The USCG needs hand held readers that will be capable of reading the TWIC in both the contact (PIV) and contactless (TWIC Contactless Specification) modes.  The TWIC Contactless Specification will be published in the coming weeks and readers purchased under this contract must fully incorporate it to enable successful contact and contactless interface with the TWIC.
Although readers are not required to be used by facility/vessel owners/operators under the Final Rule published January 25, 2007, 72  Fed. Reg. 3491, the USCG will be conducting spot checks of the TWIC using hand-held biometric readers.
Currently, there are no FIPS 201 ?6.8 biometric compliant readers that have been tested successfully with TWIC.  Due to concerns regarding the durability of the contact/open slot readers in the maritime environment, owners and operators of regulated facilities and vessels were not required to purchase, install and utilize readers under the first rule. 
Multiple issues, including environmental conditions with contact readers have led to the requirement to conduct pilots with contactless technology in the development of the Contactless Specification for the TWIC and TWIC readers.  To facilitate industry needs and requirements, contactless recommended specifications were developed and published in the Federal Register on 16MAR07, 72 Fed. Reg. 12626  with a 14-day public comment period.  CG-3PCP-2 worked with the TSA and the National Maritime Security Advisory Committee (NMSAC), with membership including biometrics and maritime industry experts, to develop these recommendations.  As previously mentioned, TSA will select and publish the selected contactless specification in the Federal Register in the coming weeks.  This specification will be utilized during the pilot tests required by the SAFE Port Act (Section 6.7) and the results will be utilized to inform the second rulemaking which will propose contactless reader requirements for the regulated facilities and vessels.
When selecting hand held biometric readers for use during USCG spot checks, products must utilize the capabilities of both Contact and Contactless technologies and be capable of accomodating future upgrades necessary to support the TWIC program.

<CONTACT>Susan Cowin Contracting Officer 8015394177     susan_cowin@blm.gov;
<DESC>Solicitation is hereby amended to add the following: Contractor Personnel Security and Suitability Requirements  Performance of this contract requires contractor personnel to have a Federal government-issued personal identification card before being allowed unsupervised access to a DOI facility and/or information system. The Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) will be the sponsoring official, and will make the arrangements for personal identify verification and card issuance.  At least two weeks before start of contract performance, the Contractor will identify all contractor and subcontractor personnel who will require physical and/or logical access for performance of work under this contract. The Contractor must make their personnel available at the place and time specified by the COR in order to initiate screening and background investigations. The following forms, or their equivalent, will be used to initiate the credentialing process: o OPM Standard Form 85 or 85P o OF 306  o Fingerprint card (local procedures may require the fingerprinting to done at a police station; in this case, any charges are to be borne by the contractor) o Release to Obtain Credit Information o PIV card application (web-based) Contractor employees are required to give, and to authorize others to give, full, frank, and truthful answers to relevant and material questions needed to reach a suitability determination. Refusal or failure to furnish or authorize provision of information may constitute grounds for denial or revocation of credentials. Government personnel may contact the contractor personnel being screened or investigated in person, by telephone or in writing, and the Contractor agrees to make them available for such contact.  Alternatively, if an individual has already been credentialed by another agency through OPM, and that credential has not yet expired, further investigation may not be necessary. Provide the COR with documentation that supports the individual's status.  During performance of the contract, the Contractor will keep the COR apprised of changes in personnel to ensure that performance is not delayed by compliance with credentialing processes. Cards that have been lost, damaged, or stolen must be reported to the COR and Issuing Office within 24 hours. Replacement will be at the contractor's expense. If reissuance of expired credentials is needed, it will be coordinated through the COR.  At the end of contract performance, or when a contractor employee is no longer working under this contract, the Contractor will ensure that all identification cards are returned to the COR.  Before starting work under this contract, a National Agency Check (NAC) will be conducted to verify the identity of the individual applying for clearance. Upon successful completion of the NAC process, an identification card will be issued and access granted.  Simultaneously, a NAC with Inquiries (NACI) will be initiated to determine the individual's suitability for the position. If the NACI adjudication is favorable, nothing more needs to be done. If the adjudication is unfavorable, the credentials will be revoked. In the event of a disagreement between the Contractor and the Government concerning the suitability of an individual to perform work under this contract, DOI shall have the right of final determination.  This requirement must be incorporated into any subcontracts that require subcontractor personnel to have regular and routine unsupervised access to a Federally controlled facility for more than 180 calendar days or any unsupervised access to a Federally controlled Level 3 or 4 information system.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR PORTABLE ARM COORDINATE MEASURING MACHINE.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to Answer questions asked before the due date.  Question 1: Line item 11 - (GM Studio Training): Is this for onsite training?  Answer 1: Yes, on-site. Minimum of two days for three people; to include instrument assembly/disassembly, sample measurements, and analysis software operation."  Question 2:  Is a physical standard required if a system is calibrated at the factory and never needs calibration in use?  Answer 2:  (This regards the specification "Calibration: A physical standard shall be supplied to verify system measuring accuracy and to allow for sanity checks and calibration of custom configured probe tips. The standard shall be NIST traceable." (NIST = National Institute of Standards and Technology))  If a physical standard is not deemed necessary for a proposed system, further information must be provided as to why a NIST traceable calibration standard is not necessary citing design theory, field use, instrument recalls, factory service calibration checks, etc. Or if an existing common NIST traceable standard might already exist in our laboratory, such as a gage block set, bar end standards, master balls, etc., that could be used in lieu of a vendor supplied one of unique design, then state such. Either response would be technically evaluated with the spirit of the specification that is for us to be able to independently determine on a periodic basis if the system is measuring within the original specifications.  Question 3:  If a system design is considered sufficient such that normal human operation could not deform or damage a proposed system, would a warning still have to be supplied such as a buzzer, or indicator light if no such feature existed on an "off the shelf" system design?  Answer 3:  (This regards the specification "Overload protection (torque and bending moment): The instrument shall be able to compensate for arm deflections due to torque and bending moments under the instruments own weight over the entire range of motion and provide a warning when excessive torque and bending is being applied.")  If an overload warning sound or indicator is not provided as part of the sytem design, then additional information must be provided regarding strength and stiffness of the design, current industrial applications, repair history for damaged instruments, etc. The proposed system would be technically evaluated with the spirit of the specification, that is if the instrument is deflected excessively through reasonable use, might we damage the instrument or record inaccurate measurements without knowing.  The due date for receipt of offers is not extended Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on August 30. 2007.

Requirement: 

CLIN 0001 1 each Polyanalyst analytical support software V 6.0 or equivalent 

The government is seeking a software suite to support research, indexing, text mining, and data extraction from commercial databases and internet searches.  Commercially available products such as Megaputer's Polyanalyst, or a combination of software tools that provide similar capability are sought.  The government requires 6 copies for installation to networked workstations and 2 copies for installation on laptop computers which will be used in a stand-alone capacity.  Any software licensing should be tied either to the organization or to the individual machine.  The government will require training for 10 people with the initial delivery.

Contractor Questions/Government Answers: 

Question 1. The solicitation speaks of 6 copies for installation to networked workstations and 2 copies for installation on laptop computers. Does the government require 9 copies of the product total? Or 1 original and 8 licenses? Please specify.

Answer 1. Either approach is acceptable.  The government's objective is to have six networked workstations and two laptops with installed software licensed to run the software simultaneously.  If the offeror's licensing model is 1 license per software copy, then 8 licensed copies of the software would be required.  If the offeror's licensing model is such that the licenses and software are severable, then 8 licenses and a single copy of the software would be acceptable.

Question 2. Does the government want training packages (i.e., 5-person pack)
or single classes as required?

Answer 2.  A single class, onsite at the government facility preferred.  

Question 3. Please explain the purpose of listing the Technical
capabilities. 

Answer 3. These are the performance traits an offeror's software application or suite of applications must possess for the government to consider the proposed application or suite of applications acceptable.

Question 4. Does the government expect any onsite technical support for
installation and support?

Answer 4.  The government expects the software to be properly installed and configured on the target machines.  If onsite installation support is required to achieve that, then it should be included in the offer.  If continuing support for the software is required to maintain capability once the software is installed, then that should also be included in the offer.

Question 5. If not, is there an incumbent to provide this support?

Answer 5.  No incumbent.

1. Requiring Authority:  60th Civil Engineering Squadron, Mr. William Zito, 4-4982

2.  Contracting Agency:  60th Contracting Squadron, Travis AFB CA
     
3.  Purchase Request #:    F3Z3847232A003

4.  Description of Requirement:  15 Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) radio transceivers and 1 SCADA radio repeater.

5.  Statutory Authority permitting other than full and open competition:  Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, as implemented by: FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).  Only one brand name and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement.

6.  Justification or Authority for action:

(a.)	Currently Travis AFB has several Microwave Data Systems (MDS) 4700 series radios in use on a SCADA system.  The remainder of the system must be converted to narrowband radio signaling format by 1 Jan 2008 per federal mandate.  Additional MDS 4700 series radios will be used to accomplish this.

(b.)	MDS 4700 series SCADA radios use a proprietary signaling and modulation technique.  In order for the new radios to be compatible with the existing radios MDS 4700 series radios must be purchased again.  

(c.)	Microwave Data System SCADA radios are the only known brand that can satisfy the Government?s requirement.  Integration into the existing SCADA system cannot be accomplished using any other manufacture?s radio equipment.

(d.)	Without this radio equipment Travis AFB will not be able transition it?s SCADA radio network to narrowband radio signaling format.  Failure to convert to narrowband will require the system to cease operating on 1 Jan 2008.  This system is required to provide remote monitoring of wells, sewer lift gates, and chlorination tanks in the interest of the health of workers and residents at Travis AFB.

8. Brand Name:  Microwave Data Systems  

9.  Steps to improve competition:  No additional market research is being done at this time, because this is a one-time requisition.  

10. Certification:  I hereby certify that the above information is complete and accurate.
