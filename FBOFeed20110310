The Cyphercast system comprises the following hardware that the PiSys software supports:</p>
<p>&bull;Encryptors<br />&bull;Cyphercast software scrambler or Gigacrypt hardware scrambler<br />&bull;Smartcards<br />&bull;M-Crypt or PiSys management systems</p>
<p>Cyphercast and its supporting software, PiSys are unique, proprietary satellite audio and video scrambling/descrambling equipment.<br />(End of Justification)</p>

<SUBJECT>ADJUSTABLE POLYPROPYLENE PALLET STRAPS FOR DLA DISTRIBUTION SUSQUEHANNA, NEW CUMBERLAND, PA
<SOLNBR>SP3300-11-Q-0078
<RESPDATE>032511
<CONTACT>Julie A Metzger, Contract Specialist, Phone 717 770-6243, Fax 717-770-7591, Email julie.metzger@dla.mil
<DESC>DLA Distribution Susquehanna intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 to purchase adjustable Polypropylene pallet straps used to secure "packages" to Government pallets moving on towline cart system and moving to other warehouse locations on the installation.
<p>Previous market research was conducted among several strapping manufactures and samples were received and tested by the Government. Struges Manufacturing Company Inc. was the only company to submit a product that met the Governments minimum requirements. Therefore, the Government intends to award a sole source firm fixed price contract to Sturges Manufacturing to satisfy this requirement as follows:</p>
<p>Straps used to secure material loads to standard government winged pallet (48" x 40"). A material load is defined as a single container or multiple containers weighing from one (1) pound up to two thousand (2000) pounds. The height ranges from less than one (1) inch up to sixty-two (62) inches. The width ranges from one (1) inch to the maximum pallet dimension (48" x 40"). The material loads are conveyed via in-floor towline carts. The maximum travel speed of the cart is 90 feet per minute. The cart is subject to numerous stops and starts thereby subjecting the material to movement that may cause it to fall from the pallet and subsequently from the cart. The pallet strap must be easily adjustable to accommodate the wide range of loads. Any hardware used must be made of a material that is durable enough to handle the towline and warehouse conditions yet yielding enough to prevent any type of jams or conditions that may result in mechanical failures and safety concerns. Loops, approximately 6" in diameter, may be used at the ends of the straps to secure the load to the pallet. The use of hooks is prohibited. Because of the varying size of loads to be secured and to avoid any excess strap from tangling or snagging, the straps shall be manufactured in two lengths, approximately 96" and 144", and color coded to quickly and easily differentiate between the sizes. Also, to provide some shock absorption while securing the load to the pallet, the strap shall include an elastic section not to exceed 24" in length. "DDSP Official Use Only" shall be permanently woven or sewn onto the strap in a way such that it is not easily removed.</p>
<p>Interested contractors may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 313221 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may respond by submitted qualifications/capabilities of the company to provide the pallet straps by FRIDAY, MARCH 25, 2011 at 3:30 PM EST to Julie Metzger, Acquisition Operations, DDC J7-AB, J Avenue, Bldg. 404, New Cumberland, PA 17070, Phone: 717-770-6243, Fax: 717-770-7951, or email: Julie.metzger@dla.mil for consideration by the agency. If no affirmative responses are received, a purchase order will be negotiated and awarded to Sturges Manufacturing Company Inc.</p>

<DESC>MARKET SURVEY/REQUEST FOR INFORMATION 
TITLE: Aircraft Inventory, Logistics and Maintenance Replacement Software Application
PURPOSE: 
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Aviation Systems Standards (AVN), Aircraft Maintenance and Engineering Group (AMEG, AJW-34) is seeking interested sources that are capable of providing a Maintenance, Repair and Operations  Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (MRO, COTS) software application.  This software will manage the tracking and scheduling of all maintenance associated with flight inspection aircraft.  It will also be used to manage/control all inventory related to flight inspection aircraft.  This market survey is to provide information for the AMEG to determine if there are existing COTS software based applications suitable to replace the current ILM system.  Vendor submissions will be reviewed by AJW to determine if their application meets the minimum acceptance criteria.  Vendors meeting the minimum criteria may be invited to demo their application.  In order to make this determination the FAA requires interested Vendors to complete the attached survey reflecting the current state of their product or service and provide a cost estimate, for planning purposes, with the product being provided including any additional effort required to meet the requirement.
The survey with a breakout of requirements is provided on a spreadsheet as an attachment to this market survey.  Interested sources are encouraged to provide additional comments explaining their product and/or contemplated solution to meet the criterion.   
All interested parties are advised that the FAA will not pay for any information or any administrative costs incurred that are associated with any response received from industry in response to this Market Survey/RFI.  Therefore, any costs associated with Market Survey/Request for Information submissions including possible future product demonstrations will be solely at the interested party's expense.
Response to this Market Survey:

The FAA prefers that all submittals, including attachments, be submitted electronically to the following email addresses: derrick.rhone-dunn@faa.gov and cc to:  john.hawk@faa.gov.  Please submit in a portable document format (pdf); however, Microsoft Word is acceptable.  If you cannot respond electronically, please send at least two copies by the indicated deadline to:

This is a notice of intent to go Sol Source in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 for the following items:
Mode                       Description                                              QuantityG2110F	                GPS Logger/TX Weight 65g		3616848		Logger Charger and Cable		116753		Logger Programming Cable		1
Vendor:Advanced Telemetry Systems (ATS)470 First Ave N. Box 398Isanti, MN 55040
ATS is the only know source that can meet Agency requirements.  The hardware items named are identical to those used by our collaborating partner agencies (USGS, and the San Diego Zoo).  Use of the same hardware will allow the United State Fish and Wildlife to collect date with the same efficiency as our partner agencies and will allow data to be shared among agencies.  This will allow greater sharing of resources among agencies and will eliminate the need for duplicative work among partners.  
The units by ATS were designed specifically for use with desert tortoises, so the size, shape, and weight of the units are made to a standard set of desert tortoise specifications.  The USGS and the Zoo have had much success with these units.  Last year, the Zoo use GPS data loggers made by another company, but ultimately we could not use them at all because they did not properly fit any desert tortoises.  To avoid this waste of time and money, the Service would prefer to use units that have already been field-tested and are currently in use by other reputable desert tortoise researchers.
In past recovery efforts where data collection was first developed for desert tortoises, many types of GPS tracking and logging was used and tested.  Types ranged from telemetry collars, implants, harnessed GPS devices, and glued on units.   During these years of trial and error, the ATS units proved more reliable and cost effective.

<p>Varian Medical Systems is the world leader and the manufacture of treatment delivery systems for radiation therapy. Varian has supplied the two linear accelerators used by ROB for the majority of patient treatments in the department. Additionally, Varian supplied the treatment planning systems used for the determination of optimal treatment deliveries. All of this hardware is fully integrated through the use of Varian's ARIA patient management system, which maintains the database of patient treatments (an electronic chart) and passes the necessary information to the accelerator each time a patient is to be treated, monitors each treatment to ensure correct delivery and records each treatment, as well as associated imaging documentation in the patient record. The result is a highly sophisticated and complex system which requires specialized knowledge on the part of service personnel in order to correctly diagnose and correct problems. Additionally much of the hardware and all of the software involved is proprietary in nature, with the rights belonging to Varian Medical Systems.</p>
<p>The equipment mentioned above must be maintained using factory trained technicians due to equipment specific and treatment specific software and hardware. Individuals with the required level of training for service of this system and all integrated subsystems are employed exclusively by Varian. Varian continually retrains their service personnel as new hardware and software is released to clinical systems to ensure that the highest level of service is provided. Varian is the sole source of software and updates necessary for proper equipment operation.<br /><br />This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.

<DESC><strong>Introduction<br /></strong>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases. The NIAID, Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, has a requirement to advance the development of new medical countermeasures against the biological agents that are most likely to be used in a terror attack on civilian populations.<br /><strong><br />Description <br /></strong>The primary objective of this solicitation is to support the advanced development of candidate products which consist of a <strong>vaccine component</strong> and a <strong>technology that accelerates the immune response</strong> for use in post-event settings following the intentional release of NIAID Category A and B Priority Pathogens excluding <em>B. anthracis</em> or in response to naturally occurring outbreaks of infectious diseases caused by NIAID Category A and B Priority Pathogens excluding <em>B. anthracis</em>. In these settings, simplicity and efficiency of delivery of vaccine to, and the effectiveness in large numbers of patients are key considerations.
<p>Candidate products that increase vaccine stability and/or reduce logistical requirements are important secondary objectives and would further enhance the capabilities of a candidate product that accelerates the immune response. Anticipated benefits may include: decreased manpower and time required to prepare and administer the vaccine, maximum compliance of the vaccine recipients, and production of a protective immune response with 1-2 doses of vaccine.</p>
<p>Although vaccine components at different stages of development may be proposed, ideally, the vaccine component of a proposed candidate product should demonstrate completion of current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) manufacturing; have undergone a Phase 1 clinical trial; and have produced safety and immunogenicity results that support further clinical development.</p>
<p>Organizations responding to this BAA should have documented expertise in product development, including regulatory submissions, to advance the development and evaluation of candidate products, against biological threats identified as NIAID Category A and B Priority Pathogens (<a href="http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/BiodefenseRelated/Biodefense/research/pages/cata.aspx">http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/BiodefenseRelated/Biodefense/research/pages/cata.aspx</a>) or Top Priority Biological Threats in the HHS, 2007 PHEMCE Implementation Plan (<a href="https://www.medicalcountermeasures.gov/BARDA/PHEMCE/enterprise/strategy/strategy.aspx">https://www.medicalcountermeasures.gov/BARDA/PHEMCE/enterprise/strategy/strategy.aspx</a>).</p>
<p>Eligible candidate products include those for agents identified as NIAID Category A and B Priority Pathogens excluding <em>B. anthracis</em>.</p>
<p>Additional technologies, when applicable, that increase vaccine stability and/or reduce logistical requirements, will be supported as components of the candidate product. Novel delivery platforms may be components of the candidate product to be developed. Cross-cutting platform delivery technologies applicable to more than one vaccine are also of interest. Candidate products include:</p>
<p>1.<strong>Vaccine Component</strong> - The <strong>vaccine component</strong> of a proposed candidate product should demonstrate completion of current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) manufacturing, undergone a Phase 1 clinical trial, and produced safety and immunogenicity results that support further clinical development.</p>
<p>2.<strong>Technology Component </strong></p>
<p>a.The <strong>technology components</strong> used in the proposed candidate product may consist of a new adjuvant, an immune modulator, a formulation technology or a delivery platform designed to enhance the immune response onset for category A excluding <em>B. anthracis</em> and Category B priority pathogen vaccine candidates. Simply changing a vaccine formulation, for example taking a liquid to a stable lyophilized vaccine formulation, would not be sufficient to meet the objectives.</p>
<p>b.<strong>Technology components</strong> should address reduced time to establish immunity with proof of concept efficacy data in animal models that demonstrate efficacy with the proposed vaccine- component and the feasibility of attaining a safety profile that meets all existing U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements.</p>
<p>Capability statements submitted as a result of this announcement should demonstrate the offerors' qualifications and experience, with particular attention to the appropriateness and adequacy of organizational experience, proposed plans and procedures, availability of personnel, and understanding of problems and deficiencies for a variety of functions, including:</p>
<p>1.Development and updating of the Product Development Plan for the candidate product, including regulatory, clinical, non-clinical, and manufacturing activities to be undertaken. <br />2.Manufacturing and formulation process development.<br />3.Manufacturing, characterization and release of pilot lot cGMP material.<br />4.Real time and accelerated vaccine stability testing over the duration of the contract.<br />5.Conduct of non-clinical studies, including all Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling toxicology studies, combination product approvals and multivalent immunogenicity and interference studies, as needed.<br />6.Development, qualification and, where necessary, validation of all assays and reagents needed to support product development.<br />7.Development, submission, and sponsorship of an Investigational New Drug (IND)/combination product application, including compliance with all regulatory requirements.<br />8.Although a resultant contract will not support the design and conduct of Phase 1 clinical trials for vaccine components, the design, conduct, completion, and analysis of a Phase 1 or Phase 2 clinical trial of the candidate product in normal healthy volunteers may be included.<br />9.The provision of clinical and non-clinical samples from all studies to NIAID and, for clinical trials, obtaining future use consent from volunteers for their samples.<br />10.The delivery to the NIAID of 2000 doses of cGMP final container candidate product and all necessary supporting documentation/letters of cross-reference to allow the NIAID to perform subsequent clinical trials or any other Government purpose.</p>
<p><br />It is anticipated that multiple cost reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded for a 5 year period of performance beginning on or about <span style="text-decoration: underline;">April 1, 2012. </span></p>
<p>The NIAID estimates that one or more contracts may be issued for a total cost (direct and indirect costs combined) of up $44.5 million for a five-year period of performance. <strong>Importantly, contract activities will be divided into manageable time frames with initial funding of only the Base Period. Funding of subsequent timeframes will be funded by Options. Each Option will be fully funded when exercised and will be dependent on successful completion of critical predecessor activities, including USG acceptance of associated deliverables when applicable. The critical predecessor activities should constitute Go/No Go criteria for successor activities. The contract budget will be aligned with the Base Period, Options and associated tasks identified in the Product Development Plan and associated Gantt Chart.</strong></p>
<p>Moreover, it is anticipated that the total cost for the award(s) may vary depending upon the scope of the project and the technical objectives of the award(s). The length of time for which funding is requested should be consistent with the nature and complexity of the proposed research. In no event shall the period of performance proposed by an offeror exceed five years.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Agency. This BAA will be available electronically on/about March 25, 2011, and may be accessed through FedBizOpps <a href="http://www.fbo.gov/">http://www.fbo.gov/</a>. This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.</p>

Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane Division plans to enter into a five year Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) with Raytheon Missile Systems, 1151 E Hermans Rd., Tucson, AZ 85734.
  The BOA will have a ceiling in the amount of $12,500,000.00.  The BOA may include Job Orders in accordance with the Statement of Work for the following:  engineering, logistics and test support, test item hardware and software, support equipment hardware and software, prototypes, test and assembly fixtures, repair services, training, and various data products.  This requirement will be negotiated on a sole source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  The basis for restricting competition is that the only known responsible source that can satisfy these requirements is Raytheon Missile Systems (RMS) because only it possesses the critical vehicle information and possesses the qualified vehicle design in addition to duplicative costs and time that would be required to reverse engineer the systems.
  Since this is a sole source procurement, a solicitation will not be posted to the internet.  Responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  It is the responsibility of the offeror to submit offers to the Point of Contact (POC) at NSWC Crane.  The POC for information regarding this requirement is Mr. Matthew Lucas, Code CXMN, telephone (812)854-8864, fax 812-854-3805 or send a request via e-mail (E-MAIL preferred) to matthew.m.lucas@navy.mil.

The design phase is followed by the development phase in which fully functioning demonstration units are developed and put through government land-based testing. In the fabrication phase, fully robust shipboard-ready demonstration prototypes are fabricated for shipboard testing. Demonstration prototypes of two or more different production capacities are targeted in this solicitation. Overall system designs are sought that minimize system volume and mass with very little manning requirements for operation and maintenance to meet program objectives, while maximizing production of water that meets the EPA Primary and Secondary Drinking Water Standards.
<p>White Papers are required prior to submitting a Full Proposal.</p>
<p>An Industry Day for this solicitation is scheduled to take place on March 31, 2011 from 3:00 to 6:00 pm at the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Long Beach, CA. For more information go to:</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<p>SYNOPSIS: The US Coast Guard (USCG) seeks to award one contract for the procurement of a commercially off the shelf (COTS), suitable and proven Electronic Flight Display System (EFDS) for the USCG HC-130H Avionics I Upgrade (A1U) Project. This contract will consist of a two-year base and three (3) one-year option periods, not to exceed a total of five years. The base period will consist of a firm fixed price NRE effort and the purchase of approximately 3 ship sets to be installed in prototype aircraft and a System Integration Lab. The option periods will be for EFDS ship sets for approximately 15 fleet aircraft plus approximately 2 ship sets for USCG initial sparing. The exact numbers of ship sets ordered during each option period will be estimates contingent on funding. Select Engineering and Technical Support Services during the base and each option period may be ordered by labor hour. This requirement will be satisfied by using commercial acquisition procedures specified in FAR Part 12 and negotiated procedures specified in FAR Part 15.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: The USCG HC-130H long range surveillance maritime patrol aircraft is undergoing a series of upgrades to enable the continued effective and safe operation of the HC-130H through the year 2027. The first group of avionics upgrades (i.e. A1U) addresses critical modernization issues including internationally mandated Communications Navigation Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) requirements, flight safety, mission performance, interoperability, component obsolescence and related mission availability concerns. The USCG Aviation Acquisitions Program Office (CG-931) is utilizing the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), Program Manager Air, Air Combat Electronics program office (PMA 209), as the Integrating Agent for the A1U project. The A1U project has completed the system requirements definition, system functions allocation, and initial design development, and has finalized the system level technical architecture. The A1U technical architecture is based upon CNS/ATM architectures developed by joint PMA 209 / contractor teams for the Navy's P-3C, C2A, E-2, and the Marine Corps CH-53 aircraft. Incorporating this A1U architecture into the HC-130H host requires subsystem additions, replacements, removals and applicable modifications to the host platform systems and interfaces. The A1U architecture will integrate and manage different hardware/ software systems &amp; equipment, most of which have not been previously employed in the HC-130H. This technical architecture includes the following major A1U subsystems described by function: Flight Management System (FMS); Navigation System; Autopilot System; Communications System; Identification &amp; Surveillance System; and Electronic Flight information Displays System (EFDS). The Flight Management System (FMS) will use the CDU-7000 (proven successful for Navy, USCG, and Army avionics upgrade projects) to control all data and information flow to and from the EFDS components. The EFDS subsystems will contain digital "glass cockpit" integrated flat panel displays (aka multifunction displays), their data processors, a Caution Warning &amp; Advisory Panel (CWAP), an Electronic Chart Server, associated Display Control Panels (DCPs) and Hand Controllers.</p>
<p>SCOPE OF WORK: The party must provide and demonstrate a suitable, proven, high quality, readily producible &amp; supportable COTS EFDS that fits into and works with the current A1U design and HC-130H legacy systems. The party will need to perform non recurring engineering, technical, integrated logistics, manufacturing, subcontract and overall EFDS project management tasks, to successfully integrate a suitable, proven EFDS product for the USCG HC-130H Avionics I Upgrade (A1U) - to include providing associated functional integration and A1U system level testing and demonstration assets and their support. This EFDS work effort will require close technical coordination and cooperation with other key A1U contractors. This EFDS effort will also include creating and providing to the USCG the EFDS familiarization training and the EFDS engineering and associated integrated logistics and manufacturing technical data (drawings, manuals, etc).</p>
<p>USCG TOP LEVEL REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>A. A proposed EFDS will readily accommodate the existing physical, functional, and information processing and display requirements for the A1U system and its discrete subsystems. This includes providing/integrating all hardware, software and interface modifications needed to meet the applicable CNS/ATM exhibition and other performance requirements of the EFDS such as:</p>
<p>- Display of Required Navigation Performance for Area Navigation (RNP RNAV) data.<br />- Display of required Barometric Vertical Navigation (Baro VNAV) data.<br />- Display of communication radio data.<br />- Display of dual Embedded GPS/INS (EGI) data.<br />- Display of dual ARN-118 TACAN, dual ARN-123 VOR, ARN-149, and DF-430 data.<br />- Display of Digital Video/Imagery.<br />- Control and display of digital mapControl and display of electronic chart data.<br />- Display of Terrain Avoidance &amp; Warning System (TAWS) data.<br />- Display of Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) data.</p>
<p>The system must also have growth capability to meet the following future requirements:</p>
<p>- Joint Precision Approach Landing System (JPALS).<br />- Mobile User Objective System (MUOS).<br />- Display of flight director data.</p>
<p><br />B. A proposed EFDS will be based on avionics COTS components readily available and certifiable for installation and integration into commercial and military aircraft.</p>
<p>C. Interested parties should be advised that within 30 days after contract award that they must participate and support a Subsystem Technical Review to ensure the system can proceed into detailed design, and can meet the stated performance requirements within cost, schedule, risk and other system constraints. A Critical Design Review will be convened 90 days after contract award, followed shortly thereafter by an Installation Readiness Review and then the initiation of the A1U modification efforts to the prototype aircraft.</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong>:</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) developed a HIV Prevention Strategic Plan to guide efforts during the third decade of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. One of the four major goals of the HIV Prevention Strategic Plan is to "strengthen the capacity nationwide to monitor the epidemic..." The objectives related to this goal include developing an integrated surveillance system that will "monitor behaviors that place people at risk for HIV infection and provide locally relevant data for community planning." An additional objective is to "develop a system to track disease, including prevalence of HIV, AIDS, and other Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs), incidence of AIDS and STDs, and HIV drug resistance and care utilization." In response to the strategic plan, CDC's Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention (DHAP) implemented two surveillance systems designed to supplement the HIV/AIDS case surveillance system: the National HIV Behavioral Surveillance System (NHBS) and the Medical Monitoring Project (MMP). <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The National HIV Behavioral Surveillance <br /></span>The NHBS is CDCs most comprehensive system for conducting behavioral surveillance among persons at the highest risk for HIV infection in the US. In Fiscal Year 2010, CDC began the third round of NHBS funding through cooperative agreements with health departments. CDC developed the NHBS system to help state and local health departments establish and maintain a surveillance system to monitor selected behaviors and the use of prevention programs and services in groups at highest risk for HIV infection. NHBS, a community-based data collection system, currently functions in 21 cities and states throughout the US with plans to function in no more than 21 cities and states in the future. Findings from NHBS will enhance understanding and development of HIV prevention programs in these communities.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Medical Monitoring Project <br /></span>The MMP is the largest HIV supplemental surveillance system conducted by CDC. MMP began its second round of funding through a cooperative agreement with health departments beginning in fiscal year 2009. The purpose of MMP is to produce population-based estimates of characteristics of persons with HIV infection living in the US and the care they receive. Estimates developed using probability-based sampling are intended to be representative of the population diagnosed with and receiving care for HIV in the US. Findings from MMP will enhance public health policy, HIV prevention program planning, and evaluation of cost associated with the epidemic. The MMP multistage cluster sampling design is complex, and the services required for data management support are specialized. MMP currently functions in 16 states, the commonwealth of Puerto Rico and 6 separately funded cities in the US with plans to function in no more than 19 states, the commonwealth of Puerto Rico and 6 separately funded cities in the future.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Data Coordinating Center <br /></span>Given the size and complexity of HIV supplemental surveillance (NHBS and MMP), the $20 million annual investment in funding to health departments, and the critical need for these key data for HIV prevention, data management must meet or exceed standards for best practices. The NHBS and MMP require a comprehensive data management system that begins with setting up sampling frames, providing technical assistance, coordinating data collection to data processing, weighting, and data analysis, and all the way through to achieving a secure and timely means for data dissemination. Attempts at managing these data early on from 2004 to 2007 failed to produce data sets within an acceptable time frame. In response, CDC funded a contract to evaluate current operations and recommend best practices for NHBS and MMP data management. Following those recommendations, a new data management contract was developed and awarded at the end of fiscal year 2008. Shortly after the award, The Data Coordinating Center (DCC) was established and became fully functional by June, 2008. The DCC marked a change from the "bit by bit" data management processes of the past and instead operates a highly coordinated life cycle system producing higher quality data sets in less time and at less cost than previous MMP and NHBS data management processes.</p>
<p>The DCC provides comprehensive data management life-cycle support for NHBS and MMP and utilizes the DCC data portal to support and maintain the data management life-cycle for NHBS and MMP. The DCC data portal is a secure Web-based system for receiving, maintaining, processing, and disseminating NHBS and MMP data. The DCC data portal facilitates and improves communications between CDC, project areas, and the Contractors supporting DCC functions. The portal provides a central location for project areas to acquire submission-related information, exchange data with the DCC and CDC, and monitor data collection and submission activities with a focus on quality assurance.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose and Objectives</strong>:</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to provide support to maintain the existing comprehensive standardized data management life-cycle system for the NHBS and MMP national surveillance systems and to refine existing processes and implement improvements to the existing system that will achieve more efficient management of the data life-cycle and provide higher data quality based on the tasks outlined in the attached draft Statement of Work (SOW).</p>
<p><strong>Capability Statement</strong>:</p>
<p>Vendors who believe they have the ability to satisfy all of the tasks outlined in the attached draft SOW are encouraged to submit a capability statement.

<DESC>Brief Summary: The purpose of this Sources Sought Notice (SSN) is to conduct market research to identify companies who possess the necessary capabilities and resources to support the requirements stated herein and to identify any commercial items that are available to meet the Government's need.  <br><br>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) Project Manager for Combined Arms Tactical Trainers (PM CATT), Assistant Project Manager (APM) for Medical Simulation (MedSim) has a requirement for the procurement of the production and installation of systems and equipment that comprise various Medical Simulation Training Center (MSTC) configurations; retrofitting existing systems to match current technological advancements; and a configuration design and installation plan for a transportable MSTC.  <br><br>The MSTCs are a standardized Army training asset located at various military installations worldwide, delivering effective medical training with a standardized training platform to better prepare Soldiers for application of medical interventions under combat conditions.  The MSTC provides medical training and education on new battlefield procedures and equipment, while affording Soldiers the ability to provide comprehensive training in several formats such as the classroom setting, practical hands-on training simulation, trauma lanes, and distance learning.<br><br>Each MSTC provides a medical skills training platform where Soldiers obtain sustainment and validate their medical skills in accordance with Training Circular (TC) No.  8-800, Semi-Annual Combat Medic Skills Validation Test (SACMS-VT), Combat Medical Advanced Skills Training (CMAST) and the Combat Life Saver (CLS) Programs of Instruction (POI).  The MSTC POIs, provided by The U.S.  Army Medical Department Center and School (AMEDDC&S), include Medical Education and Demonstration of Individual Competence (MEDIC), Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TC3CMAST, and CLS.  <br><br>This requirement will equip and standardize existing MSTCs with upgraded capabilities and establish new MSTC locations with the potential of the following configurations and annual student throughput: MSTC Initial (I)-2,500; MSTC Standard (S)-2,500; MSTC Medium (M)-1,500; MSTC Small (Sm)-750; and MSTC Transportable (T)-750.  Note that the MSTC (I) represents the current fielded configuration and will be retrofitted to incorporate system and equipment upgrades contained in the MSTC (S) configuration.  Also note that part of this requirement is to design and field the MSTC (T).  <br><br>At present, the MSTC program has fielded an Initial Operational Capability (IOC) of 18 MSTC systems with the Initial (I) configuration.  The MSTC program's Full Operational Capability (FOC) currently requires 34 MSTC Standardized (S) configurations.<br><br>The MSTC (I) and the MSTC (S) configuration require modifiable and reconfigurable capabilities. Each configuration is a fixed building facility; however, it is noted that the construction of these MSTC buildings is NOT part of this requirement.  Typical features of a MSTC facility include reconfigurable/expandable classrooms, validation rooms, virtual training/computer learning room an instrumented control room, etc.  <br><br>The MSTC (T) configuration requires a unique design limited to the following parameters:<br>1) Unit must be transportable to any U.S.  location, Europe or Korea using public transportation standards<br>2) Provide all training capability of the fixed MSTC (Sm) configuration with throughput requirements of 750 students annually<br>3) Unit must be capable of being placed into training environment and operational within one (1) hour of arrival on the training site<br>4) Design must provide the outdoor environmental effects for two (2) medical lanes at least 100 meters long.<br><br>Each MSTC configuration will consist of a Virtual Patient System (VPS), Instruction Support System (ISS), Medical Training Command and Control (MT-C2), Medical Training Evaluation System (MTES) and Medical Training and Validation Lanes.  NOTE:  The development and production of the MT-C2 and MTES will be procured under a separate acquisition, which has not yet been initiated.  These items will be furnished as Government Furnished Property (GFP) upon completion.<br><br>The contractor will be responsible for procuring all equipment associated with the VPS, ISS, and various elements of the MT-C2 and MTES.  The contractor will ensure that all systems and equipment be integrated and interoperable with the GFP and vice versa.  Together, this suite of systems will provide a standardized design and training methodology, which maximizes a reconfigurable, modifiable, and sustainable training capability to fully meet contemporary operating environment (COE) and future operational environments (FOE) training requirements.<br><br>Virtual Patient System (VPS)<br>The VPS contains all MSTC training devices and critical technologies.  Training devices include bleed/breath patient mannequins, dead-weighted mannequins, airway management mannequins, partial task trainers and moulage kits that replicate the trauma of multiple wound sites on a single patient.  A representative list of equipment required for the VPS is identified in Attachment A of this notice.<br><br>Instruction Support System (ISS)<br>The ISS provides all instructional support technology components with critical technologies capable of internet-based curriculum and scenario integration, virtual and distributed learning functions.  ISS components include the MSTC facility's training equipment, certified training instructors and staff, POIs, technical and operational maintenance, virtual learning capabilities, and environmental effects equipment such as audiovisual enhancements and camera surveillance capability.  These technologies support smart systems enabling training customization, data mining and sharing, virtual classrooms and distributed learning, and capable of synchronizing with MT-C2, VPS, and MTES components.  The MSTC POIs are provided by the AMEDDC&S.  As such, they are not part of this requirement.  Additionally, the certified training instructors, staff and technical and operational maintenance are NOT part of this requirement.  A representative list of equipment required for the ISS is identified in Attachment A of this notice.<br><br>Medical Training Command and Control (MT-C2)<br>The MT-C2 System will be a control center allowing remote training platform management. During a training event, Soldiers perform tasks on training devices inside scalable and adjustable scenarios within the simulated environments. The MT-C2 will enable training environment manipulation, medical scenario integration, mannequin control, audio video (AV) surveillance, recording, hostile and friendly force engagement control. The MT-C2 will provide the capability to manipulate the environments in which scenarios take place in order to maximize the positive impact and training experience of each fluid training event in the training experience. A representative list of equipment required for the MSTC (I), MSTC (M), and MSTC (Sm) configurations that support the MT-C2's initial capability is identified in Attachment A of this notice.  Because the MT-C2 is in the developmental stage, the standardized MT-C2 will be provided as GFP for installation at each site and for each configuration. <br><br>Medical Training Evaluation System (MTES)<br>The MTES provides a capability to assess the quality of the training experience by allowing student to complete an automated survey resulting in enabling training events to be focused, evaluated, and reviewed.  The MTES provides testing components for pre-testing training requirement determination, post testing for training performance evaluation and an after action review component.  These capabilities work to produce an objective, quantifiable and repeatable measurement of training effectiveness.  A representative list of equipment required for the MSTC (I), MSTC (M), and MSTC (Sm) configurations that support the MT-C2's initial capability is identified in Attachment A of this notice.  Because the MTES is in the developmental stage, the MTES will be provided as GFP for installation at each site and for each configuration.<br><br>Medical Training Lanes<br>Each configuration will include outside medical/validation training areas to maximize the use of blended reality and multi-use capabilities.  These outdoor medical training and validation lanes will incorporate a mounted/dismounted Military Operations on Urban Terrain (MOUT), traditional battlefield and litter obstacle lanes for training 68W and CLS certification/recertifications.  Although the MOUT capability is NOT part of this requirement, additional equipment required for the medical training lanes is and is identified in Attachment A of this notice.<br><br>ACQUISITION APPROACH: In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation, Part 10, Market Research, the Government is conducting market research to identify companies who possess the necessary capabilities and resources to support the requirements stated herein and to identify any commercial items that are available to meet the Government's need. The period of performance will be a one (1) year base period with four (4) one-year options. <br><br>QUANTITIES: The Government anticipates the delivery of two (2) new MSTC (I) configurations within the first 12 months of contract award.  The number of sites for the option periods will be determined on a year-by-year basis; however, it is expected that four (4) to six (6) MSTC (I) or (S) configurations will be fielded each year until FOC is reached at 34 MSTC (S) systems.  The quantities for the MSTC (M), (Sm) and (T) configurations are unknown at this time.  All MSTC (I) systems will be retrofitted to meet the (S) configuration, at such point that the MT-C2 and MTES systems are completed and delivered as GFP. All MSTCs, regardless of size, will receive technical refresh equipment, as directed by the Government.<br><br>ESTIMATED DOLLAR VALUE: $85 Million  <br><br>RESPONSES REQUESTED: <br>Interested offerors are requested to provide a capabilities statement that confirms, at a minimum, significant knowledge and experience providing the requirements stated herein and familiarity with areas of Medical Training Simulation and U.S. Army Medical Department (AMEDD).

Manufacturers will be given one hour to present and answer questions from the group.  Sales or promotional information should not be presented.  

Interested parties should contact Gail A Hixon, Contracting Officer, via email gail.hixon@va.gov no later than March 21, 2011.

<DESC>The proposed contract is to acquire professional, technical support services for the 711 Human Performance Wing, Plans &amp; Programs Division. The services to be provided will support current laboratory animal research projects at Brooks City-Base TX. Services shall include animal housing and care, research protocol support, animal disposal, veterinarian services (on-call or as needed depending on the protocol), associated gases (nitrogen/oxygen/helium). Services shall be for use by 711 HPW and its affiliates. This effort is will be awarded for a period not to exceed twelve months, at an anticipated value below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold. The government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1) and FAR 6.302-1(a) (2) (iii). The proposed source is BRIDGE PTS, as Bridge PTS is leasing the animal facility from Brooks Development Agency, they are considered the only service provider capable of meeting requirements. The animal care and feeding must be accomplished on-site at Brooks City-base, Texas, as transportation to/from the site will provide undue stress on the research animals and skew the test results. The justification for other than full and open competition is attached to this notice and fulfills the requirement in FAR 6.305. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, any quotation received within fifteen (15) days of the issuance of this notice will be considered by the government. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<p>The Kaibab, Prescott and Tonto National Forests plan to secure contracts for professional surveying services as required for the administration of National Forest System Lands (NFSL) in Northern Arizona. The work will involve professional surveying services, primarily marking property boundaries of land within National Forest Proclamation Boundaries located in Coconino, Gila, Maricopa, Mohave, Pinal and Yavapai Counties, but exclude lands administered by the Apache-Sitgreaves and Coronado National Forests<br />The Forest Service anticipates award of one to four Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contracts for a five year period from date of award. The cumulative total for a typical task order issued under a contract is estimated at $5,000.00 - $50,000.00. An Arizona Registered Professional Land Surveyor must be assigned to each task order. Only firms with Registered Professional Surveyor(s) licensed in the state in of Arizona will be considered.<br />Tasks include, but are not limited to, identification, monumentation and perpetuation of property corners and controlling corners for land surveys performed to locate property boundaries, boundary line posting and maintenance of previously posted lines. Work may include retracement of Rectangular Surveys of the Public Land Survey System, including section subdivision, as well as retracement of Homestead Entry Surveys and Mineral Surveys. Most all work will require the results of survey plat to be recorded in the public record. The projects may also include right-of-way surveys, topographic surveys, geodetic control, mapping and other incidental work normally associated with the survey profession. A map of the general work area is available by contacting rjjackson@fs.fed.us. <br />Estimated award date is on or about May 15, 2011. Individual task orders will be issued against each contract as needed to accomplish the work. Completion time will vary with each individual task order, and may be negotiated. The contracts will not preclude the Forest Service from using its own surveyors, other surveying firms or Bureau of Land Management Cadastral crews to perform surveys in the project area. <br />Firms responding to this announcement before the closing date will be considered for selection, subject to any limitations with respect to size and geographic location of firm, specialized technical expertise and other requirements listed. Following an initial evaluation of the qualification and performance data submitted, firms that are considered to be the most highly qualified to provide the type of services required will be chosen for negotiation. Selection of firms for negotiation shall be made through an order of preference based on demonstrated competence and qualification necessary for the satisfactory performance of the type of professional services required. <br />Firms qualified and interested in providing professional surveying services of the type listed above are hereby invited to submit Standard Form 330, Architect-Engineer and Related Services Questionnaire. <br />This is a 100% total small business set-aside. NAICS Code applicable is 541370 and the size standard is $4.5 million.</p>
<p>Your SF- 330 form, or an attachment (preferred), should specifically address these areas: <br />(1) Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services.</p>
<p>&bull; Identify the Registered Professional Land Surveyors and "CFedS" Certified Surveyors who will be assigned to the task orders. Discuss their recent experience in retracement of Public Land Surveys.

<p>(2) Capacity of the firm to provide the required services in the required time.</p>
<p>&bull; List your firm's available personnel, and procedures used to ensure reasonable deadlines are met. Include any proposed subcontractor and specify what duties they would perform.</p>
<p>(3) Past performance on contracts with government agencies or private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work and compliance with performance schedules.</p>
<p>&bull; Reference projects that are similar in scope to cadastral surveys and boundary line marking.</p>
<p>(4) Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required.</p>
<p>&bull; Highlight projects involving rural boundary surveys which required property line marking performed by the key personnel that will be assigned to the work. Proposal should also include the firms' quality control plan for field and office work.</p>
<p>(5) Proximity of the firm to local project area</p>
<p>&bull; When project areas are beyond a 60 mile radius of your firm's headquarters or branch office, provide your plan or procedure to provide services in a cost-effective manner.</p>
<p>(6) Cadastral Survey knowledge, records research, and resolution of conflicting evidence.</p>
<p>&bull; Discuss your firm's knowledge of cadastral survey practices, records research and the approach you have used on previous surveys to resolve problems resulting from conflicting title or physical evidence. Submit a Record of Survey from a boundary survey sealed by a licensed land surveyor who will conduct, or be in responsible charge of boundary surveys under an awarded contract. The survey should demonstrate principles relevant to these criteria.</p>
<p>Please submit three (3) complete copies of the requested information by the due date of April 7, 2011, 4:30 p.m. local time to:</p>

Agency Contact Information:Acquisition Services DirectorateNational Business CenterDepartment of the Interior381 Elden Street, Suite 4000Herndon, VA 20170
Place of Performance:  Washington, DC
The Government intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, a firm-fixed-price (FFP) acquisition with Global Insight. This non-competitive action is being issued by the Acquisition Services Directorate under the authority of the Department of the Interior Franchise Fund on the behalf of the United Stated Department of Agriculture (USDA), Foreign Agricultural Services (FAS).  
Description of Requirement:  
This is a subscription to Global Insight Global Macroeconomic Analysis Service and for Global Insight to perform GSM102 price review activities. Global Insight is the world's largest macroeconomic analysis and forecasting firm.  Its products available on the web, and not available from other sources, include the Advanced Country Analysis and Forecast Service, China Regional Service, Global Consumer Markets Service, and Comprehensive U.S. Economic Service.  These resources will be available to not only FAS/W staff, but also to FAS/F, ERS, the World Board, and OCE. This information is used by all employees to analyze county, market, and commodity production, trade and price data. FAS still operates the GSM 102 program which requires statutorily price reviews to be done by Office of Global Analysis (OGA).  Given the other analytical demands, OGA does not have the resources to build an in-house price review capability.   Global Insight has the expertise and resources to provide this service. 
This action is being processed in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source, and solicited in accordance with FAR 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  Global Insight currently provides these types of subscriptions.  No other organization is known to provide these type of subscriptions.  However, interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities regarding this requirement by submitting a capabilities statement by the date specified herein.  
The period of performance for this effort will be one year.  The Government will consider all capabilities statements received by 12pm EST, Wednesday, March 23, 2011.  Please be advised that it is the offeror's responsibility to assure the Government receives your submission on or before the specified due date.  Submissions shall be sent electronically to Michael McGuire, Contracting Officer at mike.mcguire@aqd.nbc.gov.
This is NOT a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based upon responses to this announcement is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received is solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive acquisition. The Government reserves the right to issue a Request for Quote (RFQ) as a result of this announcement.  Please be advised that this announcement may constitute the only notice that will be posted for this acquisition, based on the review of any responses to this notice.

<SUBJECT>Notice of Opportunity for Collaboration with the Glycemic Reduction Approaches in Diabetes: A Comparative Effectiveness (GRADE) study
<SOLNBR>NIHLM2011-DK01
<RESPDATE>063011

<DESC>Notice of Opportunity for Collaboration with the Glycemic Reduction Approaches in Diabetes: A Comparative Effectiveness (GRADE) study<br />
<p><br />The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) seeks collaborations with industry to provide therapeutic agents and supplies for a study of patients with type 2 diabetes with a known duration of less than 3 years.</p>
<p>The epidemic of type 2 diabetes that has affected the U.S. and other populations in the last half of the 20th and first part of the 21st centuries threatens to become the major public health problem of this century. The most recent estimates in the U.S. include a prevalence of approximately 24.5 million persons with type 2 diabetes, with an incidence of 1.8 million new cases per year. One of the major challenges for practitioners is to choose the best means for initially achieving and then maintaining an appropriate level of glycemic control over time. Unfortunately, there is a dearth of head-to-head comparator studies of different glucose-lowering medications, either alone or in combinations. Moreover, only a few studies have examined the durable effects of interventions on glycemic control. Given the importance of achieving and maintaining adequate glycemic control over time, it is critical to understand the relative effectiveness of the different medications and their combinations, and whether introducing them sequentially, the traditional treatment strategy, or initially in combination is most effective in maintaining glycemic goals over time.</p>
<p>This trial will compare: <br />1. The relative benefits of five anti-diabetic medications, with different glucose lowering mechanisms, when used in conjunction with metformin, and <br />2. Two treatment strategies: the introduction of combination therapy early in the course of diabetes care (early combination therapy) and sequential therapy to determine which strategy will provide improved glycemic control over time.</p>
<p>The trial will be conducted at clinical centers throughout the United States of America with expertise in the conduct of clinical trials in type 2 diabetes. These centers will enroll 7,500 patients with type 2 diabetes over approximately 3 years. The average duration of follow-up is expected to be approximately 4 years. The Study Chair for this clinical trial is David Nathan, MD from Massachusetts General Hospital, and the Coordinating Center will be the George Washington University Biostatistics Center.</p>
<p>In supporting this trial, the NIDDK wishes to provide important currently unavailable data on the comparative efficacy, safety, tolerability, and effects on other clinically relevant factors of currently available medications to treat diabetes that will help inform physicians when making treatment decisions. Additionally the results of this trial may inform organizations in the development of policy and treatment guidelines.</p>
<p>This notice is being provided to ensure that potential collaborators have sufficient time to respond to the opportunity.</p>
<p>Additional information about the study can be found at<br />http://www2.bsc.gwu.edu/bsc/grade.html</p>
<p>Details of the collaboration opportunity and Capability Statements are provided below.</p>
<p>Research Initiative Details<br />The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is seeking proposals in the form of capability statements from companies that are interested in collaborating with The Glycemia Reduction Approaches in Diabetes: A Comparative Effectiveness (GRADE) Study group by providing selected currently approved therapeutic agents and diagnostic markers or devices or supplies. These could include the following:<br />-Metformin<br />-Sulfonylureas<br />-Thiazolidinediones<br />-Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors<br />-Glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists<br />-Long- and intermediate-acting insulin<br />-Glucose meters and strips<br />-Any other equipment or testing supplies (e.g. syringes, lancets, etc) or agent that is consistent with the research objectives of the GRADE Study.</p>
<p>In NIDDK's selection of product to be used in the study, preference will be given to agents based on effectiveness in lowering glycemia, safety profile, tolerability and convenience of administration.</p>
<p>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Collaborative arrangements may be made under a transactional agreement e.g. a Clinical Trial Agreement (CTA) or Clinical Material Supply Agreement (CMSA), as appropriate. These agreements are designed to enable certain collaborations between the federal Government and non-Government entities. They are not grants or contracts for the procurement of goods/services. Therefore, NIDDK is prohibited from transferring funds to a collaborator under these transactional agreements. However, NIDDK can contribute facilities, staff, materials, and expertise to the effort. The collaborator typically contributes materials and sometimes, in addition, facilities, staff, expertise, and/or funding to the collaboration. Please contact Anna Amar at the contact information given below for further details on mechanisms for collaboration.</p>
<p>CAPABILITY STATEMENTS: The NIDDK will utilize the information provided in the Collaborator Capability Statements received in response to this announcement to help in implementation of the GRADE Study. It is the intention of the NIDDK that all qualified Collaborators have the opportunity to provide information to be used for selection through their capability statements. The Capability Statement should not exceed 10 pages of narrative and should address the following selection criteria:</p>
<p>--The statement should include a detailed plan demonstrating the ability to provide, without charge, sufficient quantities of the material in a timely manner for the duration of the study which is anticipated to be 7 years. Approximately 7500 subjects will be treated with metformin, and approximately 1500 subjects will receive each of the other listed therapeutic agents.</p>
<p>--The statement may include outcome measures of interest to the Collaborator. The specifics of the proposed outcome measures and the proposed support should include but not be limited to treatment and evaluation of type 2 diabetes, services, facilities, equipment, or other resources.</p>
<p>--If appropriate, specific funding commitment to support the advancement of scientific research.<br />The Collaborator must agree to have data collection and analysis performed by the Coordinating Center at the George Washington University Biostatistics Center (or other study-specified facility).</p>
<p><br />--A description of the methods that would be used to assure privacy and maintain confidentiality of data.</p>
<p>--The Collaborator must agree to share (with NIDDK and the GRADE Study Group) any new safety data from other studies involving any therapeutic agents or diagnostic device as well as relevant efficacy data from other studies (updated Investigator Brochure, or package insert).</p>
<p>--The statement must address willingness to promptly publish research results.</p>
<p>SUBMISSION DATES: Only written capability statements received by the NIDDK on or before June 30, 2011 will be considered. Applicants meeting the criteria as set forth in this announcement will be invited at the Applicant's own expense to discuss with the GRADE Study Steering Committee their plans, capabilities, and research findings pertinent to the study.</p>

The suggested contractor is MarketLab, Inc., a small business.<br><br>MarketLab is the only contractor at this point of renovation which is feasible to procure all of these requirements from the same site in order to expedite the process and due to a short suspense in which to acquire all of the items needed for the new OB/GYN Clinic opening.  If we were to order all requirements from different vendors it would cause an unnecessary delay.  Urgency is the basis for the justification.  The chronological events leading up to this requirement is due to the equipping of the OB/GYN Clinic after a large renovation project.  The funds and budget were only recently made available to procure the needed items.  Without the items arriving in a timely manner it would impact our mission and ability to care for patients and ultimately delay the opening date of the Clinic..<br><br>This is not a request for proposal.  However, companies that can provide an equal product must submit their technical capabilities to include complete and detailed technical specifications of their product, past performance information, price, and delivery time.

<p>SECTION C STATEMENT OF WORK<br />C1 Introduction &amp; Background<br />The contractor will perform a limited scope actuarial audit of the RRB's statement of social insurance and the related underlying actuarial projection process.<br />The Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) is issuing this Request for Proposals (RFP) to assist the OIG with its annual audit(s) of the RRB's financial statements.<br />The RRB is an independent agency in the executive branch of the Federal government. Its primary function is to administer comprehensive retirement-survivor and unemployment-sickness insurance benefit programs for the nation's railroad workers and their families. These programs are provided under the Railroad Retirement Act (RRA) and the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act (RUIA). In addition, the RRB has administrative responsibilities under the Social Security Act for certain benefit payments and Medicare coverage for railroad workers.<br />The RRB publishes audited financial statements in its annual Performance and Accountability Report, the form and content of which is mandated by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The agency prepares its financial statements from the books and records of the RRB in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) has recognized the statements of Federal Financial Accounting Standards (SFFAS) promulgated by the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB) as GAAP for Federal government entities.<br />During FY 2010, the Railroad Retirement program paid over $10 billion in benefits and reported approximately $30 billion in assets at fiscal year-end. The RRB's financial statements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010 reported total financing sources in excess of $11 billion which it received primarily from payroll taxes and the financial interchange with the Social Security Administration. The bulk of the RRB's financing sources are expended on benefits for railroad workers. <br />The agency's FY 2010 financial statements reported total assets of approximately $6 billion which were comprised primarily of investments with the Treasury and receivables from the Social Security Administration for the financial interchange. The balance of the Railroad Retirement program's assets, approximately $24 billion, were held and invested by the National Railroad Retirement Investment Trust (NRRIT). The NRRIT prepares and publishes financial reports separate from the RRB.<br />Statement of Social Insurance<br />The statement of social insurance is a comparative financial statement comprised of estimates of income and expenditures for a 75-year period for the railroad retirement program. The required notes to the statement of social insurance include significant underlying assumptions, fund balances as of the valuation date for each of the years presented, and identifies the elements of the closed group estimate. <br />Requirement for a Statement of Social Insurance<br />SFFAS #17, as amended, requires Federal agencies that are responsible for social insurance programs to present a statement of social insurance as one of its audited financial statements. SFFAS #17 specifically identifies the Railroad Retirement program as a social insurance program subject to this reporting requirement.<br />The information required by paragraphs 27(3) and 32(3) of SFFAS #17 and paragraphs 28 and 29 of SFFAS #37 are presented in a basic financial statement. The underlying significant assumptions are included in the notes that are presented as an integral part of the basic financial statement. Other information required by SFFAS #17, including the sensitivity analysis required in SFFAS #17, paragraphs 27(4) and 32(4), is presented as required supplementary information (RSI), except to the extent that the preparer elects to include some or all of that information in the notes that are an integral part of the basic financial statement.<br />Statement of Changes in Social Insurance Amounts <br />SFFAS #37 requires Federal agencies that are responsible for social insurance programs to prepare a statement of changes in social insurance amounts to present the reasons for changes during the reporting period in the open group measure reported on the statement of social insurance.<br />Preparation of the Statement of Social Insurance<br />The RRB's Bureau of the Actuary prepares the agency's statement of social insurance. The statement of social insurance is based on the periodic actuarial valuation of the assets and liabilities, also prepared by the agency's Bureau of the Actuary. The Bureau of the Actuary publishes a new actuarial valuation every three years. This triennial valuation, which is updated during each of the two interim years, supports agency reporting responsibilities under the following statutes:<br />&bull;Section 15 of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 requiring the Railroad Retirement Board, at intervals of not more than three years, to prepare actuarial valuations of the railroad retirement system;<br />&bull;Section 22 of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 requiring the Railroad Retirement Board to prepare an annual report containing a five-year projection of revenues to and payments from the Railroad Retirement Account, and to submit the report to the President and the Congress by July 1; and <br />&bull;Section 502 of the Railroad Retirement Solvency Act of 1983 requires the Railroad Retirement Board to prepare an annual report on the actuarial status of the Railroad Retirement program.<br />Actuarial Advisory Committee<br />Section 15(f) of the Railroad Retirement Act requires that the triennial valuation process include review of assumptions and methods by the agency's Actuarial Advisory Committee. The committee's statement is published with the valuation and describes the scope of their work.<br />Prior Actuarial Audits<br />The RRB has not had a full scope actuarial audit of the work of its Bureau of the Actuary.<br />The most recent limited scope audit was conducted in 1998. The scope of the engagement was limited to an assessment of the reasonableness of the estimates and key assumptions as reported in the Twentieth Actuarial Valuation of the Assets and Liabilities Under the Railroad Retirement Acts as of December 31, 1995. In the opinion of the consulting actuary, the valuation was thorough and objective, the methodology was sound and the assumptions were reasonable.<br />Basis of Estimates<br />The statement of social insurance is a comparative statement that presents data for the current and four prior years. The estimates and projections in the statement of social insurance are based on the triennial valuation of assets and liabilities of the Railroad Retirement program prepared by the RRB's Bureau of the Actuary.<br />Year For Which Estimates Will Be Reported <br />Base Actuarial Valuation Updates<br />FY 2017 Valuation Model supporting 26th Actuarial Valuation Updated for use in preparing the June 2017 Section 502 Report<br />FY 2016 Updated for use in preparing the June 2016Section 502 Report<br />FY 2015 Not Applicable.

The Government reserves the right to inspect or test any supplies or services that have been tendered for acceptance. The Government may require repair or replacement of nonconforming supplies or reperformance of nonconforming services at no increase in contract price. If repair/replacement or reperformance will not correct the defects or is not possible, the Government may seek an equitable price reduction or adequate consideration for acceptance of nonconforming supplies or services. The Government must exercise its post-acceptance rights- (1) Within a reasonable time after the defect was discovered or should have been discovered; and <br />(2) Before any substantial change occurs in the condition of the item, unless the change is due to the defect in the item. <br />(b) Assignment.

The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing as soon as it is reasonably possible after the commencement of any excusable delay, setting forth the full particulars in connection therewith, shall remedy such occurrence with all reasonable dispatch, and shall promptly give written notice to the Contracting Officer of the cessation of such occurrence. <br />(g) Invoice. <br />(1) The Contractor shall submit an original invoice and three copies (or electronic invoice, if authorized) to the address designated in the contract to receive invoices.

The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor's records.

The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the Contractor, or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government, upon request, with adequate assurances of future performance. In the event of termination for cause, the Government shall not be liable to the Contractor for any amount for supplies or services not accepted, and the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided by law. If it is determined that the Government improperly terminated this contract for default, such termination shall be deemed a termination for convenience. <br />(n) Title.

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <br />(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. <br />The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. <br />(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. <br />(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. <br />(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757. <br />I2.8 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement <br />Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items (JAN 2011)52.212-5(a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: <br />(1) 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking in Persons (Feb 2009) (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)). <br />___Alternate I (Aug 2007) of 52.222-50 (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)). <br />(2) 52.233-3, Protest After Award (AUG 1996) (31 U.S.C. 3553). <br />(3) 52.233-4, Applicable Law for Breach of Contract Claim (OCT 2004) (Pub.

<p><br />K2. Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters<br />(FAR 52.209-5 APR 2010)<br />(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -<br />(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -<br />(A) Are [ ] are not [ ] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(B) Have [ ] have not [ ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation);<br />(C) Are [ ] are not [ ] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and<br />(D) Have [ ], have not [ ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(ii) The Offeror has [ ] has not [ ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.<br />(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, <br />director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or <br />supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general <br />manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and <br />similar positions).<br />This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency <br />of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent <br />Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under <br />Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. <br />(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <br />(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.<br />(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.<br />(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<br />K3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items (JAN <br />2011) FAR 52.212-3<br />An offeror shall complete only paragraph (b) of this provision if the offeror has completed the annual representations and certifications electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor. <br />(j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly- <br />(1) o In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or <br />(2) o Outside the United States. <br />(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] <br />[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that- <br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and <br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />[ ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1).

Type of Contract (APR 1984) FAR 52.216-1<br />The Government contemplates award of a fixed price contract resulting from this solicitation.<br /><br />SECTION M EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD <br />M1. Award<br />M1.1 The following clause shall be incorporated by reference: Evaluation- <br />Commercial Items (JAN 1999) FAR 52.212-2<br />M1.2 The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, cost or price and other factors, specified elsewhere in this solicitation, considered.<br />M1.3 The Government may (i) reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest, (ii) accept other than the lowest offer, and (iii) waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.<br />M1.4 The Government may award a contract on the basis of initial offers received, without discussions. Therefore, each initial offer should contain the Offeror's best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint.<br />M1.5 A written award or acceptance of offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer, as provided in paragraph (d) above), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. Negotiations conducted after receipt of an offer do not constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the Government.<br />M1.6 Neither financial data submitted with an offer, nor representations concerning facilities or financing, will form a part of the resulting contract. However, if the resulting contract contains a clause providing for price reduction for defective cost or pricing data, the contract price will be subject to reduction if cost or pricing data furnished is incomplete, inaccurate, or not current.<br />M2. AWARD<br />The award of a contract resulting from this solicitation will be made to the responsive and responsible offeror whose proposal is considered by the OIG to provide the greatest value to the Government. The following formula will be used as a guide by the OIG in determining which offer provides the greatest benefit.<br />Total Proposal Score = (Technical Score) + (Price Score)<br />For purposes of this evaluation the relative weighing of technical factors to price factors shall be 3:1.<br />M3. PRICE PROPOSAL EVALUATION<br />The total evaluated price of an offer is the firm fixed price quoted by the Offeror for the initial contract term and all option terms. <br />Calculation of the "Price Score" will be computed by multiplying the maximum point score available by a fraction representing the ratio of the lowest total evaluated price of all technically acceptable offers received by the OIG to the total evaluated price of the offer being evaluated.<br />M4. TECHNICAL PROPOSAL EVALUATION<br />To be considered responsive to this solicitation the Offeror must meet the minimum qualifications to enter into this agreement as specified in provision number L3.<br />Offerors shall comply with the format and content instructions outlined in Section L. Offers deemed deficient in this regard may, at the OIG's discretion, be declared non-responsive to the terms of this solicitation and may be rejected.<br />Responsive proposals will be evaluated to determine the relative technical merit of each response. Technical proposals will be evaluated according to the following criteria which are listed in order of decreasing relative importance. Individual factors are listed in decreasing relative importance within each major criteria.<br />M4.1 Total Experience of Proposed Staff See L5.2<br />M4.2. Professional Education and Credentials of Proposed Staff See L5.3<br />M4.3. Total Experience of the Firm See L5.4<br />M4.4. Scope of Work Proposed See L5.5<br />a. Understanding of the subject matter of the audit.<br />b. Adherence to requirements of the Statement of Work.<br />c. A methodology that directly addresses the audit objectives as described in the Statement of Work, including data availability.<br />d. Adherence to Actuarial Standards of Practice in performance of all work and preparation of all reports.<br />e. Proposed timeframes for performance and completion of work.<br />f. Discussion of a potential problem <br />M4.5 Past Performance References See L5.6<br />M4.6 System of Quality Control See L5.7<br />M5. CALCULATION OF THE TECHNICAL SCORE<br />Calculation of the "technical score" will be computed by multiplying the maximum point score available by a fraction representing the ratio of the technical score of the proposal being evaluated to the technical score of the highest rated proposal.<br />M6. PROPOSAL EVALUATION<br />Proposals will first be reviewed for content and conformance to proposal preparation instructions. Proposals which are so deficient in these areas as not to warrant further consideration will be rejected and the Offeror will be so notified. The initial evaluation of proposals will be based on the Offeror's written response to the solicitation. Technical and price proposals will be evaluated in accordance with the criteria in this Section M. A determination of competitive range will be made and those Offerors excluded from the competitive range will be so notified.<br />M7. FINAL PROPOSAL REVISIONS<br />Written and/ or oral discussions may be conducted with those Offerors in the competitive range. Offerors, thus selected, shall be given an opportunity to submit a best and final offer. A common cut-off date shall be established for the receipt of best and final offers and for cessation of all competitive discussions.<br />M8. FINAL EVALUATION AND SELECTION<br />Final Evaluation and Contractor selection shall be made in accordance with the provisions of this Section M and shall be based on the Offeror's proposal as modified by the best and final proposal, if required.<br />M9. EVALUATION OF OPTIONS (FAR 52.217-5 JUL 1990)<br />Except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206(b) not to be in the Government's best interests, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br />M10 Progress Payments Not Included (FAR 52.232-15 APR1984)<br />A progress payments clause is not included in this solicitation, and will not be added to the resulting contract at the time of award. Bids conditioned upon inclusion of a progress payment clause in the resulting contract will be rejected as nonresponsive.</p>

A Government-owned satellite television system was installed at March ARB in 2002. Commercial DirecTV brand digital satellite receivers and programming services were also purchased at that time to go along with the base satellite system. These digital receivers are designed to receive only DirecTV programming services. No other satellite programming services are compatible with these digital satellite receivers, and it will not be cost effective to discard the functional DirecTV receivers and purchase new receivers if service is performed by a non-DirecTV vendor. DirecTV programming service is an item peculiar only to one manufacturer. DirecTV programming is currently essential to the Government's requirements, and market research indicates other products lacking the particular feature of DirecTV do not meet, or cannot be economically modified to meet, the agency's needs.<br />Deadline for submission of all quotes will be no later than March 18, 2011 at 3:00 PM PST. Proposals may be sent electronically to the following e-mail address: alma.harris@us.af.mil, or mailed to 452 MSG/LGC (FA46641040A001), ATTN: Contracting Officer, 1940 Graeber St., Bldg. 449, March ARB, CA 92518-1650 in time to meet the deadline date.

<p>CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT</p>
<p><br />52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>1) Past Performance <br />2) Price</p>
<p><strong>Past Performance is considered significantly more important than price.</strong></p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>
<p>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-2<br />BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD: This is a competitive best value source selection in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13 in which competing offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis significantly more important than price considerations. By submission of its offer in accordance with the instructions provided in clause FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors, the offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, and representations and certifications, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. This combined synopsis/solicitation will result in a Firm-fixed price contract and all offers shall be treated equally except for their prices and performance records. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />a. Price Evaluation. Initially, offers shall be ranked according to price. An offeror's proposed prices will be determined by multiplying the quantity by the contractor's proposed unit price to confirm the extended amount for each contract line item (CLIN). The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The offeror shall also fill in the total extended price for the base plus four options periods.<br /></span></strong>b. Using questionnaires, the contracting officer shall seek recent and relevant performance information based on (1) the past and present efforts provided by the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources. Relevant performance includes performances of animal care and husbandry services as those defined in the PWS with the same or similar scope, magnitude, and complexity this solicitation requires. The government reserves the right to seek information on higher priced offers if none of the lower priced offerors receives a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment rating. The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the effort described in the solicitation, based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance. <br />c. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of Substantial Confidence, Satisfactory Confidence, Limited Confidence, No Confidence or Unknown Confidence as defined in AFFARS Mandatory Procedures 5315.3, Table 3 and shown below. Offerors with no relevant or recent past or present performance history shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence," meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. Confidence ratings are defined as follows:<br />SUBSTANTIAL CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />SATISFACTORY CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has an expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />LIMITIED CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />NO CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.<br />UNKNOWN CONFIDENCE: No performance record is identifiable or the offeror's performance record is limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.<br />d. Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will not be considered as highly as past performance information from the principal offeror. Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history or the offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence," meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. If the prime contractor has no past performance and is relying on their subcontractor's past performance, the prime contractor will be assessed an unknown confidence rating and, depending on the past performance information on the subcontractor, their past performance may or may not be assessed as defined in AFFARS Mandatory Procedures 5315.3, Table 3 (shown above) and the two ratings will be combined. <br />e. A relevancy determination of the offeror's present and past performance, including joint ventures, subcontractors and/or teaming partners will be made. In determining relevance for individual contract, consideration will be given to the effort, or portion of the effort, being proposed by the offeror, teaming partner, or subcontractor whose contract is being reviewed and evaluated. Relevance will be assessed for contracts that are most similar to the effort, or portion of the effort, for which that contractor is being proposed, and may contribute to an overall higher relevancy determination for the offeror. The Government is not bound by the offeror's opinion of relevance. <br />f. In evaluating past performance, the government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />g. All conforming quotes will be ranked by overall price, low to high. Offers past performance will be reviewed in order, starting with the lowest overall price. If the lowest overall priced offer is judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance rating that offer represents the best value for the Government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.<br />h. If the lowest priced offeror is not judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the next lowest priced offeror will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by overall price) until an offeror is judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment or until all offerors are evaluated. In that event, the Source Selection Authority shall make an integrated assessment best value award decision.<br />i. <strong>Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in the quotes preparation instructions.</strong> Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their quote or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Adverse past performance is defined as past performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors would not constitute discussions and the contracting officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for quote revision.<br />j. The government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors. The government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format found in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested, and a seperate written solicitation will not be issued.
The solicitation number for this request is F11PS00463 and the solicitation is issued as a request for quote (FRQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those is effect through the current Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC 2005-48).
This is a small-business set-aside procurement under NAICS classification code: 541360 and PSC code: T006.  The small business size standard is $4.5.
BACKGROUND: Wildlife managers routinely conduct aerial surveys of waterfowl as a means of tracking population size and trend. Correct identification of species is critical to most surveys.  All aerial observers struggle with waterfowl identification to some degree, and new inexperienced observers are continually entering the work force.  To date, no comprehensive guide to waterfowl identification has been developed specifically for aerial observers.  
We intend to create a multi-media guide to improve aerial waterfowl identification, survey training, and standardize protocols.  The guide focuses specifically on aerial surveys with a "top-down" perspective of birds and will include all North American waterfowl and some waterbirds that are routinely encountered during aerial surveys (e.g., coots, loons, murres, grebes, cormorants).  The intended audience is professional wildlife biologists and other aerial observers, including those associated with private conservation organizations, and environmental consultants.
The goal of the project is to develop a user-friendly training manual and identification guide to standardize and enhance observer training and improve waterfowl identification and counting from the air.   The Guide will ultimately have two parts:  a Handbook:  a 6 x 9 inch sturdy, spiral bound handbook for in-flight use, and a DVD for on-the-ground training and reference.   
The DVD will use high-definition video clips to aid in species identification and training.  For each species, we will include the following video sequence:a. Aerial video of a bird on the water (narrator points out key characteristics, particularly for the male ducks, highlighted with arrows/circles; includes both close-up and distant perspectives)  b. Aerial video of birds flushing (narrator points out how it jumps, or skitters, or dives )c. Aerial video of birds in flight - slow motion (narrator points out the key characteristics to look for during flight, complemented with arrows)d. Aerial video of birds in flight - normal speed (narrator points out rapidity of wingbeat, how erratic the flight is, how close to the water they fly, etc.)e. Aerial video of birds landing (some species have distinctive landing patterns, such as apparent "crash-landing")
Examples of previous video products for this project can be downloaded then viewed at http://www.fws.gov/filedownloads/ftp_Doug_Canfield_Videos/Waterfowl/ 
The USFWS, Alaska region (headquartered in Anchorage) is leading this effort and seeks a contractor that will provide high definition aerial videography for a variety of bird species.  Several shooting locations in North America will be required to obtain adequate footage for all target species.  Central Florida is one location that harbors three species of waterfowl that are unlikely to be found together elsewhere in the U.S, thus central Florida is a relatively efficient area for obtaining video footage for these species.  The highest priority target species for this job are Mottled Ducks, Fulvous Whistling Duck, and Black-bellied Whistling Duck.  These species are routinely encountered in close proximity to one another in the vicinity of Clewiston, Florida area during April. 
The location for this project will be in Clewiston, Florida and vicinity.  Clewiston, Florida, is a full service community with nearby airports at West Palm Beach, North Country, and Airglades. 
STATEMENT OF WORK: The Contractor will meet all of the following requirements:
1. Procure and make all arrangements for helicopter services.  Maximum flight hours will be FIVE, not counting ferry time to and from the Clewiston airport (Airglades airport).  Helicopter services must meet all legal requirements.  Flights may be over water or marsh.2. Fuel costs should be included in the price for helicopter services.  3. Helicopter must be able to accommodate the videographer and all necessary video equipment as well as an additional observer (ideally front seat) who will help direct the pilot and camera operator to target birds, identify bird species, and confirm that the video footage is appropriate for meeting the scope of work as outlined in this RFP.  The additional observer will require a separate monitor as well as a helmet-compatible intercom system to communicate with the videographer and pilot (observer will have his own helmet with intercom connection).  The additional observer will be an employee of Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. 4. Contractor shall employ the use of a gyro-stabilized camera platform with a high definition lens with minimal power of 42x9.5mm plus a lens doubler.  The camera platform shall be a Flir, Cineflex or equivalent controllable, color, high definition (HD), 1080 resolution, progressive, gyro-stabilized system with a recorder capturing 1080 progressive 59.94 frames per second.5. The footage shall be captured at a resolution of not less than 1920 x1080 progressive frames, and all raw footage (60 frames per second) obtained while filming shall be delivered to the Service project manager on a portable hard drive at full resolution no later than May 15, 2011.6. Contractor shall have prior experience or demonstrated ability to capture clear and smooth (i.e., follow focus) video of small moving targets (such as moving wildlife).  Examples of previous video products for this project can be viewed at http://www.fws.gov/filedownloads/ftp_Doug_Canfield_Videos/Waterfowl/7. The contractor shall license the material in perpetuity to the USFWS for use in training video programs about wildlife.  A web version of the training video will also be produced by USFWS and the rights to videographic material contained in the web version will remain licensed to the USFWS in perpetuity.   The contractor will retain all other rights to the material recorded for commercial purposes.  8. Contractor shall be responsible for the acquisition and operating cost of all camera equipment, helicopter service including fuel, transportation to and from Clewiston, Florida, lodging and per diem costs (if necessary), tapes, footage transferring, hard drives and shipping to the USFWS project manager. 9. Dates of videography flight are flexible, but should occur on a weekday between April 14 and April 29, 2011.  The observer, Ron Bielefeld, will be available on any weekday with a 24-hour advance notice (Ron's alternate phone: 772-388-9880).   Weather conditions must be appropriate for this shoot.  Flights will only be conducted when wind speeds are less than 15 mph, skies are bright overcast or sunny, and there is no fog or precipitation that would obscure the camera lens and compromise the quality of the video footage.   Flight altitude will vary from about 100-500 ft agl. 10. Contractor will meet via phone with the USFWS project manager and observer no later than 1 April to discuss protocols, in-flight procedures, equipment needs, logistical arrangements, and schedules.

<p>Technical capability, and past performance, when combined, shall be approximately equal in importance to price. If Technical Capability, and Past Performance are equivalent, price shall be the determining factor.</p>
<p>Technical Capability:</p>
<p>Evaluation of Technical Capability will be based on the information provided in the quotation. NIST will evaluate whether the offeror has demonstrated that its proposed equipment meets or exceeds all minimum requirements. Quotations that do not demonstrate the proposed equipment meets all requirements will not be considered further for award. If an offeror does not indicate whether its proposed equipment meets a certain minimum requirement, NIST will determine that it does not.</p>
<p>Past Performance:</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the offeror's past performance information and, if appropriate, its proposed subcontractors' past performance to determine its relevance to the current requirement and the extent to which it demonstrates that the offeror has successfully completed relevant contracts in the past five years. In assessing the offeror's past performance information, NIST will evaluate the quality, timeliness, and ability to control cost and schedule of the past work. Evaluation of this factor will be based on information contained in the technical portion of the quotation and information provided by references. The Government will evaluate past performance information by contacting appropriate references, including NIST references, if applicable. The Government may also consider other available information in evaluating the offeror's past performance. The Government will assign a neutral rating if the offeror has no relevant past performance information.</p>

In order to register with CCR and to be eligible to receive an award, all offerors must have a Dun &amp; Bradstreet number, which may be acquired free of charge by contacting Dun &amp; Bradstreet on line at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or by phone at 1-866-705-5711. The government encourages all contractors to submit their Representations and Certifications on-line Business Partner Network (BPN) at https://orca.bpn.gov. The BPN is the single source for vendor data for the federal government. Award will not be made to any contractor that is not registered in CCR.
<p><br />Brand Name Justification: The National Weather Service Central Region has 34 offices located throughout 14 states that utilize Liebert brand HVAC systems designed for Data Center applications. In excess of $250,000 has been invested in interfacing this brand unit to existing control systems, including the retrofit of Automated Logic which required a specially designed interface. These systems are unique in their physical size and offer down-flow supply for raised floor equipment without any necessary building modification. Building modifications required for large alternative brands could jeopardize configuration control of the facility and double the cost of installation. Configuration control of all remote office data centers is paramount in being able to maintain and repair equipment. By introducing alternate manufacturer's equipment, an estimated $10,000 in localized additional training for operation, maintenance, and repair would be required for each subsequent brand introduced at each location. Existing preventative maintenance contracts were awarded based on a requirement for Liebert certified technicians, which would have to be re-competed for any alternate brand selected. Brand integrity, system performance, equipment consistency, and limited space all remain factors.</p>

The contractor shall perform AIR at the labor billing rates designated in the Schedule, as described in paragraph (c) of this clause. The AIR handling fee designated in the Schedule shall be the sole fee used for direct material purchases and subcontractor handling. The estimated quantity of labor hours and handling fees represent the Government's best estimate for growth that may be required throughout the contract performance period. All growth work shall be paid at the prices stated in the Schedule.</p>
<p>(b) The contractor shall take into account the potential for ordering all estimated AIR quantities in developing the Production Schedule. The ordering of any portion of the AIR quantities does not in itself warrant an extension to the original contract completion date; however, for planning purposes, the Government anticipates ordering AIR in accordance with the following schedule: <br />(1) No more than 75% of the hours during the first half of the contract period of performance. <br />(2) No more than 50% of the hours during the third quarter of the contract period of performance. <br />(3) No more than 30% of the hours during the fourth quarter of the contract period of performance.</p>
<p>(c) The AIR labor rate shall be a flat, hourly rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include: <br />(1) Direct production labor hour functions only. Direct production labor hours are hours of skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in direct production. Direct production is defined as work performed by a qualified craftsman that is directly related to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. The following functions are identified as direct production: Abrasive Cleaning/Water Blasting, Tank Cleaning, Welding, Burning, Brazing, Blacksmithing, Machining (inside and outside), Carpentry, Electrical/Electronic Work, Crane Operation, Shipfitting, Lagging/Insulating, Painting, Boilermaking, Pipe Fitting, Engineering (Production), Sheetmetal Work, Staging/Scaffolding, and Rigging. <br />(2) Non-production labor hours (whether charged directly or indirectly by contractor's accounting system) shall be for labor in support of production functions. For purposes of this clause, support functions are defined as functions that do not directly contribute to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production labor hours. Examples of support functions include: Testing, Quality Assurance (inspection), Engineering (support), Planning (including involvement of craft foreman/journeyman in planning a task), Estimating (including determination of necessary materials and equipment needed to perform a task), Material Handling, Set-up (moving tools and equipment from shop to ship to perform a task), Fire Watch, General Labor (including general support of journeyman tasks), Cleaning (including debris pickup and removal), Surveying, Security, Transportation, Supervision, and Lofting (sail/pattern making).</p>
<p>(d) Additional Item Requirements do not include replacement work performed pursuant to the Inspection and Manner of Doing Work or Guarantees clauses.</p>
<p>(e) It is the Government's intention to award any growth work identified during the repair to the contractor, if a fair and reasonable price can be negotiated for such work, based upon Schedule rates. If a fair and reasonable price cannot be negotiated, the Government may, at its discretion, obtain services outside of the contract. Such services may be performed while the ship is undergoing repair in the contractor's facility pursuant to the Access to Vessels clause.</p>
<p>(f) The contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer the following information in all AIR proposals: <br />(1) Number of labor hours estimated; broken down by specific direct production labor category.<br />(2) Material estimates, individually broken out and priced. When requested by the Contracting Officer, material quotes shall be provided. <br />(3) Subcontractor estimates, individually broken out and priced along with the actual subcontractor quotes. The requirement to submit subcontractor quotes may be waived if deemed appropriate by the Contracting Officer. <br />(4) Material/subcontractor handling fee and the basis for the fee.</p>
<p>(g) The contractor shall not be entitled to payment for any hours ordered pursuant to this clause until such time as a written contract modification is executed.<br />(End of clause)</p>

<p>STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES</p>
<p>REPORT PROVIDING RECOMMENDATIONS ON A POTENTIAL REVISION OF 10 CFR 190</p>
<p><br />PROJECT OFFICER:</p>
<p>Brian Littleton<br />202- 343-9216</p>
<p>PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:</p>
<p>Date of award through September 30, 2012</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Radiation Protection Division, is interested in identifying options and issues as it looks at potentially revising 40 CFR Part 190. For this action, we are specifically interested in potential changes to 40 CFR Part 190.10(b). As we potentially move to a new phase of nuclear power in the 21st century, the Agency wants to better understand if the current 33 year old standards are relevant, environmentally protective and enforceable. Because Section 190.10(b) addresses issues that would affect spent nuclear fuel reprocessing, any changes to this section would be controversial. If EPA were to change this section, our goal would be for it to be environmentally protective. EPA has nost taken a position on the issue of reprocessing, however, it is a possibility for which EPA's regulations need to adequately account.</p>
<p>PURPOSE:</p>
<p>The primary goal of this work would be for a nationally recognized group to develop a document which will provide technical recommendation to EPA on a targeted technical issues to be addressed in a potential revision of 40 CFR 190.10(b) The recommendations provided in the document would be focused on issues, such as the use of collective dose, impacting the "radionuclide cap" aspect of its regulation as stated in 40 CFR Part 190.10(b).</p>
<p>The proposed work would help identify key issues and suggest technical options for protecting human health and the environment from radiation releases for nuclear power operations. These technical options will need to address what would need to be considered by the Agency if it were to follow any particular option related to 40 CFR Part 190.10(b). The document will bring up specific topics in a systematic manner and receive input from technical experts on each issue. When possible, consensus regarding an issue will be noted. However, consensus of several of these issues may not be possible. If this is the case, then the goal of the document will be to provide various approaches that the Agency could take with regards to an issue, and discuss the technical strengths and weaknesses of each approach. This document will be published by the contactor in an appropriate format (formal Proceedings, Commentary, Report, etc.)</p>
<p>PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVE:</p>
<p>The Agency is seeking expert consultation from qualified scientists and experts in radiation matters. Merit shall be given to quotes which include consultation of experts such as past and/or present members of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Council or Radiation Protection and measurement, the Agency's Science Advisory Board, and/or other recognized independent technical advisory organizations.</p>
<p>DELIVERABLES</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide the following support: convene a group of technical experts for the purpose of soliciting opinions and recommendations regarding manners to protect the public from exposure to radiation resulting from nuclear energy operations covered by 40 CFR Part 190.10(b), which will focus on 10(b). The contractor shall propose the manner with which it will fulfill this criteria (ie How will information be obtained from each expert: How will consensus be sought and what criteria will be used to determine consensus; In what manner will the findings be published, etc). The quote shall address proposed personnel and the manner for publishing the findings.</p>
<p>Specific topics to be addressed in the final documentation include the following:</p>
<p>1. Radionuclide Inventory - Are the suite of radionuclide's specified in the existing standard (kr-85, I-129 and Pu-239 and other alpha-emitting TRU) those radionuclide's of highest concern? Should some radionuclide's be eliminated from the regulated list? Should some radionuclide's be added to the current list?</p>
<p>2. Strengths and weaknesses of current approach - Are the original objectives of the Agency's standard still reasonable? Is the concept of environmental dose commitment a desirable endpoint? Should any regulatory action continue to use an endpoint, local, regional, national, and worldwide populations? How has it worked in the 33 years of the regulations? Is it appropriate to consider the following three points of view 1) the potential public health impact attributable to each radioactive material, 2) the combined potential public health impact of various components of the fuel cycle, 3) the integrated public health impact of the entire fuel cycle due to projected future growth?</p>
<p>3. Alternate Approaches - Given the information collected in the previous tasks, what are the potential alternative options that the Agency could use in revising 190.10(b), and what are the issues, and technical strengths, and weaknesses associated with those options. For example, would a combination of approaches be appropriate, such as maintaining a cap based on collective dose considerations, while establishing a facility based limit as well? Would the existing standard be more practicable (e.g., enforceable, protective) on a facility by facility basis? The Agency understands that cost information may be difficult to obtain, however, the Agency would like to understand the different options' their relative costs so that the Agency could understand if a particular approach is so costly it would not be attempted.</p>
<p><br />The deliverables for this work assignment shall be:</p>
<p>1. A draft consultation report which summarizes the communications of the technical workgroup. The report will note any consensus recommendations that resulted from the communications and any major issues where differences were noted.</p>
<p>2. A final consultation report which clarifies any questions that the EPA Project Officer may have regarding issues covered in the report.</p>
<p><br />SCHEDULE AND DELIVERABLES</p>
<p>TASK NO: DELIVERABLE DUE DATE<br />Task 1: Draft Consultation/Report Within 12 Months of Contract Award<br />Task 2: Final Consultation/Report Within 15 Months of Contract Award</p>

3. Description of the Supplies, Services:

4. Authority: Only one responsible source is deemed reasonably available and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  41USC 253(c1).	5.  Describe how the contractor?s unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited:This new auto sampler will be used to analyze for Methane, Ethane and Ethene by Methods RSK-175 and EPAC3.  Our sample requests for this type of analysis has been increasing and finding an outside agency lab to do the work has been difficult.  This new auto sampler will allow us to bring a new capability to our laboratory as well as keeping the excising analysis for Alcohols. By repurposing the Agilent 6890 GC dual FID instrument running ChemStation software we can keep up with the increasing analytical workload in the Methane, Ethane and Ethene area. Gerstel?s software Maestro is fully integrated with the Agilent?s ChemStation which will allow for prepping ahead of samples. This means that one sample can be conditioned and ready for injection while another sample is running. This feature of the software is very important for processing a large number of projected samples, by greatly reducing the sample preparation and run time. Gerstel?s software Maestro is the only auto sam pler software out there that allows this feature. This combination with the auto sampler will increase efficiency. Another advantage with the Maestro software is the automated liquid handling which enables easy programming without, dilutions, internal standards and having to use complex programming to handle derivatizations. 
The dual FID GC is currently used for Alcohol analysis. With the addition of this type of auto sampler we will retain our ability to analyze for alcohols plus add the ability to do headspace analysis of Methane, Ethane and Ethene samples. By purchasing another style of headspace auto sampler we would lose the ability to use the dual FID GC for Alcohol analysis. Purchasing this auto sample saves the government money by allowing dual use of the FID GC. If we purchased a different style auto sampler we would also need to purchase another dual FID GC. The purchase of a different head space auto sampler from other vendors does not represent the best value for the government.
In summary, purchasing the Gerstel auto sampler will have the most significant impact on productivity and efficiency for our lab, which therefore represents the best value for the government.

6. Describe the efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as practicable:
There are several that are designed to inject the head space for a vial, but the Gerstel allows the lab to keep the ability to inject liquid samples which is needed for the Alcohol analysis. Several auto samplers were reviewed to determine compatibility with existing equipment and to see if they met the Government?s minimum need, but it was determined that they do not allow for prepping samples ahead of time in their software; which would slow the analytical throughput for this analysis down considerably.	 
7.  Description of the market research conducted (see FAR Part 10).  
No market research was compiled due to the special nature of the task that this equipment is intended to do.  Explanation is given in question number 6.

8.  Other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition.
The Gerstel sales and services office is located in Maryland very close to our lab so repair calls should be quick.  Gerstel also has 24/7 help lines for any software/hardware issues free of charge, even after the warranty period has expired. Extended service contracts or per call services are available if needed.  	9.  List sources that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.  If no sources expressed an interest in writing, indicate such.  
No sources have expressed an interest in writing.

<p>The US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) enforces the Federal laws prohibiting job discrimination in both the private and federal sectors--Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, as amended, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA), The Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008, the Equal Pay Act, Title I and Title V of the Americans with Disabilities Act, Section 501 and 505 of the Rehabilitation Act, and the Civil Rights Act of 1991. EEOC also provides oversight and coordination of all Federal equal employment opportunity regulations, practices and policies.</p>
<p>The EEOC - Revolving Fund Division (RFD) was created to broaden the EEOC's education, outreach and technical assistance programs by providing fee-based programs to EEOC stakeholder groups. The RFD (d.b.a The EEOC Training Institute), hereinafter referred to as the INSTITUTE, generates its revenue from the fee-based products and services offered to Federal, State, and Local government and Private employers and employees. The INSTITUTE offers a wide range of products and services to include seminars, webinars, courses and conferences and on-site customer-specific training programs.</p>
<p>KINSAIL Corporation is the service provider for the INSTITUTE's Payment and Registration System. EQUINIX is KINSAIL's data provider. In addition, EQUINIX is the data provider for the Agency's financial system (Momentum). EQUINIX has a valid SAS 70 Type 2 audit, KINSAIL does not have a valid SAS 70 Type 2 audit. Therefore, the audit will be limited to KINSAIL Corporation operations as it relates to the INSTITUTE's payment and registration system.</p>
<p>II. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The INSTITUTE has a requirement for a contractor to conduct a Statement of Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE-16) Type I audit on KINSAIL Corporation's internal controls of the INSTITUTE's Payment and Registration System and to provide the INSTITUTE with a copy of the SSAE-16 report. The Agency is seeking this report for one base year and 2 one year option periods.</p>
<p>The INSTITUTE is required to monitor and control all financial transactions and to ensure that the funds received by the INSTITUTE reconcile with both U.S. Treasury and the EEOC's financial system. In addition, the INSTITUTE is required to monitor controls of systems and procedures for handling personal information and to ensure that this information is properly safeguarded.</p>
<p>KINSAIL is responsible for all payments and registration forms for EEOC training events. KINSAIL receives payment and registration documents from attendees by fax, mail or electronically via the INSTITUTE website. The INSTITUTE accepts payments by check, credit card, or purchase order. Purchase orders are only accepted from Federal, State or Local government agencies.</p>
<p>The SSAE-16 Type I report needs to focus on KINSAIL's internal control systems related to the processing of both on-line and paper registration forms and payments received by mail, fax and/or phone and KINSAIL's system related to the invoice of purchase orders which was described above.</p>
<p><br /><br />III. PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The SSAE-16 Type I Report is used to fulfill the EEOC's OMB A-123/FMFIA requirements to assess the adequacy of KINSAIL's internal controls and to meet the requirements of EEOC's annual financial statement audit. The annual audit requires a report prepared under the professional standards of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) SSAE-16 Type I report for KINSAIL which, as previously stated, is a service provider to the INSTITUTE at the EEOC. This SSAE-16 Type I report is considered an integral and necessary part of the EEOC's annual financial statement audit.</p>
<p>IV. SCOPE OF WORK</p>
<p>Contractor will perform a SSAE-16 Type I audit to assess the adequacy of the internal controls of KINSAIL, LLC as it relates to the EEOC's RFD program and operation. In addition, the contractor will provide a copy of the audit report to EEOC which includes an auditor's opinion on the internal controls as they relate to the control objectives relevant to the services provided by KINSAIL. EQUINIX is KINSAIL's data provider under this contract and EQUINIX is also the data provider for the EEOC Momentum system administered by National Business Center/Department of Interior (NBC/DOI). EQUINIX has a current SAS70 Type II audit; therefore the scope of this SSAE-16 Type I audit shall be limited to KINSAIL's operations using the carve-out clause within the SSAE guidelines.</p>
<p>This work shall be performed in strict compliance with all rules and regulations of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) rules and standards established by Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagement (SSAE) 16, for a Type I report. The lead auditor must be a Certified Public Accountant (CPA). A SSAE-16 Type I report provides an opinion of the internal controls as they relate to the control objectives relevant to the services provided by a third party vendor (KINSAIL). A SSAE-16 Type I report determines whether such controls were placed in operation as of a specified date in time and would be acceptable for use in the Fiscal Year requested.</p>
<p>The Type I Report is made up of 3 major areas, per the SSAE No. 16 Guidance:</p>
<p>A. A description of the service organization's system prepared by KINSAIL (the service organization being audited). KINSAIL will need to prepare a description of the control objectives that are in place and being tested at their organization, as it relates to the process that is being reviewed for use by the INSTITUTE. This will describe the process and how the control objectives tie in to each other and the process as a whole, giving the INSTITUTE an overview of what and how, at a high level, their data will be handled.</p>
<p>B. A written assertion by KINSAIL's management about whether, in all material respects, and based on suitable criteria:<br /><br />1. The description of the service organization's system fairly presents the service organization's system that was designed and implemented as of a specified date.<br /><br />2. The controls related to the control objectives stated in the description were suitably designed to achieve those control objectives as of the specified date.</p>
<p>KINSAIL's Management will need to prepare a written assertion attesting to the fair presentation and design of controls.</p>
<p>C. A service auditor's report that expresses an opinion on the matters in B1and B2.<br /><br />1. The contractor performing the testing will need to review KINSAIL's assessment of the design of controls and attest to the validity of KINSAIL's opinion. The auditors will examine the control objectives and control activities in place at KINSAIL's office and verify they are, in fact, designed as KINSAIL noted. This is where the auditors will obtain a representative sample (per Generally Accepted Auditing Standards) of control activities and objectives to support each control activity and express the result of their testing.</p>
<p>2. The reports must provide the auditor's assessment concerning the controls systems at KINSAIL that affect the security, availability, and processing integrity of the KINSAIL system to process users' data and the confidentiality and privacy of the information processed by the service organization. This includes:<br /><br />o The processing of financial data which would include but not be limited to cash, checks, credit cards, and government purchase orders.<br /><br />o The handling and safe-guarding all financial and personal information on Training Institute attendees.</p>
<p>The SSAE-16 Type I Report must be provided to the EEOC each Fiscal Year (FY) no later than (NLT) June 30th . It will cover the current Federal Fiscal Year.</p>
<p>V. WORK TO BE PERFORMED:</p>
<p>A. Pre-Audit Field Work includes:</p>
<p>- The contractor sends the auditee (KINSAIL) auditor a Prepared by Client (PBC) list, according to the established&nbsp;Generally Accepted Auditing Standards&nbsp; (GAAS), which consists of documents and other deliverables that must be prepared prior to commencement of the SSAE-16 Type I fieldwork that will be valid for the current fiscal year of the Federal Government.</p>
<p>- The contractor conducts field work according to standards established by Auditing Standards Board (ASB) and holds an in-depth meeting with the KINSAIL (the service organization being audited) to discuss findings.</p>
<p>- Preparation of the initial draft report begins, with collaborative effort from KINSAIL, ultimately leading to the generation of final SSAE-16 Type I Service Auditor's report.</p>
<p>- Final closing meeting between contractor, and EEOC to discuss final SSAE-16 Service Auditor's Report.&nbsp;<br /><br />- &nbsp;Additionally, the report must be able to cover the requirements for the EEOC annual audit for SSAE-16 reports for the Fiscal Year.<br /><br />B. The audit report must include the following components:</p>
<p>- Section One - Independent Service Auditor's Report (a.k.a. The Auditor's Opinion Letter).</p>
<p>- Section Two - The service organization's description of controls, including a description of the service organization and its services. This section also includes a description of the control environment, risk assessment process, general and application controls, monitoring procedures and information and communication systems overview. User control considerations are also inserted into the description of controls in order that user organizations are aware of controls for which they are responsible as a user of the service.</p>
<p>- The SSAE-16 requires the service auditor to assess whether management of KINSAIL&nbsp;has used suitable criteria in:</p>
<p>&bull; Preparing the description of the service organization's system. In making this assessment, the service auditor should determine if the criteria includes, at a minimum, management's description of the service organization's system;</p>
<p>&bull; Presents how the service organization's system was designed and implemented, including (if applicable): (1) the types of services provided; (2) the classes of transactions processed; (3) the procedures within both automated and manual systems by which services are provided and by which transactions are initiated, authorized, recorded, processed, corrected (as necessary), and transferred to the reports and other information prepared for user entities; (4) the related accounting records and supporting information involved in initiating, authorizing, recording, processing, and reporting transactions; (5) how the service organization's system captures and addresses significant events and conditions (other than transactions); (6) the process used to prepare reports and other information for user entities; (7) the specified control objectives and controls designed to achieve those objectives, including complementary user entity controls contemplated in the design of the service organization's controls; and (8) other aspects of the service organization's control environment, risk assessment process, information and communication systems, control activities, and monitoring controls that are relevant to the services provided. <br /><br />&bull; Includes relevant details of changes to the service organization's system during the period covered by the description (as in&nbsp;the case of a type 2 report); and does not omit or distort information relevant to the service organization's system, while acknowledging that the description of the service organization's system is prepared to meet the common needs of a broad range of user entities and their auditors.</p>
<p>&bull; Evaluates whether controls were suitably designed to achieve the control objectives stated in management's description. In making this assessment, the service auditor should determine if the criteria include, at a minimum, whether Kinsail has identified the risks that threaten the achievement of the control objectives stated in its description of the service organization's system; and identifies&nbsp;controls that would, if operating as described, provide reasonable assurance that those risks would not prevent the control objectives stated in the description from being achieved.</p>
<p>- Section Three - Other information provided by management of the service organization, such as management's response to testing exceptions. This unaudited section of the report is optional and does not appear in all reports.</p>
<p>C. The SSAE-16 Type 1 Report must provide an independent auditor's opinion on KINSAIL's control systems based on the requirements of the SSAE. The report must provide a description of KINSAIL's control environment including the control objectives and processes currently implemented by KINSAIL. In addition, the auditor's report must include recommendations on controls and processes for future implementation.</p>
<p>VI. KEY PERSONNEL</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide a qualified person who will be designated as key to perform all requirements specified within this RFQ. The lead auditor must be a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) with experience auditing Federal government agencies or Federal government contractors.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman:. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D.

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions. The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs), the United Nations agencies and to partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations and donors for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations with a focus on disaster risk reduction. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>To fulfill its mandate to effectively respond to disasters worldwide, OFDA has established six permanent regional offices in the following locations: Budapest, Hungary; San Jose, Costa Rica; Nairobi, Kenya; Dakar, Senegal; Pretoria, South Africa; and Bangkok, Thailand. The sub-regional offices are in Almaty, Kazakhstan and in Cairo, Egypt.</p>
<p>The regional offices are headed by Principal Regional Advisors (PRAs) who report to the Disaster Response Team Leader in Washington. PRAs serve as the regional team leader for all response, preparedness and disaster risk reduction activities. They primarily serve as the key interlocutor with embassies and missions in the event of a disaster but may also serve as the Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) leader if needed. They are principally responsible for managing the regional offices, monitoring all grants on humanitarian assistance program implementation, overseeing the sub-regional offices, as appropriate, supervising the office staff, and developing, in consultation with their respective Washington-based Regional Coordinators , the multi-year non-response program strategies for the their respective regions. The PRAs coordinate with OFDA/Washington on disaster response activities, determine program priorities, and identify and formulate disaster preparedness, mitigation and training programs for their respective regions. The Regional Advisors (RAs) reporting to the PRAs ensure that OFDA's objectives for disaster response and assistance, strategic reporting and analysis are met. The RAs are responsible for monitoring and reporting on OFDA-funded programs and activities, and formulating disaster response, preparedness, mitigation and training programs for the region.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>OFDA requires the services of a Regional Advisor to be based in Pretoria, South Africa.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>This RA position requires an individual who is able to travel outside of the country where they are based, on short notice for two to three weeks at a time, or longer, on occasion. The incumbent will serve as the primary contact and liaison for on-going disaster activities related to disaster response, preparedness, mitigation and training programs. The incumbent will work to increase the capability of host governments, international organizations (IOs), and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to respond and prepare for disasters in the affected region. The RA will be responsible for disaster analysis, program monitoring, overseeing NGO partner implementation, reporting to OFDA Washington, and liaising with USAID Missions and U.S. Embassies.</p>
<p>A) Disaster Response - Working directly under the guidance and supervision of the respective PRA, the incumbent will:</p>
<p>&bull; Travel to the scene of a disaster or potential disaster and assist in initial assessments of damages and needs; determine appropriate relief assistance and emergency interventions, in consultation with OFDA/Washington and/or the PRA; and provide timely reporting cables and other written analysis of these events;<br />&bull; Coordinate and liaise with representatives of host governments, donor governments, IOs, NGOs, U.S. Embassies, and USAID Missions to facilitate cooperation and coordination in disaster response activities;<br />&bull; Monitor DCHA/OFDA-funded activities and report in accordance with OFDA guidelines, policies, and requirements;<br />&bull; Become certified and serve as an Agreement Officer's Technical Representative and Contracting Officer's Technical Representative for grants, cooperative agreements and contracts;<br />&bull; Serve as required as DART Team Leader or as a DART team member during a disaster response;<br />&bull; Maintain regular communications with the regional (and/or sub-regional) office in their area of responsibility and with OFDA/Washington;<br />&bull; Prepare specific requested field information and subject reports, as required by OFDA/Washington.<br /><br />B) Disaster Preparedness - Working closely with OFDA/Washington and drawing on the skills and technical expertise within the office and available through inter- and intra-agency agreements, the incumbent will assist representatives of host government organizations, IOs, and NGOs in the development of strong emergency and disaster preparedness/mitigation programs.</p>
<p>Specifically, the incumbent, in collaboration with OFDA regional/sub-regional team colleagues, will:</p>
<p>&bull; Assist with the design, development, and implementation of strategies and integrated disaster assistance and response for OFDA, local governments, and other donors/organizations as appropriate;<br />&bull; Advise regional officials, including host country authorities and other USAID and/or U.S. Embassy officials on OFDA's efforts in disaster response and management;<br />&bull; Provide support for other OFDA initiatives in the assigned region as identified by the incumbent's respective Regional Office and/or sub-regional team. Support may include but is not limited to assessment/evaluation visits, project design exercises and hazards/vulnerability/risk analysis;<br />&bull; Coordinate with other agencies/organizations to identify critical disaster concerns affecting the region and countries and develop projects/activities for addressing these;<br />&bull; Work with representatives of local and regional institutions and private/public sector organizations to incorporate preparedness and mitigation into appropriate programs;<br />&bull; Prepare regular strategic and analytical reports on current or anticipated emergencies, as well as comprehensive preparedness documentation on assigned countries.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The RA will report directly to the PRA. However, for certain activities, the RA will coordinate tasks with the respective Regional Coordinator in OFDA/Washington.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />Supervisory controls will be minimal. The PRA will provide direction in terms of broadly defined program goals and objectives. The RA is expected to act independently with little direction and will have wide latitude for the exercise of independent judgment.</p>

<p>The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands. During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC>*** 10 March 2011 ***
<p>Additional questions and responses about the purchase description.</p>
<p>Question: Section 4.10 indicates only Insulated 5-way binding posts. As this is mostly an AC type system, BNC connections are the primary means of connection.</p>
<p>Response: 4.10 just says that it is desirable to have these type of connections. BNC connections are fine.</p>
<p>Question: Section 5.6 states that the software should have progress indicators and a pause and resume function. Since this is a single test type instrument, there is no sequencing of programs or tests. The measurement can be stopped and started easily using the start/stop button. In the context of this PD these features would not be relevant.</p>
<p>Response: 5.6 assumes that measurements will take a long period of time and if that is the case, we would like to have the capability to pause and start the tests.</p>
<p>Question: The 110KV power source will require 220VAC 60 Hz and not 120V. can you add this power?</p>
<p>Response: Paragraph 4.3 of the PD indicates that the contractor needs to identify any<br />special power requirements in their offer so that the AFPSL can have Boeing<br />install them before the system arrives.</p>
<p>So yes, if they require 220VAC 60Hz will have it installed by the time the<br />system is delivered. They just need to identify it in their response to the<br />PD.</p>

<DESC>Amendment A002<br />Solicitation number SB1341-11-RQ-0130
<p>The purpose of this amendment is to provide a response to a question received, and to amend the PWS and the Instructions and Evaluations section of the solicitation. Below is a question that was received, with its response.<br /><br />Question 1: The solicitation states the resumes should be submitted as part of Volume 1. Is it acceptable to give a synopsis of the resumes in Volume 1 and include the actual resumes as an attachment? The narrative of the proposal will be broken up, if I include the resumes in the body of the document.<br /><br />Response 1: Yes, it is acceptable to include the actual resumes as an attachment to Volume I.</p>
<p>The PWS and Instructions and Evaluations have been revised to incorporate the following change: In the original PWS, in section III, Phase II, it was stated that the NIST TIC would select the 2 contractor personnel to work the Pilot Information Extraction task. This is modified to show that the contractor shall propose the 2 contractor personnel to work the Pilot Information Extraction task in Phase II.</p>
<p>The following sections of the PWS have been modified: Section III Specific Tasks, Phase II and Phase III; Section IV Deliverables and Reports, Phase II. Please see the attached document entitled Amendment A002 revised PWS for the most recently revised PWS. The document entitled "Amendment A002 Revised PWS" shall now be used as the official Performance Work Statement for Solicitation number SB1341-11-RQ-0130. <br /><br />The Instructions and Evaluations section has been revised to show this change as well. The instructions for Volume I, B- Technical Approach have been updated to state that "The Offeror shall identify the 2 contractor personnel that they have selected to work the Pilot Information Extraction Task in Phase II, which is detailed in the PWS. These 2 contractor personnel that are selected by the Offeror shall only work 5 topics in Phase III, as opposed to 6 topics, as detailed in the PWS." <br /><br />Furthermore, the instructions for Volume II of the Offeror's quotation have been updated to incorporate these changes. Please see the attachment entitled "Amendment A002 Revised Instructions and Evaluations" for the amended instructions for quotation preparation and submission, and evaluation factors for award.<br /><br />The document entitled "Amendment A002 Revised Instructions and Evaluation" shall now be used as the official Instructions and Evaluation for Solicitation number SB1341-11-RQ-0130. <br /><br />END OF TEXT.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, are being utilized for this acquisition. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-48.
<p>Offerors will be responsible for obtaining related amendments to this solicitation, if any, from www.fbo.gov. It is the responsibility of each potential offeror to monitor www.fbo.gov for any amendments or other information related to this solicitation. Any communications regarding this acquisition must be made in writing and forwarded via email to Divya Soni at divya.soni@nist.gov and shall identify the solicitation number, company name, company address, as well as point of contact email address and phone number.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 423430 with a size standard of 100 employees. This requirement is being competed as a small business set-aside whereby Apple-authorized resellers/business partners will be the potential offeror base.</p>
<p>APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES FOR THIS SOLICITATION:<br />The Following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation:<br />FAR 52.212-1; FAR 52.212-3; FAR 52.212-4; FAR 52.212-5, including 52.222-50, 52.233-3, and 52.233-4 in paragraph (a)(1), and the following fill-ins in paragraph (b): 52.222-3; 52.222-19; 52.222-21; 52.222-26; 52.222-36; 52.225-13; 52.232-33. All provisions and clauses viewed at http://acquisition.gov/comp/far/index.html.<br /><br />The following Section 508 Standards of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 apply to this acquisition:<br />o 1194.21 Software applications and operating systems. <br />o 1194.26 Desktop and portable computers.<br />o 1194.31 Functional performance criteria.<br />o 1194.41 Information, documentation, and support.</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology's Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) currently uses a number of pieces of Apple software and hardware that must function seamlessly together. The hardware has been configured to allow ITL to create a small wall of monitors (up to 6 displays) which will comprise a giant computer desktop. ITL has performed a series of imaging experiments in the recent past using software called OsiriX which is a 3D medical imaging system (that only runs on Apple systems). ITL has a requirement for two additional Apple systems and software.<br /><br />This requirement consists of the Contract Line Items in the attached RFQ. Quotations shall be tailored to the exact items listed. <br /><br />BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION:<br />The National Institute of Standards and Technology's Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) currently owns and uses Apple hardware and software. There are a number of future experiments planned, such as exporting from the DICOM medical imaging standard to WebGL based formats, that cannot be performed on anything other than Apple based systems.</p>
<p>All responsible offerors that are small businesses and are Apple-authorized resellers/business partners are invited to submit quotations in accordance with the instructions below. Only quotes from Apple authorized resellers/business partners will be accepted and evaluated. <br /><br />ADDENDUM TO PROVISION 52.212-1 - QUOTATION SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS <br />Paragraph (b) below replaces paragraph (b) in provision 52.212-1.<br />(b) Submission of quotations. Submit dated quotations to the office specified in this solicitation at or before the exact time specified in this solicitation. Quotations may be submitted on company letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, quotations must include- <br />(1) The solicitation number; <br />(2) The name, address, and telephone number of the offeror; <br />(3) Technical description of the items being offered in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with requirements in the solicitation. Item MUST meet exact specifications as laid out in the description attached. This may include product literature, or other documents, if necessary;<br />(4) Terms of any expressed warranty;<br />(5) Firm-fixed price for each CLIN and discount terms;<br />(6) Acknowledgement of solicitation amendment(s);<br />(7) Include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Quotations that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.</p>
<p>NIST reserves the right to award a purchase order without discussions, based solely on the submission of the Contractor.</p>
<p>EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD: The award will be made to the responsible authorized offeror whose technically acceptable quotation is deemed to represent the lowest price. Quotations that are simply a copy of the attached RFQ will not be considered technically acceptable. Offers must provide a technical description of the exact items being offered in sufficient detail to demonstrate compliance with the requirements. Offers that meet all of the above requirements will be deemed technically acceptable.</p>
<p>Quotations must be emailed to divya.soni@nist.gov.</p>

The purpose of this amendment is to provide responses to the following questions posed by potential offerors:<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Question 1</strong></span>: CLIN 0010 (Mac Pro Specifications) says "A Set of at least 7 x 27" Flat panel Displays" which is similar to CLIN 0007. Are these additional 7 Monitors?
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Response 1</span></strong>: This is a duplication. We need a total of seven monitors. CLIN 0010 has been amended to remove the monitors, as this requirement is already listed in CLIN 0007. CLIN 0007 has been amended to provide specifications for the monitors.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question 2</span></strong>: For CLIN 0002, is there a Part # or a preferred Brand for these speakers?</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Response 2</strong></span>: No, there is no preferred brand as long as the speakers meet the specifications listed and are compatible with the Apple system.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Question 3</strong></span>: Is the Software Quick Link 7Pro for Mac OS X the same as Software Quick Time 7Pro for Max OS X?</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Response 3</strong></span>: We are not familiar with Quick Link 7 Pro. Please quote the software requested (Quick Time 7 Pro for Mac OS X).<br /><br /><br />UPDATED:<br />Please see the attached RFQ dated 3/10/11 for updated requirements.</p>

The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is&nbsp;541511 and business size is $7.0. The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Office of Ocean &amp; Coastal Resource Management (OCRM) has a requirement to develop a "Coral App," a mobile application that to integrate state fishery regulations with various existing NOAA ocean data and products, delivered in a local and temporally-relevant manner to the public. The Coral App is to be developed in two phases, with features serving primarily two audiences: (1) National (US): ocean conservation public, and (2) Local (Florida): recreational fishermen. The Coral App will serve a national audience by displaying news content related to coral reefs featured in the CRCP's web and Facebook pages, coral bleach warnings and seasonal outlooks, sustainable seafood consumer information, and other relevant NOAA data and information. The local audience (Florida) will be served by delivering state recreational fishery regulations applicable to a user's exact location and time (including local MPA boundaries shown relative to user) and NOAA data relevant to local users (ocean temperature, currents, etc) into a single, user-friendly interface. Coral App will make state fishery regulations more accessible and add a mechanism for user interaction and tools to help disseminate recreational fishery regulations. We seek quotes broken down into costs for developing a Coral App for a national audience (first phase), and the follow up jurisdictional audience (second phase); each containing feature sets outlined in this document. Coral App will be initially developed in a single platform, either iPhone or Android, to be determined at time of award (vendor must have expertise in both platforms).

<p>STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES</p>
<p>REPORT PROVIDING RECOMMENDATIONS ON A POTENTIAL REVISION OF 10 CFR 190</p>
<p><br />PROJECT OFFICER:</p>
<p>Brian Littleton<br />202- 343-9216</p>
<p>PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:</p>
<p>Date of award through September 30, 2012</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Radiation Protection Division, is interested in identifying options and issues as it looks at potentially revising 40 CFR Part 190. For this action, we are specifically interested in potential changes to 40 CFR Part 190.10(b). As we potentially move to a new phase of nuclear power in the 21st century, the Agency wants to better understand if the current 33 year old standards are relevant, environmentally protective and enforceable. Because Section 190.10(b) addresses issues that would affect spent nuclear fuel reprocessing, any changes to this section would be controversial. If EPA were to change this section, our goal would be for it to be environmentally protective. EPA has nost taken a position on the issue of reprocessing, however, it is a possibility for which EPA's regulations need to adequately account.</p>
<p>PURPOSE:</p>
<p>The primary goal of this work would be for a nationally recognized group to develop a document which will provide technical recommendation to EPA on a targeted technical issues to be addressed in a potential revision of 40 CFR 190.10(b) The recommendations provided in the document would be focused on issues, such as the use of collective dose, impacting the "radionuclide cap" aspect of its regulation as stated in 40 CFR Part 190.10(b).</p>
<p>The proposed work would help identify key issues and suggest technical options for protecting human health and the environment from radiation releases for nuclear power operations. These technical options will need to address what would need to be considered by the Agency if it were to follow any particular option related to 40 CFR Part 190.10(b). The document will bring up specific topics in a systematic manner and receive input from technical experts on each issue. When possible, consensus regarding an issue will be noted. However, consensus of several of these issues may not be possible. If this is the case, then the goal of the document will be to provide various approaches that the Agency could take with regards to an issue, and discuss the technical strengths and weaknesses of each approach. This document will be published by the contactor in an appropriate format (formal Proceedings, Commentary, Report, etc.)</p>
<p>PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVE:</p>
<p>The Agency is seeking expert consultation from qualified scientists and experts in radiation matters. Merit shall be given to quotes which include consultation of experts such as past and/or present members of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Council or Radiation Protection and measurement, the Agency's Science Advisory Board, and/or other recognized independent technical advisory organizations.</p>
<p>DELIVERABLES</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide the following support: convene a group of technical experts for the purpose of soliciting opinions and recommendations regarding manners to protect the public from exposure to radiation resulting from nuclear energy operations covered by 40 CFR Part 190.10(b), which will focus on 10(b). The contractor shall propose the manner with which it will fulfill this criteria (ie How will information be obtained from each expert: How will consensus be sought and what criteria will be used to determine consensus; In what manner will the findings be published, etc). The quote shall address proposed personnel and the manner for publishing the findings.</p>
<p>Specific topics to be addressed in the final documentation include the following:</p>
<p>1. Radionuclide Inventory - Are the suite of radionuclide's specified in the existing standard (kr-85, I-129 and Pu-239 and other alpha-emitting TRU) those radionuclide's of highest concern? Should some radionuclide's be eliminated from the regulated list? Should some radionuclide's be added to the current list?</p>
<p>2. Strengths and weaknesses of current approach - Are the original objectives of the Agency's standard still reasonable? Is the concept of environmental dose commitment a desirable endpoint? Should any regulatory action continue to use an endpoint, local, regional, national, and worldwide populations? How has it worked in the 33 years of the regulations? Is it appropriate to consider the following three points of view 1) the potential public health impact attributable to each radioactive material, 2) the combined potential public health impact of various components of the fuel cycle, 3) the integrated public health impact of the entire fuel cycle due to projected future growth?</p>
<p>3. Alternate Approaches - Given the information collected in the previous tasks, what are the potential alternative options that the Agency could use in revising 190.10(b), and what are the issues, and technical strengths, and weaknesses associated with those options. For example, would a combination of approaches be appropriate, such as maintaining a cap based on collective dose considerations, while establishing a facility based limit as well? Would the existing standard be more practicable (e.g., enforceable, protective) on a facility by facility basis? The Agency understands that cost information may be difficult to obtain, however, the Agency would like to understand the different options' their relative costs so that the Agency could understand if a particular approach is so costly it would not be attempted.</p>
<p><br />The deliverables for this work assignment shall be:</p>
<p>1. A draft consultation report which summarizes the communications of the technical workgroup. The report will note any consensus recommendations that resulted from the communications and any major issues where differences were noted.</p>
<p>2. A final consultation report which clarifies any questions that the EPA Project Officer may have regarding issues covered in the report.</p>
<p><br />SCHEDULE AND DELIVERABLES</p>
<p>TASK NO: DELIVERABLE DUE DATE<br />Task 1: Draft Consultation/Report Within 12 Months of Contract Award<br />Task 2: Final Consultation/Report Within 15 Months of Contract Award</p>

<DESC><p>The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions posed by interested vendors and clarify the requirement. <strong>Quote submission has been extended to 14 March 2011, 12:00 pm Alaskan Daylight Time.</strong></p>
<p>1. Do you have a picture of the board you need?<br />Answer: Yes, pictures of the frame have been attached to this solicitation. <br /><br />2. The specifications given for the LED board references "Proline 100 Software", which is used for boards manufactured by Fair-Play/Translux. Are you limiting the solicitation to just this one manufacturer or will you accept alternate manufacturers providing they meet the other specifications?<br />Answer: Alternate manufacturers are acceptable. <br /><br />3. The pixel matrix is listed as 432x 64 which I assume should read 32x64?<br />Answer: Yes, it should read 32x64.<br /><br />4. I wanted to know if an equivalent was acceptable.<br />Answer: Yes, equivalent items are acceptable. <br /><br />5. Can you use ethernet instead of a phone modem?<br />Answer: No, a modem hook up is at the existing frame.<br /><br />6. Is the sign in the bid an outdoor sign? <br />Answer: Yes. <br /><br />7. Will the bid be awarded as all or nothing? <br />Answer: Yes.<br /><br />8. Will the bid be awarded to only 1 company for both installation and supplying the sign? <br />Answer: Yes, only one company will be awarded a contract for the removal of the existing LED board and installation of a&nbsp;new LED Board.<br /><br />9. Can we just bid on the sign and not the install portion of the work? <br />Answer: No, a quote for just the sign will be considered non-responsive. <br /><br />10. How is the sign installed? On a monument? On a pole? Etc.<br />Answer: The LED Board is on an existing rectangular wooden frame outdoors. <br /><br />11. Is electrical and communication cable currently at the sign site? <br />Answer: Yes.<br /><br />12. The specifications state: 432 x 64 pixel matrix with a 35 mm pitch. However, given these specifications, there is a discrepancy, the dimensions of the sign would be 88.1" H x 595.2" W, however, the Cabinet Dimensions specified is 51" H x 92" W. Can you please clarify these specifications? <br />Answer: 432x64 is a typo; the correct pixel matrix is 32x64. <br /><br />13. What is the maximum area that is available to fit the LED Sign?<br />Answer: The existing inside dimensions are 4'3"(H), 7'8" (W) and 8" in depth. <br /><br />14. Will you be considering alternate pixel sizes?<br />Answer: Yes.</p>
<p>For clarification: This purchase is for <strong>brand name or equal products</strong>. The LED Board is to be placed inside an existing wooden rectangular frame located outdoors by an intersection. The maximum space inside the frame is 4'3"(H), 7'8" (W) and 8" in depth. This space is for one double-sided LED Board; there is no divider on the frame between the existing boards. The pixel size can vary according to the manufacturer, as long as characters on the Board can be readable from passing vehicles. The software that is installed with the board must be PC-compatible, Apple software cannot be accepted. For weather considerations; installation shall take place No Later Than 31 May 2011 with coordination by the end user. <br /><br />Any further questions can be emailed to SrA Bethany Carlan at <a href="mailto:bethany.carlan@elmendorf.af.mil">bethany.carlan@elmendorf.af.mil</a>&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>The Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO), Satellite Programs Acquisition Division (SPAD), intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with EMS Technologies, Norcross, Georgia, for LEOLUT and GEOLUT upgrades using the procedures in FAR Part 15. The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 USC253(c) (1) as implemented in FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."
<p>This contract would be to refurbish 10 Local User Terminal (LUT) by procuring and installing new server and hardware "components" to maintain the health in 8 operational and 2 test LUTs. The strategy for implementation will be to refurbish 10 LUTs at 4 sites (AK, FL, MD, and GU) and include one base year of Operations and Maintenance. There will be an option to perform the same upgrade to 4 additional operational LUTs at 2 sites (HI and CA).</p>
<p>In addition to the above, this contract will have the option to extend Operations and Maintenance (O&amp;M) including providing technical and operational support on a yearly basis, for up to 4 additional years for a total of 5 years inclusive of all options. The decision to upgrade rather than replace the LUTs will drastically reduce any downtime associated with transition and cost for completely new LUT's.</p>
<p>North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 517919 applies. The small business size standard for NAICS Code 517919 is $25 million.</p>
<p>All inquiries should be submitted in writing by e-mail to Edith.L.Jones@noaa.gov referencing RFP No. DG133E-11-RP-0072. No telephone inquiries will be accepted.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available. However, if any other interested parties believe that they can meet the Government's requirements, they may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which if timely received will be considered by NOAA. ALL information must be submitted within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. The capability statement and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NOAA to determine if the party can meet all of the requirements. Please provide commercial and government pricing. Responses must also be accompanied by descriptive literature, warranties, and/or other information that demonstrates that the proposal meets all of the requirements. Capability statements and related materials must be emailed to the point of contact by March 11, 2011. Award will be made using FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation, current through FAC 2005-48. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within discretion of the Federal Government. The information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>Synopsis

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Technology Acquisition Center (TAC), Eatontown, NJ 07724, intends to procure a Call Center to set up the Million Veterans Project (MVP).  This effort will be procured as a Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) direct award to Standard Communications Inc., 5402 Leeds Manor Road, Hume, VA 22639.  This direct award will be issued under the authority of the VETERANS FIRST PROGRAM pursuant to FAR 6.302-5, and VAAR 819.7007.  The Massachusetts Veterans Epidemiological Research Information Center (MAVERIC) research group at the VA Boston Healthcare System has been designated as a VA Cooperative Studies and Clinical Trials Coordinating Center. MAVERIC provides statistical programming and analytical support to a number of research programs around the country. Personalized medicine and large scale genomic research have been established as strategic Initiatives for the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and the VA Office of Research and Development (ORD).  In order to achieve the longer term personalized medicine mission an infrastructure must first be put into place for collecting, managing, and analyzing genomic data for research operations. Active genomic research efforts in ORD today include genome-wide scans and copy number variation studies in subjects with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, depression, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, post traumatic stress disorder, and also include creation of control groups from the general VHA population within the Million Veterans Project (MVP)  cohort. The goal of this effort is to set up the MVP Call Center and recruit one million veterans.  Recruited veterans will be provided with a toll-free number for the MVP Call Center, monitored by MAVERIC/CSP Genomics Coordinating Center study staff. Study staff will undergo training and be provided with a phone script and FAQ to answer questions that callers have regarding participation in the MVP.  The call center will be capable of making outbound calls to Veterans for follow-up and rescheduling purposes should the need arise. Due to the huge size of the sample cohort an automated turnkey solution is required to make sure incoming calls are not missed and are properly routed. The requested solution has been demonstrated to work with the VA NEC based phone network. It also contains extremely useful features including automatic appointment reminders, 24/7 automated attendant and enhanced call center routing.

The solicitation will be issued as a request for quote (RFQ) from the VA TAC, and the number assigned to it will be VA118-11-RQ-0222.  The associated NAICS code for this effort is 541519, with a small business size standard of $25M.  The proposed action will be a Firm Fixed Price contract, and the equipment shall be delivered 60 days after award.  The anticipated award date is March 31, 2011.

All proposal documents and communications shall be made available through the Contract Specialist, Jessica Adamitis, via email at jessica.adamitis@va.gov, or via telephone at 732.578.5572.

<STAUTH>FAR 6.302-1
<AWDNBR>FA4830-11-M-0020
<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN<br />FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
<p>I. CONTRACTING ACTIVITY: 23rd Contracting Squadron<br />4380B Alabama Road<br />Moody AFB, GA</p>
<p>II. DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION: A Firm Fixed price contract is anticipated to be awarded to GE Sensing to procure a 405 Air Data Test System for the A-10 aircraft at $50,250.00. Awarding the contract to the above mentioned vendor is necessary to ensure physical, electrical and functional compatibility with the existing Air Data Test System Adapter in support of 23rd Fighter Group A-10 aircraft deployment requirement.</p>
<p>III. DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES/SERVICES: 405 Air Data Test System is necessary for the precision calibration/verification of A-10 aircraft pitot statics, compliant with RVSM (Reduced Vertical Separation Minima) requirements.</p>
<p>IV. AUTHORITY 10 USC 2304(c) (1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 (FAR 6.303-2(a) (4)).</p>
<p>V. APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY: The justification for restricting competition is in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation FAR 6.302-1 (Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements).</p>
<p>VI. EFFORTS TO OBTAIN COMPETITION: GE Sensing is the only provider in possession of the necessary components to ensure compatibility with the aircraft Air Data Test Adapter. The A-10 System Program Office (SPO) is aware of the issues that the A-10 aircraft are facing in deployed combat locations and have approved the procurement of the Air Data Test System.</p>
<p>VII. DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS DEEMED PRACTICABLE: <br />A special notice was posted on Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) 10 February 2011, to notify potential sources. Special Notice FA4830WA004 contained a description of the requested item along with instruction on how to contact the 23rd Contracting Squadron with any information or questions concerning the request. Special Notice FA4830WA004 closed 17 February 2011 at 1:00pm. No responses were received regarding the special notice.</p>
<p>VIII. ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION: Awarding a contract to GE Sensing is necessary due to the existing system already in place. Replacement of the 405 Air Data Test System to facilitate completion would increase cost and delivery time due to product testing prior to implementation. Therefore, it is in the best interest of the Air Force to award a purchase order to GE Sensing.</p>
<p>IX. LIST OF SOURCES, IF ANY, THAT EXPRESSED INTEREST IN THE ACQUISITION: NONE</p>
<p>X. A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION BEFORE MAKING SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITIONS FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED: This contract will be solicited as a sole source requirement and the 405 Air Data Tester will interface with the current Air Data Test Adapter for deployment purposes. A-10 SPO coordination with the Defense Logistics Agency is currently in coordination for future procurements.</p>
<p>XI. CONTRACTING OFFICER'S CERTIFICATION: "I certify to the best of my knowledge and belief that the information contained in this justification is accurate and complete." This is evidenced by the contracting officer's signature on the Coordination and Approval Document. (FAR 6.303-2(a) (12)).</p>
<p>XII. TECHNICAL/REQUIREMENTS PERSONNEL'S CERTIFICATION: As evidence by their signatures on the Coordination and Approval Document, the technical and/or requirements personnel have certified that any supporting data contained herein, which is their responsibility, is both accurate and complete (FAR 6.303-2(b)).</p>

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN<br />FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
<p>I. CONTRACTING ACTIVITY: 23rd Contracting Squadron<br />4380B Alabama Road<br />Moody AFB, GA</p>
<p>II. DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION: A Firm Fixed price contract will be awarded to Hoffman Engineering Corporation to procure an Insight Panoramic Goggle Adapter Set for the Pilots of the 23rd Fighter Group at $4,852.00. Awarding the contract to the above mentioned vendor is necessary to ensure physical, electrical and functional compatibility with the existing Air Data Test System Adapter in support of 23rd Fighter Group A-10 aircraft deployment requirement.</p>
<p>III. DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES/SERVICES: The Insight Panoramic Goggle Adapter Set is to be used for night vision flying and seeing.</p>
<p>IV. AUTHORITY 10 USC 2304(c) (1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 (FAR 6.303-2(a) (4)).</p>
<p>V. APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY: The justification for restricting competition is in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation FAR 6.302-1 (Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements).</p>
<p>VI. EFFORTS TO OBTAIN COMPETITION: Hoffman Engineering Corporation is the only provider in possession of the necessary items to ensure compatibility with the Panoramic Goggles.</p>
<p>VII. DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS DEEMED PRACTICABLE: <br />A special notice was posted on Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) 18 February 2011, to alert potential sources.

Special Notice FA4830WA005 closed 25 February 2011 at 1:00pm. No responses were received regarding the special notice.</p>
<p>VIII. ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION: Awarding a contract to Hoffman Engineering Corporation is necessary due to the existing goggles already at Moody AFB. Replacement of the Adapter Set to facilitate completion would increase cost and waste government money because all of the existing goggles would no longer be able to be used even if in perfect working condition. Therefore, it is in the best interest of the Air Force to award a purchase order to Hoffman Engineering Corporation.</p>
<p>IX. LIST OF SOURCES, IF ANY, THAT EXPRESSED INTEREST IN THE ACQUISITION: NONE</p>
<p>X. A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION BEFORE MAKING SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITIONS FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED: This contract will be solicited as a sole source requirement and the Insight Panoramic Adapter Set will interface with the current Insight Panoramic Goggles for deployment purposes. This item is proprietary to Hoffman Engineering and another company's components would not be compatible wit the existing goggles. This item will remain sole source until goggles become outdated or cost for repair exceeds replacement cost.</p>
<p>XI. CONTRACTING OFFICER'S CERTIFICATION: "I certify to the best of my knowledge and belief that the information contained in this justification is accurate and complete." This is evidenced by the contracting officer's signature on the Coordination and Approval Document. (FAR 6.303-2(a) (12)).</p>
