<ARCHDATE>09102003
<CONTACT>Susie Zimmer Contracting Officer 2083785156 szimmer@pn.usbr.gov;
<DESC>Set-Aside: This requirement is not set-aside for small business concerns, and is issued pursuant to the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 235990 and the size standard is $12 million.  The Bureau of Reclamation intends to issue a solicitation this winter (early 2003)  for rock bolting the left abutment downstream of Deadwood Dam. The site is not accessible at the time offers will be solicited and received, so we are conducting a site visit this fall so potential offerors can inspect the left abutment work conditions, access in and out of the site, living conditions needed on site, etc.  On site work is scheduled for July 1 through October 1, 2003.  WE STRONGLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO ATTEND THIS SITE VISIT IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN COMPETING FOR THE CONTRACT WHEN THE REQUIREMENT IS SOLICITED.   The major work consists of installing approximately 85 (tensioned) rock bolts into the left abutment.  The drill holes will be up to 4-inches in diameter and vary in length from 20 feet to 50 feet for a total footage of about 3800 feet.  The rock bolts (high-strength number 11 bars) will be grouted through the anchor length, tensioned, then grouted the rest of the length.  Concrete bearing pads and/or steel bearing plates will be required for tensioning. Some scaling of the rock slope will be required before rock bolting begins.  Also, about 1000 cubic yards of loose material will have to be excavated from the upper portion of the  left abutment and disposed of at a nearby site. The left abutment is very steep (near vertical in places) and is positioned above the stilling basin (Deadwood River). Irrigation releases  will be made continuously throughout the summer. Drill fluid and grout  will not be allowed to enter the river.  The abutment is approximately  140 feet high.  Access to the left abutment work area is limited.  Access will have to be from the dam crest or from the top of the abutment down.  The attached photos show the left abutment area.  Time and Date of Site Visit: September 24, 2002, at 7:00 a.m.  Place to Meet for Site Visit: Meet in front of the Bureau of Reclamation Regional Office Building at 1150 North Curtis Road, Boise, Idaho, to caravan to the dam site.  The drive to the site takes 2-½ to 3 hours.  Plan on returning to Boise after 5:00 pm.  You will need to bring a lunch.  We will stop at a grocery store on the way out of town for those who need lunch supplies. (If it is more convenient for you to meet at the dam site, please notify the contact person below).  Location of Project:  Deadwood Dam is located in a remote area about 55 air miles northeast of Boise, Idaho, and 90 road miles from the Regional Office in Boise, Idaho.  We will travel tothe dam site by taking State Highway 55 north out of Boise, Idaho.  At Banks, we will turn east on the Banks to Lowman road.  We will continue past Garden Valley about 13 miles and turn north on FR 555 (Scott Mountain Road).  The dam is located 26 miles from the turnoff.  FR 555 is a windy, steep (grades up to 13%), mostly one-lane, unpaved road that goes up over Scott Mountain (summit elevation 7500 feet - the dam is at elevation 5300 feet).   A high-clearance vehicle is recommended.  It takes about 1 hour to travelthe 26 miles along FR 555.  We should arrive at the dam site around 10:00 a.m.  There are two other routes into the dam site; however, both routes are longer if you are traveling from Boise.  One route is to continue east past the FR 555 turnoff until you reach Lowman, Idaho. At Lowman, leave the pavement and travel 31 miles on FR 582 to Bear Valley,then travel 16 miles west on FR 579 (Landmark to Stanley road).  Continue south on FR 555 another 12 miles to the dam site.  The third route is to continue north at Banks on State Highway 55 through the town of Cascade, Idaho.  Just north of Cascade, travel east for 33 miles on FR 22, past Warm Lake to the Landmark junction were the pavement ends.  Head south on FR 579 another 18 miles where the road meets FR 555.  Continue south on FR 555 another 12 miles to the dam site.  The route through Cascade and Warm Lake is recommended for heavy equipment travel.  If  travel to the dam is over Scott Mountain (as described above), contractors  are urged to take this route when leaving the dam, so the condition of  both roads can be assessed. All routes are impassable from about mid-October until about mid-June due to winter conditions.  Contact for Additional Information: For more information on the site visit only, contact Don Rosbaugh at (208) 334-1010.  Please notify Mr. Rosbaugh if you plan on participating in the site visit.  Set-Aside: This requirement is not set-aside for small business concerns, and is issued pursuant to the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 235990 and the size standard is $12 million  Estimated Price Range of the Project: $500,000 to $1,000,000.  Solicitation Availability: The solicitation for this project will be a negotiated, best-value solicitation, that will consider at a minimum, the offeror's experience and past performance related to projects of similar difficulty.  Information pertaining to the solicitation for this project will be advertised in the future on our website, www.pn.usbr.gov/contracts/construction.

<DESC>NA This contract serves to establish center and home-based psycho-educational secondary prevention programs and services with an emphasis placed on high-risk families.  The services and programs provided under this contract are to be fully integrated within t he overall Family Advocacy mission and service delivery system. The contractor's role is to prevent abuse, not to provide treatment services or therapy to people identified as spouse or child abusers.  However, the contractor may work with individual and/o r families who had abuse in their history to help them develop skills to break the cycle of abuse. The contractor shall help clients set goals for positive changes in family relationships and behaviors that can help them improve their knowledge and skills in parenting, personal relationships, and Army family living.  The contractor shall accomplish these goals by working with individuals, by providing education and training classes, and/or by referring individuals and families to other resources and organiz ations.  These prevention efforts are to help soldiers and family members build skills that will prevent spouse and child abuse and to help them become healthy soldiers and healthy families. The contractor shall develop and document an individualized preve ntion plan for each assessed individual or family group to help them reach their goals.  Plans will include, as appropriate, psychosocial family risk issues for abuse, cognitive/behavioral skills training, child behavior management, parent/child bonding, a nger and/or stress management, conflict management, and referral to community agencies and programs and to ACS prevention classes as indicated.  The contractor must provide a brief presentation about at risk families on a regular basis with FAP therapists for feedback and referral for therapy services.  Additionally, the contractor must maintain regular contact with the FAP therapists on all abuse cases referred for psycho-educational services as a part of the overall treatment plan.  The services may be cl ient home based or in the office. Primary prevention programs teach skills to newly wed and first time parents with the assumption all new couples and parents can use some help with conflict management and parenting.  Secondary prevention programs address families with a chaotic history, who have been identified as high-risk families because of a number of factors.  They may be very young parents, dual active duty, have a history of drug or alcohol abuse, physical, emotional or sexual abuse, mental illness or other issues that get in the way of parenting and healthy relationships.  Tertiary prevention programs provide skills to people who have already had substantiated incidents of family violence.  The skills are intended to prevent subsequent incidents.  T he contractor shall meet the following qualifications as a minimum and provide the requested listed documents.  The contractor is encouraged to cite all credentials, which he or she is entitled to claim. Submission above and beyond the minimum requirements  will merit additional consideration.  Minimum qualifications should include but are not limited to: 1. Copy of Baccalaureate of Science in Nursing (BSN) or Bachelors of Social Work, Psychology, or related human services field degree from an accredited col lege or university. 2. Copies of licenses and/or registrations from all states in which provider is credentialed. The contractor must have one active state license or state certification.  3.Copy of board certifications (BCD) or Accreditation of Certified Social Work (ACSW), if applicable. 4.  Evidence of a minimum of 2 years experience in Nursing or Social Work that provided individual or group intervention, home visitation, prevention programs and services, education or advocacy services in spouse and/or child abuse to at-risk families. 5.  Evidence of experience developing, maintaining and facilitating groups which promote healthy families and help clients incr ease their own coping skills.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy?s National Energy Technology Laboratory is publishing this Synopsis/Non-Competitive Solicitation (RFQ) in accordance with FAR 5.203, FAR 12.603 and FAR 13.105. The U.S. Department of Energy?s National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) is publishing this synopsis/non-competitive solicitation for the purchase of the Siemens Procidia Control System for the Fuel Processing Laboratory (FPL)from Gilson Engineering Sales, Inc.  Gilson Engineering Sales, Inc. is the only known authorized area distributor and supplier  for the Siemens Procidia Control System. The Siemens Procidia Control System, as specified, will provide several needed features that other control systems of this type cannot provide.  Procidia will provide the automatic generation of several important configuration elements that will greatly reduce the overall configuration effort.  For example, the 1/config software accommodates both continuous (function block) and discrete (ladder logic) control requirments, and the database is automatically generated from controller configuration whereupon the HMI (Human Machine Interface) is generated from the database which minimizes the possibility of manual errors.  In addition, i/config has existing pre-formatted control strategies such as a library of algorithms and preconfigured function blocks that make configuration as simple as dropping blocks on a sheet.  Procidia will also provide on-line monitoring of configuration values to aid in troubleshooting efforts.  The following is a list of line items to be purchased (the quantity of each line item is in () beside each item: 1. iPAC-CC-B4  (2) 2. iPAC-PSUA-B4 (2) 3. iPAC-CM-ENRN-B4 (2) 4. iO-4TC (8) 5. iO-8AI-2H  (8) 6. iO-8AO-H  (4) 7. iO-8D124DMN  (12) 8. iO-8DO60DMN  (4) 9. iO-FST8-FT  (28) 10. iO-STC-FT  (8) 11. iO-8MC  (4) 12. iO-LCE  (4) 13. iO-RCE  (4) 14. iOCEC120 (4) 15. 15124-1 (2) 16. 15124-3  (2) 17. iO-MBK  (2) 18. iPAC-FHD-B4 (2) 19. iWARE-BO5-V2.00 (2) 20. iWARE-EO5-V2.00 (2) 21. 16357-43  (2)

<DESC>CAPITOL VISITOR CENTER, SEQUENCE 2, MECHANICAL, ELECTRICAL, PLUMBING AND BUILDOUT.  The Architect of the Capitol (AOC), with the assistance of the General Services Administration (GSA), announces this opportunity for Construction Excellence in Public Buildings and the intent to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) for Construction Services for The United States Capitol Visitor Center (CVC), and related work in and around the U. S. Capitol Building, Washington, DC. The CVC will greatly enhance the experience of visiting the U.S. Capitol building. Not only will it significantly enhance security for the Capitol, but it will provide new educational opportunities for visitors and improve accessibility and visitor comfort. As designed, the CVC will compliment the Capitol building and its surroundings and will become a seamless addition to the Capitol complex. The CVC will be located underground on the East Front of the Capitol, so as to enhance rather than detract from the appearance of the Capitol and its historic Frederick Law Olmsted landscaping. When completed, the CVC will contain approximately 580,000 square feet on three levels, requiring approximately a 196,000-square-foot excavation, or "footprint," on the East Front of the Capitol. The CVC will include space for exhibits, visitor comfort, food service, two orientation theaters, an auditorium, gift shops, security, connections to existing buildings, service tunnels for underground vehicle access to the Capitol, loading docks, mechanical facilities, and storage. The CVC will preserve and maximize public access to the Capitol while greatly enhancing the experience for the millions who walk its historic corridors and experience its monumental spaces every year. This solicitation will address only a portion of the work required to complete the CVC, as noted below. The Architect of the Capitol will utilize a ?best value? source selection process to enable selection from among high quality contractors for this procurement. The project is being constructed in two (2) sequences and will require extensive coordination between this contractor and contractors of prior enabling projects and the Sequence 1, Excavation/Foundation/Structure contractor, as well as with contractors performing other AOC projects in the immediate vicinity of the project. This advertisement is for Sequence 2 of the project. Sequence 2 includes but is not limited to the build-out of the interior spaces, installation of electrical, mechanical and plumbing systems, coordination with existing Capitol building systems where the CVC connects within the Capitol building, and completion of the aboveground Plaza among other activities. The estimated construction cost for Sequence 2 is in the range of $100 to $125 million. The Contractor must provide all management, supervision, labor, materials, supplies, and equipment (except as otherwise provided), and must plan, schedule, coordinate and assure effective performance of all construction to meet AOC schedule, budget and operational requirements. The Contractor will perform the construction in accordance with the design specifications, drawings and provisions of the contract. The solicitation for Sequence 2 will be issued in two (2) phases. Phase I will be for technical proposals and will include a set of draft specifications and drawings. It will be available on or about 09/24/2002. Under Phase I the Government will evaluate past experience and performance, technical and management capabilities.  After evaluation, offerors will be advised of their technical standing prior to issuance of Phase II, which will be a request for offerors of high technical merit to submit pricing proposals based upon completed specifications and drawings.  Phase II of the solicitation will be issued approximately 45 days after receipt of proposals for Phase I. After evaluation of Phase I and Phase II proposals, the government will award a fixed-price contract to the responsive and responsible offeror determined by the government to be offering the ?best value.? For this procurement, technical factors, when combined, are significantly more important than price. No specific numerical weight will be assigned to price for evaluation purposes. Competitive formal source selection procedures will be used similar to those in FAR 15. Offerers are advised that award may be made without discussion or any contact concerning the proposals received. The government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all offerors; to award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; and to award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the government to be the most advantageous to the government. Therefore, proposals should be submitted initially on the most favorable terms. NOTE: Firms submitting technical and price proposals will not be compensated for proposal preparation costs. To be considered for final award, firms must submit proposals per the RFP to BOTH Phase I and Phase II of the solicitation on the due dates established. A pre-proposal conference/subcontractor outreach forum will be held on October 2, 2002 at Loews L?Enfant Plaza Hotel, Washington, D.C. Interested parties may pre-register for the forum by going to http://cvcoutreach.gilbaneco.com or by contacting the forum coordinator, Alyce Fitzpatrick at (301) 317-6149. The RFP Phase I will be issued by the Contract Specialist at GSA, Mid Atlantic Region in Philadelphia, PA, and posted electronically on the www.fedbizops.gov website. A compact disk (CD) of the draft specifications and drawings will be issued by the AOC, Washington, DC. Final technical specifications and drawings will be issued with Phase II of this solicitation.  In order for potential offerors to be placed on the bidders list, respondents must submit a written request via fax to Cal Durgin, (202) 228-2073 or e-mailed to cdurgin@aoc.gov.  Any questions regarding this synopsis may be directed to Cal Durgin, CVC Contract Manager, at (202) 228-2370 or Dan Correnti, GSA Contract Specialist, at (215) 656-6152. This procurement is being conducted under full and open competition on an unrestricted basis under NAIC code 233320.

<DESC>The COASTSYSTA intends to issue a sole-source purchase order to Vehicle Control Technologies (VCT) for modification of the AN/AQS-20A localizer algorithm.    The AN/AQS-20 Localizer algorithm is being configured for use in the MH-53E, MH-60S, and shipboard configurations.  Recently, VCT was tasked to modify and analyze the AN/AQS-20A localizer Algorithm to be compatible with the three platforms.  Based on the results, the Localizer Algorithm requires additional modification for shipboard and MH-53E configurations.  VCT is the only company that can accomplish this task because VCT has performed all of the mathematic modeling for the AN/AQS-20/A tow body.  VCT is the company that created and owns the localizer algorithm.  To accurately modify the localizer algorithm is critical.  Use of another company to conduct the modifications may introduce new, or change existing parameters th at may induce unacceptable errors into the localizer algorithm.  Failure to have an accurate localizer algorithm could result in significant damage to the AN/AQS-20A tow body and maybe even loss of U. S. Navy vessels.  Therefore VCT is the only company that can meet Government requirements.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI)on behalf of the National Institues of Neurological Disease and Stroke (NINDS) intends on entering into a sole source contract with the National Rehabilitation Hospital (NHR), 102 Irving Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20010.  NINDS will collaborate with the NRH for evaluation of two groups of stroke patients before and after a 40 day intervention or placebo.  NINDS protocol #98-N-0115 which started in 1998 has experienced serious recruitment problems due to the fact that the NIH physicians do not routinely see stroke patients in the early rehabilitation process (between 5 and 30 days following the stroke event), the collaboration with NRH is of great value to NINDS because of the large population of stroke patients and important insertion in the Washington stroke community.  The collaboration with NRH will greatly enhance recruitment under protocol 98-N-0115 and to partially cover expenses incurred by NRH during patient treatments called for under this protocol.  In order for NRH to participate in this protocol, NRH will have to maintain patients admitted beyond the time period covered by the insurance companies.  The protocol calls for 2-3 days of testing at NIH, followed by 30-40 days treatment period (physical therapy+drug or physical therapy+placebo) and finally 2-3 days post treatment testing will be done at the NIH.  There will be a total of 20 patients participation in protocol within less than 2 years.  The Contract period is for one year with one 12-month option period. FAR clauses 52.217-9 Options to Extend the Term of the Contract and 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services, are included by reference. The National Rehabilitation Hospital is the only source known to the government hat can provide the above requirements specified.  However, if any interested party belieives it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the Governments need.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office no later than September 25, 2002.  This action is pursuant to 41 USC 253(1) and under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  The requirement will be procured as a non-commercial item in accordance with FAR Part 13. If you have any questions, please contact Cynthia Brown, Purchasing Agent, (301) 402-4509.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely for the purpose of determining whehter to conduct a competitive procurement.

The CMPU initiative is intended to spearhead opportunities for bridging basic and clinical research efforts by more precisely optimizing development, characterization and utilization of models of human disease.  The initiative includes both applied research and collaborations aimed at developing new reagents, methods, and technologies in preclinical diagnostic medicine, thus enhancing capabilities to integrate molecular and systemic aspects of disease mechanisms.  Designing and employing state of the art medical and pathology investigative tools to the study of animal models helps promote translational phenotype comprehension, and therefore improves model predictability for human cancer diseases.  The CMPU will use the autostainer in tissue processing for Immunohistological and in SITU Hybridization, and to perform immunostains on slides prepared using existing Government-owned Dako equipment. The instrument has also been optimized by investigators in LP for the development of protein chip arrays.  Investigators intend to follow the published methods to extend findings made in this novel area of tissue proteomics, for mouse model systems.  It is critical that new variables not be introduced into these on-going protocols.  Therefore, for consistency of data the system must be procured from the Dako Corportion.  The system shall have the following mandatory features/specifications: the autostainer shall, 1) be on open system allowing all reagents to be user defined and supplied, 2) be completely user programmable and have a programming system compatible with, and able to export, program parameters to other PC based computers and software, 3)separate hazardous chemical waste from non-hazardous waste, 4) not reuqire purchase of consumable products (including bar code labels and dispensing tips), other than liquid reagents, 5) not utilize liquid coverslips as a part of its operation, 6) be capable of dispensing different volumes of reagents and in different zones on the target slide, 7) have a total slide capacity of no less than forty-eight (48) slides and a reagent capacity of sixty-four (64) differnet reagents (15 mL/reagent vial), 8) be capable of performing immunoistochemistry, utilizing  chromogenic and fluorescent detection systems, and 9) be capable of double staining and utilization of more than one detection system (color/reagent) in a single operational run of the system.  Additionally, the slide track capacity shall be 1-12 glass slides US and international sizes); total slide capacity shall be 1-48 glass slides (US and international sizes); reagent dispense volumes shall be 100, 150, 200, 400 and 600uL; and, reagent probe volume shall be 100uL minimum, 1.2mL maximum.

<DESC>1. INTRODUCTION

Bechtel SAIC Company, LLC (BSC) is hereby expressing interest in obtaining information from firms that have a Route Selection and Optimization Model that is capable of fulfilling the requirements described below. 

Responding firms (Respondents) must submit documentation as specified in Section 4 below that provides detailed information on similar types of work performed and completed in application of their model. Sufficient detail should be included to allow BSC to evaluate the firm??s model, experience with use of the model, ease of use of the model and ability to generate the required results.  In addition, other information related to the firm and its financial standing is required.

2. OPTIMIZATION MODEL REQUIREMENTS:

Description:
A planning tool that processes available satellite and aerial image data using computational techniques to automatically generate digital terrain models of optimized railway and highway alignments taking into account costs and other constraints as described herein.  The system must be capable of generating and comparing many alternative alignments which allow planners freedom to balance environmental and socioeconomic factors against costs generated for each alignment.  The model must consider factors during the optimization process which include terrain, geotechnical, geological, hydraulic and environmental concerns along with engineering design criteria and the proximity of existing infrastructure. 

Corridor Alternatives
The model must take into consideration socioeconomic, sociopolitical, environmental, engineering, operational and institutional requirements. The program must generate output documents and maps that can be readily displayed to non-technical persons in workshop sessions enabling the evaluation of corridor preferences.  Progressive scales of resolution will be necessary.

Alignment Selection
The program must evaluate a wide range of alignments within a given route or corridor and provide an optimized alignment which takes into consideration engineering, design, man made and natural obstacles, environmental issues, sociopolitical and socioeconomic issues, quantities and costs.  Output should include defined alignments with material quantities and cost parameters.

The model must have the capability to generate and optimize multiple horizontal and vertical alignments along with the locations and sizes of highway overpasses, bridges, major culverts, retaining walls, cut and fill sections, tunnels, and at-grade road crossings.  

The model should include the following features:

A.  General Capability:
1. Automated alignment optimization and refinement.
2. Able to display singular and multiple alignments.
3. Enable screening evaluation of a broad range of potential alignment and profile options.
4. Be user-friendly for easy use in applications.
5. Able to incorporate professional judgement.
6. Find the optimum alignment with minimum cost taking into consideration; topography, geotechnical and geological conditions, hydrological and hydraulic conditions, environmental impact, socioeconomic, sociopolitical, and socioeconomic factors, and engineering and operational criteria.
7. Able to handle a wide range of corridor and alignment related capital and operating costs. 
8. Able to export to and incorporate highway and railway performance models.
9. Able to identify bridge and tunnel requirements.
10.  Ability to expand plotting for reports, alignment maps, profiles, cross-sections and other pertinent information.
11. Adaptability to use remotely sensed data.
12. Incorporate a watershed model to locate culverts.
13. Ability to function in Imperial units.
14. Automated interface with other programs that compute volumes (Inroads/Intergraph).
15. Ease of conversion and handling available USGS and GIS data.
16. Able to consider rail operational constraints.
17. Able to take into account land use.
18.  The system must incorporate audit trails so that alignments can always be linked to the conditions under which they were created.


B.  Environmental Considerations:

1. The system must be able to locate transport infrastructure horizontally and vertically to meet specified social, environmental and engineering constraints.

2. Once the specified social, environmental and engineering constraints are met the optimization should be cost driven.

3. The environment constraints should include
?h areas from which the alignment can be banned,
?h behavior modifying areas which can be entered subject to constraints on the form of construction and/or elevation,
?h linear features that specify the type of construction and height restrictions for any crossing.

4. Display fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emission estimates for each alignment.

5. Enable comprehensive investigation of alignment options to demonstrate to the stakeholders and local community that alternatives have been investigated.

6. Enable fast, 48 hour, determination of new alignments as and when new environmental or community zones are identified during the consultation process.

7. Because of the multidimensional nature of environmental impacts the system must produce a range of alignments to allow planners and community groups a choice when balancing progress towards different qualitative goals.

C.  Engineering Considerations

1. The alignments should be accurately located so that final adjustments to meet requirements that are a matter of local judgement and preferences will not require the location of the alignment to be shifted by more than a few feet horizontally and less vertically.

2. The costing component of the system should include ability to set unit rates for extraction, transport and placement of material, and construction of structures.

3. The system should balance cut and fill where appropriate.

4. The system must cater for varied geological conditions within corridors including multiple geological zones with multiple strata, and automatic generation of cross section templates, with costs and batter slopes that are a function of strata.

5. The system must produce alignments that meet geometric requirements appropriate to the type of infrastructure.
6. Limiting grades at points or over sustained distances,
7. Limiting radii of curvature on horizontal curves, crests and sags,
8. Coordination of horizontal and vertical curvature to maintain safe sight distances.

9. Display alignments and properties in plan and profile. 

10. Display multiple alignments in plan view.

11. Employ ortho-rectified photographic images as an alternative background when displaying alternative alignments in plan.


 
3. LOCATION OF THE WORK

Work will be performed both off site at the respondents offices, and on-site at the Bechtel SAIC Company, LLC, facilities in Las Vegas, Nevada.

It is necessary, therefore, that the  contractor be located no farther than a nominal 8-hour commute (i.e., ~ 400 miles) from Research Triangle Park(RTP), NC.  EPA source research indicated WVU is uniquely qualified with the necessary facilities, and has the expertise to meet the 40 CFR, Part 86, Subpart N engine certification  requirements as well as being located within the required 400 mile radius.  This notice is not a request for quotations.  However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA requirements may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of completing this work.  Such documentation  must be submitted to the POC withing 15 days of electronic posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose  of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  This acquisition is being processed under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The anticipated award date is October 10, 2002.  See numbered Note 26.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to negotiate on a sole source basis under authority of FAR 6.302 with Raytheon Company, Dallas Texas for the professional services of the study of the potential application of Earth Observation System (EOS) data for disease mitigation.  The period of performance shall be for a base year and one one-year option period.

Specifically, the contractor will conduct the study as follows 1)review existing research, 2) map existing research to current EOS instrument suite, 3) investigate the potential for new linkages between EOS measurements and vector borne disease, and 4) review existing applicable analytical tools.

The NLM determined that Raytheon Company is uniquely qualified to perform the above professional services. Raytheon's experience working with NASA's EOS data spans a time period of almost 10 years and covers a broad set of applications.  Raytheon began working with EOS data in 1993 when it started the task of archiving and disseminating EOS data for EOSDIS. 

Raytheon Company maintains experts staff such as epidemiologists whom have an understanding of how EOS data can be applied to better understand vector-borne diseases, particularly West Nile Virus, Malaria, and Dengue.  In addition, the expert staff has experience working with remote sensing data in environmental applications for over 40 years. 

Finally, Raytheon's support to NASA to develop applications of EOS data through the Synergy Project (www.earth-outlook.com) gives Raytheon a broad perspective on policy and institutional issues in developing EOS remote sensing applications. 

This service will be procured under FAR Part 13 (Simplified Acquisitions.)  This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all responsible and responsive sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the NLM.  Firms interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide the professional technical services as specified above.  Responses should demonstrate the firm?s ability to meet the government?s requirements.  Responses are required within 15 (fifteen) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  NLM synopsis No. 02-226/SAN shall be noted on all correspondence to this announcement.

<DESC>POC:  Evangela Kunene, Procurement Data Manager, Tel:  703-875-4357, Fax:  703-875-4009, E-mail:  ekunene@tda.gov  :  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE  :  Proposal Submission Place:  Operadora Estatal de Aeropuertos, S.A. y/o Consejo Consultivo, Attn: Victor E. Mata Temoltzin, Director General, Sistema Estatal Operadora de Carreteras de Cuota, 11 Poniente 1318, Barrio de Santiago, Puebla, Pue. C.P. 72000, Mexico, Tel: 232 59 06, Fax: 232 73 34, Email: victor_mata@infosel.net.mx  :  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to conduct a feasibility study for Operadora Estatal de Aeropuertos S.A. de C.V.

The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA) has approved a grant to Operadora Estatal de Aeropuertos, S.A. de C.V. (OEA), owned by the Puebla State Government (51%) and the Peralta Group (49%).  OEA began operating the airport in December 2000.  The federal airport operator, Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (ASA) still carries out some administrative functions at the airport and will have either some ownership or guaranteed revenue stream from the airport in exchange for the granting the state government the concession rights.

U.S. carriers Delta and Continental and Mexican carriers Aeromexico, Aeromar and Aerocalifornia operate from the Puebla airport, which handled 133,765 passengers in 2000 and has experienced a steady growth in passenger traffic over the last five years. Although the airport ran significant operational and net losses in 1996, 1997, and 1999, it recently achieved some financial stability and is moderately profitable.  OEA predicts that there will be a 15% yearly increase in air traffic, but the airport is not currently equipped to handle the projected level of demand. 

The feasibility study has two components:  1) modernization of the existing airport infrastructure, including upgrades of the passenger terminal and possibly the runway (the detailed review to determine whether this is necessary will be part of the feasibility study); and 2) installation of an air cargo facility.  

The U.S. firm selected to carry out the feasibility study will be paid in U.S. dollars from a U.S. $550,000 grant to the Grantee from TDA.  

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from TDA, at 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, TDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm?s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want TDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to TDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to TDA before scheduling a pick-up.  Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, TDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling TDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this TDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under TDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the TDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the TDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the TDA grant amount.  Details of TDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English and Spanish directly to the Grantee by 4:00p.m., local time Puebla Mexico, October 30, 2002 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>Subscription Service for Worldwide Standards and Vendor Data on the Internet. Issue date 11 Sep 02. Closing date 26 Sep 02. AFMETCAL Det 1 intends to award a sole-source purchase order utilizing simplified acquisition procedures to Information Handling Services. The proposed procurement under Reference Number F6683L22190100 is for Information Handling Service Subscription Service for Worldwide Standards and Vendor Data on the Internet. The IHS Subscription Service consists of two parts: Vendor Oriented Data and Standards Oriented Data. The Vendor Oriented Data consists of Catalog Xpress services which gives immediate access to over 16,000 prime manufacturers catalogs.  The Standards Oriented Data consists of the current DOD and Civilian Standards.  Supplies and/or services are available from only one source.  No other type of supply and/or service will satisfy agency requirements. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to meet the requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  If no written response is received at AFMETCAL by 26 Sep 02, to the effect that comparable supplies/services are available that would be more advantageous to the Government than obtaining these supplies/services through a sole-source procurement with Information Handling Service, a sole-source award will be made.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>SOLICITATION NOTICE:   The Robert N. Giaimo Federal Building contains approximately 10,955 gross square meters (117,924 GSF) of interior space.  The facility consists of a seven story modern style building with a two-level underground parking garage with loading docks (approximately 50,000 GSF). The work within this project shall include, but not be limited to: Alterations to building fenestration (curtain wall) and refurbishing of the exterior facade; upgrade of accessibility to meet the requirements under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA); Structural upgrades for current seismic and wind load requirements.  Additional components of the project include: alteration of egress balconies; renovation of all interior tenant areas, restrooms and lobbies; correction of code deficiencies; hazardous material mitigation/abatement; upgrading of all elevators; upgrading of plumbing, fire protection; mechanical, electrical and security systems equipment; 
The facility will be occupied throughout the project. Construction will be conducted in several phases to accommodate continued occupancy of the building. Approximately one floor shall remain vacant in order to facilitate this work.  The successful firm must have previous experience with similar size and scope of construction projects with particular emphasis on complex multi-phased occupied renovations & alterations. GSA has defined similar size and scope to be: renovation of an occupied office building (Governmental, Courthouse, or Institutional) of approximately $10 million dollars or more and/or phased construction renovation projects in occupied buildings of approximately $10 million dollars or more that involve the removal of hazardous materials. The contractor's personnel will be required to obtain security clearances prior to working on this project. The approximate duration of the contract is 30 months. This project is designed using metric units and the estimated cost is more than ten million dollars ($10,000,000).  Award will be a firm fixed price contract and the procurement method will be a competitive negotiated Request for Proposal (RFP). Source Selection Procedures as identified in FAR PART 15.3 will be utilized in the selection of a firm offering the ?best value? to the Government in terms of price and technical merit,  and whose performance is expected to best meet stated Government requirements. Accordingly, offerors will be evaluated based on technical merit with respect to demonstrated successful past performance, qualified/experienced personnel, management plan/technical approach,  subcontracting opportunities, and on their price proposals.
The acquisition process shall consist of five phases: Phase 1- receipt and evaluation of technical proposals utilizing a draft RFP with the technical evaluation factors. Phase 2 - development of an advisory short list based on technical qualifications/proposals of the most technically qualified firms. In this stage, GSA will advise each respondent that participates in Phase 1, in writing, as to whether or not they will be invited to participate in Phase 3, or that they are unlikely to be a viable competitor. GSA will advise the responding firms considered not to be viable competitors, and the basis of GSA's opinion. GSA will inform all respondents that not withstanding the advice provided by GSA in response to their submission in Phase 1, they may participate in Phase 3. Phase 3- receipt and evaluation of price proposals based on 100% construction documents (a competitive range will then be developed by the Contracting Officer). Phase 4 - oral presentations and interviews of firms in the competitive range. Phase 5 negotiations and receipt and evaluation of final offers. Upon receipt and evaluation of all technical and price proposals, a formal selection of a firm will be made that offers the greatest value to the Government based on a combination of technical evaluation and price factors. Failure of offerors to submit a technical offer during Phase 1 will preclude further participation on this acquisition. For this procurement, technical evaluation factors are equal to price related factors. The Government has reserved the right to make an award at completion of Phase 4. The technical factors for the evaluation process are, in descending order of importance: 
1. Past Performance, 
2. Management and technical approach to completing
    phased/building occupied construction projects.
3  Qualifications and Experience of Key Personnel.
4. Subcontracting Plan including management control, quality 
    assurance, coordination and small business category goals.

<DESC>The purpose of this notification is to amend synopsis/ solicitation number N00173-02-R-RS03 for a Pedestal Tracking Mount, previously posted in the FBO on 29 April 2002. This amendment is numbered 0001. The purpose of this amendment is to revise the RFP closing date, correct a clerical error in the text, and respond to technical and business questions posed against the original synopsis/solicitation.  The closing date for Synopsis/ Solicitation Number N00173-02-R-RS03 is hereby extended to 29 MAY 2002.  Reference to Federal Acquisition Circular 01-03 is hereby deleted and replaced with "Federal Acquisition Circular 01-07".  Question 1: How many units are required?  
Answer 1: One (1).  
Question 2: Is it in our favor to propose a shorter delivery time? Answer 2: Delivery time may be proposed for any time prior to the required delivery date specified in the RFP.
Question 3: Does the total weight include the controller?
Answer 3: Total weight does not include the controller.
Question 4: Are there any shock and vibration requirements?
Answer 4: No.
Question 5: Is the system open to the environment?  Can you specify the conditions? (Wind, snow, rain, ice, salt, humidity?)
Answer 5: The Government anticipates that the system will be primarily indoors. Occasionally, the system will be taken to an outdoor range, where it will be protected from adverse weather but may be subject to humidity from 20% to 90% and wind up to 25 mph.
Question 6: What are the physical dimensions of the balanced load?
Answer 6: Typical IR camera ex Radiance camera from Raytheon - 6 inches x 6 inches x 12 inches
Question 7: What are the contract quality requirements?
Answer 7: See Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.212-4 for Inspection and Acceptance requirements and Warranty requirements.
Question 8: Is it the Government's intent to have the operator manually acquire and track a target up to 500-degrees/sec velocity if the tracking system is not exercised?
Answer 8: 500 deg/sec squared is an acceleration requirement, not a velocity requirement.
Question 9: Are any transportation or shipping cases required?
Answer 9: No.
Question 10: When does NRL anticipate awarding the contract?
Answer 10: Undetermined at this time.  Date of award will be based on the number of proposals received, the time required to perform evaluations, and other factors that cannot be accurately projected at this time.
Question 11: Does NRL have a not-to-exceed budget for this requirement, including options?
Answer 11: Yes, but, as stated in the original RFP, technical considerations and past performance are of greater importance than price for the purpose of proposal evaluation.
Question 12:  Are the specifications based on a currently available product, or are they derived from the user mission statement?
Answer 12: The specifications are derived from requirements.
Question 13: The solicitation states that a small business is 750 employees.  I thought a small business was 500 employees or less.  Has this changed?
Answer 13: The definition of what constitutes a small business varies between the different NAICS codes.  In certain cases, the number of employees is the determining criteria.  In other cases, dollar income is the determining factor.  Please reference the current NAICS codes.
Question 14: There is no NSN listed.  Is this a COTS procurement or is there any development involved?
Answer 14: The Government anticipates this to be a COTS procurement.
Question 15:  Is it an absolute requirement for 3 references to which the same or similar products have been delivered within the last two years?
Answer 15: See Federal Acquisition Regulations 15.305(a)(2)(iv).
Question 16: Is the tracker meant for shipboard use?
Answer 16: See Answer 5, above.
Question 17: Is the tracking accuracy and angular resolution specification a hard requirement?
Answer 17: Yes
Question 18: What is the power requirement?
Answer 18: None

<DESC>The purpose of this notification is to amend synopsis/ solicitation number N00173-02-R-RS03 for a Pedestal Tracking Mount, previously posted in the FBO on 29 April 2002. This amendment is numbered 0003. The purpose of this amendment is to respond to technical and business questions posed against the original synopsis/solicitation, and to extend the closing date. The closing date of the solicitation is hereby extended to 03 JUN 2002.

Question 1: The stated Target acceleration is 500 degrees/ sec/sec. How long does the target accelerate before reaching maximum velocity?  In the Manual Mode, it is stated, the Pedestal will be slaved to an external source. At what data rate will the pointing information be transferred to the pedestal in the slave mode? What is the accuracy of the external pointing system?  What is the size and contrast of the target and how far from the target is the tracking site, i.e. geometry of the test? Is a profile of the target velocity and acceleration available? Are the velocity and acceleration values for both Azimuth and Elevation? Are the maximum target velocity and acceleration values referenced to the tracking site or the target? 
Answer 1:  The gimbal shall be capable of getting up to maximum track capability in approximately 150 milliseconds upon command. The specification provided in RFP Number N00173-02-R-RS03 is for the gimbal rather than the optional camera tracker.  The Government is willing to look at any and all camera/tracker systems of varying performance that are proposed.
Question 2:  Further clarification of the evaluation factor criteria, i.e. what percentage weighting do each of the three evaluation factors carry?
Answer 2:  The Government is only required to notify offerors of the relative importance of each evaluation criteria.  See the original synopsis/solicitation for the ordinal ranking associated with this acquisition.

No other changes are made in the synopsis/solicitation.
echnical point of contact?
Answer 19:  It is not appropriate to do so at this time.
Question 20: Can you provide physical, electrical, and optical performance data (i.e., focal length- fixed or zoom) for the visible video camera option?  Is it correct to assume that this option includes the automatic video tracker electronics (AVTE)?
Answer 20: 6 deg FOV fixed.  Yes for the AVTE.
Question 21: (a) Is it correct to assume that the track head is the portion of the tracking mount that provides the azimuth and elevation motion for the payload?  (b) What is the width requirements for the tracking head?  Are there height, width, and weight requirements for the pedestal portion of the tracking mount?  (c) Is it correct to assume that the pedestal is just a barbette/post to support the tracking mount?
Answer 21: (a) Yes. (b) No width requirement. No requirement on pedestal.  The Government desires that the whole system be about 42-inches tall (to the center of az/el axes). (c) Yes, pedestal is just a post.
Question 22: Can the total azimuth travel of 180 degrees be interpreted as +/- 90 degrees?  Can the total elevation travel be interpreted as +/- 37.5 degrees?
Answer 22: Yes to both questions.

No other changes are made in the synopsis/solicitation.

This amendment is numbered 0002. The purpose of this amendment is to respond to technical and business questions posed against the original synopsis/solicitation.  
Question 1: Is it the Government's intent to operate the system in a slaved mode of operation?
Answer 1: The system will be a custom-built IR camera and tracker electronics system.  It will be similar to the visible camera and tracker called for in the option.  It is anticipated that the custom electronics will need the same interface that would be provided by the option tracker.
Question 2: The 6 degree FOV with a typical CCD camera yields an IFOV of 139 uradians.  This is not consistent with a < 50 uradian tracking capability, assuming a 1 pixel AVT tracking accuracy.  In order to meet the required tracking accuracy either a megapixel camera or a longer focal length lens with a smaller FOV would have to be used.  Please comment on this.
Answer 2: The specification for the pedestal is the driving factor for this acquisition.  The pedestal, with or without tracker, shall be capable of the 50 microrads requirement.  Offerors should provide a cost effective FOV which is consistent with the specification.

No other changes are made in the synopsis/solicitation.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command is in the planning stage of a
procurement for the replacement for its current Unit Level 
Circuit Switch (UCLS) equipment. The Transition Switch Module 
(TSM) will provide commercially available circuit switching
technology to replace the aging TRI-TAC family of equipment
(AN/TTC-42 adn SB-3865).  It will provide all of the services
currently available in USMC switching equipment in a smaller, 
lighter package.  Additionally, the TSM will provide enhanced 
multiplexing capabilities and an Integrated Services Digital
Network (ISDN) capability.  The TSM will provide a flexible 
Unit Level Switch capability that bridges legacy TRI-TAC 
switches with current commercial technology to provide Marine
maneuver elements with more robust voice/data switching, 
data transport, and bandwith management capabilities.  The
TSM is anticipated to be a three transit case solution that
will be fielded to all units that currently have a circuit
switching capability (Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF) and
Major Subordinate Command (MSC) through Regiment).  To
facilitate planning efforts, the program office will host an
Industry Day on 17 October 2002 at 0900 in Building 3300,
3rd floor (MCCDC Auditorium), MCCDC, Quantico, VA 22134.
The Government will provide an overview of the TSM program.
In addition, the Government will schedule, with interested 
parties, one-on-one meetings tentatively scheduled for the
period 13-15 November 2002 at Building 2079 (Daly Hall).  
To asist in the development of the Purchase Description and 
the Statement of Work for the TSM, the Government is seeking 
information on current state-of-the art technologies from
industry that may enhance TSM capabilities.  Accordingly, the 
Government desires to meet with technical personnel capable
of presenting information that may enhance the capabilities
of the TSM.  The Government will not entertain sales, marketing,
and/or corporate capability briefs.  Each meeting will last no
more than 2 hours.  Due to space limitations, interested parties
are requested to limit attendance to no more than 3 people.  
Interested parties should submit a written response, on corporate
letter head, to the following address:  COMMANDER, MARCORSYSCOM,
2033 Barnett Ave., Code CTQIDP, ATTN:  Ira D. Patterson, 
Quantico, VA 22134-5010.

<DESC>The Air Force Metrology Calibration Detachment is considering the purchase of twenty (20) Triple Point of Water Maintenance Systems.  This item will consist of an apparatus and Triple Point of Water Cell that will allow the PMELS to create and maintain the Triple Point of Water (TPW) for temperature calibrations for a period of time very efficiently and accurately.  This method would require only minimal operator time and no external mediums or solutions to initiate the freeze.  The TPW is one of the primary temerature reference points on the new Temperature Scale, ITS-90.  This item will be used to verify the lab's Primary Temperature Reference Standard, the SPRT (Standard Platinum Resistance Thermometer) before and after each use.  The TPW measurement is important since it is the reference point from which all further temperature calibrations are compared with.  Used in this way, the TPW can verify the SPRT has drifted due to time, handling, or shipment.  Also, the TPW Maintenance System can be used in other temperature calibrations that previously required the calibration technician to make an ice bath using distilled ice/water and an insulated dewar.  The TPW shall be manufactured and maintained in the same apparatus.  this procedure shall take place with minimum user intervention and without the use of external agents.  Common size TWP cells up to 13 cm in length or 'mini' TPW cells around 9mm in length can be used. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.

<DESC>The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Office of Acquisition Management, in response to a requirement from the DEA's Office of Resource Management (FR) is looking for a relational database structure (COTS or COTS with minimal customization) that will integrate budget formulation and budget execution into one system.  

1) The budget formulation section must allow for development (data entry screens for numeric and text characters along with automated calculations, web-based) of the budget request via position cost modules at the appropriation, program office, object class,  personnel type level.  The system must provide tracking of budget resources through the budget cycle, by budget submission and fiscal year, allowing for "relationship" changes within and between budget submissions (e.g. Spring Call, OMB, Congressional submissions) and for "relationship" changes within and between fiscal years.  The formulation section must contain a report generating capability that provides structured reports ("canned" reports with specified formats) as well as adhoc reporting with a dynamic structure that can be adjusted as field sizes and characters expand and contract.  There must be interface capabilities allowing for downloaded data from other internal and external automated systems and the system must allow for exportation of data to MS Excel.

2) The budget execution section must track from the formulation section to the Financial Plan development, including a mechanism for allocating funds to a specified level and the tracking and adjustment of those funds.  The execution section must contain a report generating capability that provides structured reports ("canned" reports with specified formats) as well as adhoc reporting with a dynamic structure that can be adjusted as field sizes and characters expand and contract.
There must be interface capabilities allowing for downloaded data from other internal and external automated systems and the system must allow for exportation of data to MS Excel.

Depending on the systems proposed, the system shall be able to interface with DEA's accounting system (FFS), personnel system, and other internal databases.  DEA/FR currently has an MS Access database requiring migration of data from this into the new system.

For more background, attached is FR's mission statement that lists our responsibilities and projects.

The system will be accessed via the DEA's intranet, "Firebird". Therefore, the attached "Do's and Don't's for Developers" must be considered when proposing a system.  The system must be capable of passing Firebird integration and performance testing.  The system would be accessed by (to begin with) 10-15 users with data input capabilities and at least 25 others with view only.  DEA should be able to set passwords and change/set levels of access within the system.  Program Managers at DEA would have separate views of their own data with possible upload and download capabilities between their offices and FR.  

Interested parties should provide the contracting office, no later than October 7, 2002, evidence of their capability to provide this system and a positive statement of their eligibility as a small business under NAICS 541512.  If adequate interest is not received from small business concerns, the solicitation will be issued, without further notice, as unrestricted.  All interested parties shall respond to this notice in writing.  No telephone responses will be accepted.

<DESC>This is a notice to all  Passport and Visa Expediting Service Providers located within the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area.  This is not a RFQ and there will be no resulting contract.  The National Science Foundation (NSF) is a Federal government agency located in Ballston area of Arlington, VA.  Companies that are located not more than one hour from NSF in Arlington, Virginia are invited to attend a vendor fair.   

We are seeking the services of passport and visa service companies and wish to hold a "vendor fair" so that our staff can meet with you and find out what services you offer.  Basically, we will require services such as obtaining personal and government passports, securing visas, and advice and information about foreign travel and travel restrictions.  Regarding our government passport process, we have a simplified process that is currently handled through our travel contractor.  However, in the future, we wish to have our government passports expedited by professional passport services.  NSF will pay for passport expediting services through the use of the government VISA travel card.

If you wish to attend the vendor fair, we will provide sufficient space for you to meet with NSF customers.  Since you supply your services through the Internet, we suggest that you demonstrate your website.  Also, please bring handouts, brochures and price lists, as available, for our customers.  We will provide Internet connectivity and laptops.  The vendor fair will be held on October 21, 2002  from 9:30 am to 12:30 pm in room 375 at the NSF headquarters at 4201 Wilson Boulevard, Arlington, VA  22230.

<SUBJECT>B -- GUIDES FOR THE SELECTION OF COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL EQUIPMENT FOR EMERGENCY FIRST RESPONDERS
<DESC>NEW AND UPDATED CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL DEFENSE EQUIPMENT INFORMATION NEEDED - GUIDES FOR THE SELECTION OF COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL EQUIPMENT FOR EMERGENCY FIRST RESPONDERS DUE 10/10/02 POC Dr. Al Fatah, Office of Law Enforcement Standards, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), E-MAIL: POC, alim.fatah@nist.gov.  The heightened national concern that terrorists will employ chemical agents, toxic industrial materials (TIMs), and/or biological agents against domestic targets has prompted State and local first responders to enhance their response capabilities.  In recognizing the needs of State and local emergency first responders, the Department of Justice has funded a program responsible for the development of chemical and biological defense equipment guides.  The guides focus on chemical and biological equipment in areas of detection, personal protection, decontamination, and communication.  Initial versions of these guides were recently issued by the National Institute of Justice.  To ensure that these guides remain a valuable tool to State and local first responders, they must be periodically updated.  Based upon this need, this notice was prepared as the initial step necessary to begin these updates.  Electronic read-only versions of each guide are located at http://virlib.ncjrs.org/LawEnforcement.asp.  Specific areas of interest include identification of equipment items that have been recently developed and/or upgraded since the initiation of the original guides, using the same set of stated criteria as used for the original guides.  Sources are asked to contact by e-mail the NIST POC for any potential questions, as well as their responses.  The deadline for response to this notice is 30 days from the date of this announcement.

<SUBJECT>Institute for Healthcare Inprovement Membership
<DESC>The Stratton VA Medical Center, Albany, NY intends to issue a sole source contract to the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI), 375 Longwood Avenue, Boston, MA 02215.  IHI is a non-profit organization created to help lead the improvement of health care systems, to continuously increase quality and valu500/2-90NCA.e.  Measures of improvement include improved health status, better clinical outcomes, lower cost, broadened access, greater ease of use, and higher satisfaction for individuals and their communities.  IMPACT, IHI=92s new action network, will organize the front-line improvement work around broad, action-oriented topic areas called Domains.  The Stratton VAMC has selected Office Practices and Outpatient Settings.  The Geriatrics & Extended Care (GEC) Care line will focus on elderly patients that are subjected to preventive health care measures and chronic disease management protocols that are based upon recommendations from various health care associations and professional societies. Collaboration and patient outcomes are the cornerstones of IMPACT membership.  An IMPACT Action Team is a front-line, cross-functional work group, formed for the purpose of making dramatic positive change in Preventive Medicine in Chronic Care Guidelines.  In collaboration with teams from other organizations and with the guidance of an internationally recognized faculty of experts assembled by IHI, the Action Team will live on the cutting edge of improvement by continuously cultivating and testing new ideas, sharing and deploying best practices, linking enabling technologies to the work in useful and cost-effective ways. IHI will orchestrate and customize an array of events and activities through which the Action Team will learn change concepts, focus improvement work, and get results.  These include collaborative improvement projects, International Summits, and Calls to Action audio conferences. Participants in each Domain will assemble several times each year to share learning and propel the Domain's collaborative improvement agenda.  This cross learning will ensure integration of the organization's business priorities with the work of the front-line improvement teams.  In addition, all Action Team members will share Domain-specific ideas throughout the year using a variety of electronic media, the IHI extranet, conference calls with IHI directors, moderated discussions with International experts, and other activities to stay connected. The period of performance will be for one year.  The basis for the proposed non-competitive action is to be able to work with other health care organizations, through IHI, to show that system-wide efforts are feasible and through such efforts, set new benchmarks for healthcare quality and safety.  The VA was part of a national contract for IHI in the past with great results including decreased waiting times and increased quality customer service and no other possesses the capability to satisfy this requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes however; any firm any firm that believes it can meet the requirements may give written notification to the contracting officer within seven days from the date of publication of this synopsis.  Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements.  Information can be sent to Michael C. Brennan, 500/2-90NCA Network Contracting Officer VA Healthcare Network Upstate New York, Stratton VA Medical Center, 113 Holland Avenue, Albany, New York 12208.
