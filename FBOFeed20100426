Hard copies of this solicitation are NOT available. This is an unrestricted procurement.

Specifications, plans or drawings are not available.

Based upon market research, the Government is using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, as well as policies contained in Part 13.5 in its solicitation for the described supplies. Because this has been determined as a commercial item, and because of high priority backorders, this procurement is being issued concurrently with the synopsis.

<DESC>This is Pre-Solicitation Notice for Solicitation SP040001D9406-R-0241. The VPV Corporate Contract to which[50] NSNs on this Synopsis Notice are intended to be added is the Boeing St. Louis VPV Corporate Contract No.: [SP0400-01-D-9406]; [Current Awardee Cage: [0PXV4]; Former Awardee Cage on original Contract Award [76301]. Contract Issue Date: 02 May, 2001; Contract Expiration Date: 01 May 11.  This Contract is an IQC Type Contract with One (01) 3-Year Base Period [Firm Fixed Price], Two (02) Two-Year Option Periods [1st: Fixed Price/EPA; 2nd: Corporate Contracting Price Redetermination - Alternate I]; and One (01) 3-year Option Period [Corporate Contracting Price Redetermination - Alternate I].

The addition of these new cages was, and still is, designated to allow for expedient, effective, comprehensive, and streamlined coverage for any U.S. Service Weapon or Weapon System.

<CONTACT>Susan Nsangou, Phone 3014432104, Email nsangous@mail.nih.gov
<DESC>This is a notice of intent, not a request for a proposal. A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested. The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Station Support/Simplified Acquisition (SS/SA) Branch on behalf of the National Institute of Aging (NIA) intends to solicit, negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to Jul Lea Shamy, 72 Seaman Avenue, New York, NY for the services for the study of age-related deficits in cognitive function which compromise the quality of life and are among the most troubling consequences of growing older. A major line of research in the Neurocognitive Aging Section (NAS) of the Laboratory of Experimental Gerontology is aimed at establishing a nonhuman primate model for defining the basis of normal cognitive aging. An important goal of these studies is to develop a detailed and sensitive framework for testing the working hypothesis that age-related decline results from large-scale restructuring of the neural networks that support normal memory. Toward this end, subjects receive periodic high resolution, structural MRI and corresponding [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET scans, over the course of neuropsychological testing. Metabolic activity in the prefrontal cortex and medial temporal lobe system is then evaluated in relation to individual variability in the cognitive outcome of aging. The imaging data are also subject to Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) analysis, providing a nonbiased, whole-brain mapping of age-related metabolic change.
<p>As part of her Ph.D. research, Dr. Jul Lea Shamy conducted several novel in vivo brain imaging studies utilizing our nonhuman primate model of cognitive aging. Key findings included the observation that the volume of the hippocampus is largely preserved under conditions where the confounding influence of neurodegenerative disease can be excluded, even among subjects with documented deficits in hippocampal memory function (Shamy et al., 2006). By comparison, certain signatures of cognitive aging in monkeys appear associated with broader, network scale alterations distributed across multiple memory-related brain regions (Alexander et al., 2008). Ongoing NAS studies require this established expertise in imaging analysis in nonhuman primate models of cognitive aging. In this project Dr. Shamy will perform post-acquisition image processing and analysis of structural MRI images from behaviorally characterized young and aged monkeys. This analysis may include both region-of-interest and voxel-based approaches for identifying brain markers of normal cognitive aging. The MRI scans will also provide anatomical localization for FDG PET data, providing a reflection of potential metabolic change in the aged brain. Dr. Shamy has extensive expertise in image analysis in relation to cognitive aging in the monkey, and her support will be critical to the success of our ongoing studies.

<DESC>The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is currently posting a synopsis for an upcoming solicitation for a requirement to support the Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) Environmental Fate and Effects Division (EFED) for activities supporting the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) and the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA). Specifically, support is required in four general areas: reviewing and evaluating studies provided by registrants or found in open literature searches; producing assessments; reviewing submitted risk assessments; and developing or improving risk assessment methods. In addition support is required to provide training for EPA staff on issues related to the science and methods of risk assessment. Workshop organization and facilitation will also be required.  Although capability in all of these areas is required, the primary focus of the contract will be on the evaluation of studies.
It is anticipated that the solicitation will be available on or about May 11, 2010. Proposals will be due approximately 30 days after the solicitation becomes available. The proposed requirement is a total small business set-aside. The contractor shall be prepared to provide scientific/technical support for EPA activities in furtherance of the Agency's primary mission, the protection of human health and the environment. The PWS falls under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541620 and the applicable size standard is $7.0 million. 
The resultant contract is anticipated to be Cost Plus Fixed Fee with a 12-month base period and the possibility of four 12-month option periods. Work may be ordered through the issuance of work assignments. The contractor shall provide all personnel, materials, and equipment necessary to perform the PWS. 
The contractor is required to comply with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14 Limitations on Subcontracting (Dec. 1998). Small Businesses must sufficiently demonstrate the ability to perform at least 50% of the cost associated with labor of any resultant contract and more specifically capability in the technical aspects of performing under a government contract. 
In order to be awarded a contract under this requirement, a contractor and any sub-contractors who will possibly require access to FIFRA confidential business information (CBI) must have the ability to receive and maintain FIFRA clearance. In addition, the contractor must demonstrate their ability to obtain FIFRA clearance. For additional information on the requirements of the FIFRA Clearance refer to the FIFRA Security Manual which will be available at the website below.
All associated documents are posted on the following webpage http://www.epa.gov/oamhpod1/oppts_grp/1010020/index.htm.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

This surveillance will determine whether security Guard Force contract performance requirements are in compliance with the contract Performance Requirements Summary/Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan. The intention of this notice is to survey the market for potential offerors.  Questions regarding this requirement must be submitted in writing and directed to Doris Vaughn, Contract Specialist, 6011 Executive Blvd. Room 539B, Rockville Md  20852.  Questions must be received by May 3rd 2010.  Interested Companies responding to the market survey must provide capability statement demonstrating their experience, skills and capability to fulfill the Governments requirements for the above request.  A copy of the capability statement must be received at the address, 6011 Executive Blvd., Room 539B, Rockville Md. 20852.


I.   Purpose:

The intent of this Statement of Objectives is to secure a vendor that will provide the full range of services needed and original approaches for performing surveillance of the contract security guard services at various locations throughout the National Institutes of Health (NIH), on and off campus in the local area (Washington-Baltimore). This surveillance will determine whether security Guard Force contract performance requirements are in compliance with the contract Performance Requirements Summary/Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan. 

Ia.  Scope:
The NIH seeks a contractor who is knowledgeable in surveillance techniques and has not less than five years experience in the field of Quality Assurance Inspections/Surveillance as related to the security field and performance based contracts. The contractor will be tasked with staffing and conducting around the clock (24/7) inspections/surveillance of the NIH contractor guard force delivery of services. These inspections will consist of random, scheduled and unscheduled inspections, conducted during all hours of the day and night, including holidays, weekends, and periods of inclement weather. Inspections/surveillance will be performed at all NIH facilities in the local area (Washington-Baltimore) that have contract Guard forces assigned. Surveillance findings will be reported by the Division of Amenities and Transportation Services (DATS) to the NIH Contracting Officers Technical Representative (COTR) and to the NIH Division of Police (DP) via telephone, e-mail, written reports, in-person or any combination thereof. Regardless of the type of notification, all events/surveillance activities will be followed up by adding the findings into an electronic data file.  There are currently 23 separate posts on campus and 20 off campus sites with contract Guards assigned. Several of these sites are staffed with contract Guards 24 hours a day. For purposes of this solicitation, a staff of three full time inspectors has been sufficient in the past for this assignment. The location and the number of posts are subject to change and the vendor should anticipate traveling to new locations as necessary. Included in the inspection process will be surreptitious attempts to penetrate the various levels of the contractors security at perimeter vehicle entrances, and building entrances using methods which should be readily detected by alert guards trained by the contractor and NIH. Vehicle inspection processes and procedures will also be monitored as defined in the Guard Force Quality Assurance Performance Requirements (Attachment Number 2) as well as other performance measures. The contractor will also conduct inspections of administrative tasks as required (i.e., reports, schedules, etc.).  Contract Guard Force performance monitoring will be conducted at any NIH facility with contract Guard personnel assigned, on- and off-campus in the Washington-Baltimore area. The contractor will document their performance daily of all evaluations and locations by adding their data to one or more electronic databases/datafiles. The contractor will be tasked with completing reports. Report formats will be provided or the contractor may propose a report format of their own with the concurrence of the COTR. The contractor should practice effective resource management as part of their daily work effort. The contractor surveillance personnel may be required to provide additional support of their findings during legal proceedings if required.  This may include testimony at court proceedings, affidavits, depositions, administrative type meetings, etc.

The Government has the unilateral right to order services in excess of those specified in this solicitation that falls within the scope of performance of the services that are identified as additional security requirements are required.

	direct or negotiate any changes in the Solicitation or specifications
	modify or extend the period of performance
	change the delivery schedule
	change any terms and conditions of the contract.

NIH Project Officer

Performance Requirements Summary (PRS)  
A matrix with:

	A column for each of the following four critical elements: required services, performance standards, acceptable quality levels and NIH monitoring method.

	A final row listing the strategic contract incentives (positive or negative) that are linked to achieving the proposed performance standards.  The PRS serves as the basis for the performance work statement.

Performance standards
Performance standards establish the performance level required by the Government to meet the contract requirements. The standards shall be measurable and structured to permit an assessment of the contractors performance. 

Performance Work Statement (PWS)

A PWS may be prepared by the Government or result from a Statement of Objectives (SOO) prepared by the Government where the Contractor proposes the PWS. 

Statement of Objectives (SOO) - a Government-prepared document incorporated into the solicitation that states the overall performance objectives. It is used in solicitations when the Government intends to provide the maximum flexibility to each contractor to propose an innovative approach.  The purpose of a SOO is to provide contractors with maximum flexibility to conceive and propose innovative approaches and solutions. It is provided in the solicitation in lieu of a Government-written work statement. In this approach, the contractors' quotes contain work statements and performance metrics and measures (which are based on their proposed solutions and existing commercial practices).

<DESC>NOAA's Acquisition &amp; Grants Office, Western Acquisition Division-Boulder, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with the Boulder History Museum in Boulder, CO to coordinate with middle-school students to produce videos of oral histories of NOAA science. The videos will be short stories/oral histories of NOAA science documenting historical discoveries and research in atmospheric sciences conducted in Boulder since the 1950s.
<p>Background: This multimedia, multigenerational project will introduce MESA (Math, Engineering and Science Achievement) program students to the Boulder community's world-class scientists to capture stories, via videos, for NOAA and the community. The sole source determination is based on NOAA's need to contract with the Boulder History Museum because the museum initiated the idea and conducted Phase One of the Bolder History project. The period of performance is June 2010 through January 2011.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe they can provide equipment that fully meets the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact within 10 days after publication of this synopsis. Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has emerging requirements and applications which require the use of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) technology.  The systems have the potential to support a wide range of civil applications including emergency response, environmental monitoring, addressing land management issues, and assessing the impact of climate change.   This roadmap will initiate the translation of the benefit of UAS and technologies by mapping specific unmanned system capabilities to specific USGS and Department of Interior (DOI) mission areas. This roadmap will be designed to address the following areas:  1) compile a list of current and potential applications of UAS technology by USGS and DOI bureau partners; 2) provide an overview of current and planned UAS capabilities with special emphasis on U.S. Department of Defense Programs of Record; 3) discuss the availability of sensor capabilities available for each class of UAS:  Full Motion Video, Thermal, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Chemical- Biological-Radiological, communication relays, LiDAR, Hyperspectral, MultiSpectral, etc. 4) discuss the analytical tools available to exploit and analyze information collected via UAS technology; 5) develop a high level concept of operations for archiving and distributing the data acquired by UAS technology; 6) discuss the regulatory environment (Federal Aviation Administration and DOI Aviation Management Directorate) rules and regulations governing the operations of UAS in the National Air Space; 7) discuss the potential evolution and availability of UAS technology in 2025. The USGS is in search of small business firms who are able to perform the above mentioned services.  Small business firms who feel they can furnish the required services are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement.  An affirmative response would include literature, brochures and such other materials, which correspond to the required services stated herein.   This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist.

The Marine Corps' most desirable attributes for a new shelter are listed below:a)	Shall be made of water-resistant and mildew-resistant materials that meet the flame spread ASTM-D6413-08, CPAI-84 or equivalent, and meet current visual and near-infrared (Night Vision Goggle) detection military standard;b)	Floor space (from 275 square feet to 305 square feet) to accommodate 15 Marines lying down and the Space Heater Arctic (SHA) system (NSN:  4520-01-444-2375);c)	When erected, shall have sufficient headroom for Marines to stand and don and doff clothing (height at apex between 74.5 inches and 78.0 inches);d)	Shelter System weight between (51 pounds and 76 pounds);e)	Operate in temperatures ranging from (-25F to 120F (Threshold), -40F to 120F (Objective));f)	Provide interoperability with the SHA system;g)	Withstand high winds and blowing winds to a minimum of (50 mph steady and 55 mph gusts, respectively), and provide protection from driving rain to a minimum of (20 mph/2 inches per hour) for a minimum of (15 minutes) and snow to a minimum of (4 pounds per square foot);h)	Reversible exterior fabric (arctic white in color on one (1) side and woodland camouflage pattern in color on the opposite side);i)	Removable, optional, water-resistant, full ground floor, with one (1) floor portal/hatch, with closure, to accommodate the SHA system (NSN:  4520-01-444-2375);j)	Provide ventilation at a minimum of (4 feet) above the shelter floor to reduce the interior build-up of condensation while maintaining blackout capability;k)	Contain an anchoring system and ground skirts/gutters to secure the shelter in both snow and alpine environments with high wind conditions;l)	Provide windows for light and 2 hatches that can interconnect from tent-to-tent and enable Marines in full cold weather combat gear to enter/exit the shelter unencumbered;m)	Require no special tools for erecting and striking; n)	Supplied with a field expedient repair kit.
For planning purposes, the Marine Corps may purchase an estimated minimum of 200 shelters to an estimated maximum of 2,400 shelters.  However, exact quantity and funding availability are still to be determined.
Vendors who believe they have a product capable of meeting these requirements are requested to provide 2 copies of the following:  product literature, brochures, test data (if available), price lists, warranty coverage, capability, past-performance, and any other relevant information.  The Berry Amendment will apply to any contractual instruments that may result based on the information provided in these responses.
In addition to the information requested above, vendors are requested to provide information regarding business size to evaluate whether it would be appropriate to issue any future solicitations for an Arctic Shelter System as a total small business set-aside under the authority of FAR Part 19.502-2, Total Small Business Set-Asides, or as an Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) small business set-aside under authority of FAR Part 19.1305, HUBZone Set-Aside Procedures.

Interested parties shall also be able to meet the requirements of FAR Part 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting.  Therefore, capabilities statements shall also state whether the shelter is being wholly manufactured by the interested party submitting the response or whether the shelter is being manufactured by a different vendor or vendors.  If the proposed shelter is being manufactured by other vendor(s), the response shall identify those vendor(s) and the percentage of the cost they are responsible for in regards to manufacturing the item.

<CONTACT>Steven Streeter, 508-233-5704

<a href="mailto:steve.streeter@us.army.mil">RDECOM Contracting Center - Natick R&D (RDECOM-CC)</a>
<DESC>Introduction:  Pursuant to FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b)(1), the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, on behalf of the Naval Health Research Center (NHRC), intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order on a sole source basis to: University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093.<BR><BR>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  <BR><BR>NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT IS AVAILABLE. <BR> <BR>1. Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs: <BR><BR>The Naval Health Research Center (NHRC) requires supplies/services to support the research project titled Neural Markers of Loss of Situation Awareness (Phase 3) which will include/require core experiments, EEG hardware, expert advice on the transition of technology, computational data analysis and the analysis of data interpretation. <BR><BR>2. A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights, etc.): <BR><BR>This project has two major thrusts: (1) understanding military applications where situation awareness is critical and, (2) development of the basic technologic capability for transition into training for military applications. For this project, NHRC will develop the understanding of military applications and lead the technology transition from basic science to applications. For the transition work, NHRC requires unique services to complete this project which include core research compatible with NHRCs technologic capabilities and analytic services that will facilitate the technology transition. <BR>The basic technologic capability for this project is the use of recording of electrical activity of the brain and advanced analytic techniques to examine these recordings. There are two critical technologies for this project: (1) high density electro-encephalography (EEG) hardware and, (2) advanced signal analysis computer algorithms in computer software. NHRC has research grade EEG hardware that is robustly linked to computer systems that monitor motion activities. NHRC also uses EEGLab, advanced EEG analysis software, with software modules specifically designed for the research EEG system that is used in our experiments.<BR>NHRC is carrying out the applied research on military personnel. Basic research is being carried out using the same recording equipment and the same analytic systems as NHRC uses by the Swartz  Center for Computational Neurology (SCCN) laboratory. It is critical that the same platforms be used for the core experiments as the ultimate transition program. Smooth translation of the core research to the applications will only occur with an integrated program. Further, it is mandatory that the data acquisition system be designed and configured correctly to enable the subsequent data analysis to discover the signatures of brain activity. Finally, once the experiments have been carried out, sophisticated algorithms must be used and reviewed for accuracy. Expert experiment design, data analysis oversight and data interpretation services are needed for this experiments completion. This requirement must be filled by EEG science and engineering experts.  Expert consultation for analysis and interpretation of research data generated by EEGLab is critical for arriving at correct interpretation of the data from experiments.<BR>The Swartz Center for Computational Neurobiology (SCCN) at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) is NHRCs prime contractor for expert execution and supervision of EEG experiment design, data analysis and data reporting using EEGLab. For continuity of research expertise with NHRC staff abilities and reliable experiment completion, SCCN is essential to this project. <BR>Core experiments and transition for the accurate use of EEGLab with research grade EEG systems for data acquisition is only provided by SCCN. SCCN is the developer and maintainer of EEGLab software. Dr. Tzyy-Ping Jung and Dr. Klaus Gramman are the providers of the experiment design, execution and data analysis and reporting for NHRC through SCCN. Dr. Jung is the lead engineer for EEGLab and is the only engineer that can provide advice on accurate algorithmic modification for data from NHRCs high density EEG system. Dr. Gramman is the SCCN expert on data acquisition, analysis and interpretation for activities in the brain related to motion. These SCCN engineers were critical consultants for the acquisition of NHRCs EEG research capability and have been essential to the Phase 1 and Phase 2 components of this project. They are familiar with the NHRC experiment facilities and collaborate with existing personnel. <BR><BR>3. A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted:<BR><BR>The following market research was conducted in accordance with FAR part 10, Market Research. The most suitable approach to acquiring the acquisition needs for support with the Neural Markers of Loss of Situation Awareness phase 3 project collaboration with NHRC is to sole source to the Swartz Center for Computational Neuroscience  at UCSD.  Therefore, it has also been ascertained (and the data provided below supports) that there is a reasonable expectation of obtaining from the UCSD Swartz Center, the best scientific and technological sources consistent with the demands of the proposed acquisition for the best mix of cost, performances, and schedules. <BR><BR>Description of Government Needs: NHRC, specifically the project for Neural Markers of Loss of Situation Awareness, has the requirement to research the development of technology for training personnel to navigate through complex systems. In order to provide ample research, NHRC requires access to instruments and technology that measure the brain to determine when operators lose situation awareness in order to improve future performances. Such measurement requires the use of software and equipment tools as well as experts in the field to assist in utilizing these tools that are not available at NHRC. An expert in the field who is also the Principal Investigator for this effort has identified the following tools to accomplish such:<BR><BR>	- High density electro-encephalography (EEG) hardware<BR>	- Advanced signal analysis computer algorithms in computer software<BR><BR>A Google and CCR search was conducted in March 2010 in order to determine additional types of organizations normally and commercially available having the above resources in the San Diego area.  The other leading research medical institution in the area that may have the ability to meet the requirements of this effort was identified as the Scripps Research Institute (SRI). SRI (Cage Code 5VRT8) is a leading medical institute in the world for many disorders, however, unlike the UCSD Swartz Center, it does not have the unique combination of facilities and skills the project requires. The Swartz Center is the world-leading developer of EEGlab, software for advanced analysis of high-density EEG. Through Dr. Tzyy-Ping Jung, EEGlab can be configured to accept data from the spatial disorientation experiment. Additionally, Dr. Klaus Gramann, a senior scientist at the Swartz Center is the world expert on testing, identification and localization of brain centers related to spatial orientation. His capability is a specialized area, far beyond the normal areas of clinical testing of the brain. No other facility in San Diego, nor indeed in the world has the capability to carry out, analyze and report the studies on the brain required for this spatial disorientation basic research project.<BR><BR>4. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:<BR><BR>The current campaigns of Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) are generating more complex situations where awareness as a critical brain function is tested throughout various environments of land, sea and air. Poor training and severe and fatal accidents occur throughout DoD and USN operations each year because of loss of situation awareness. The use of UCSD  Swartz Center EEG hardware and the subject matter expertise available could possibly determine when operators lose situation awareness thus allowing for future training behavior modifications to improve performance and save lives. <BR><BR>5. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required: <BR><BR>None<BR><BR>6. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement to the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division via e-mail to: steve.streeter@us.army.mil no later than noon on May 2, 2010.<BR><BR><BR>Contracting Office Address: <BR>RDECOM Contracting Center -  Natick<BR>CCRD-NA-SU, Natick Contracting Division<BR>Kansas Street, Building 1<BR>Natick, MA 01760-5011<BR><BR>Point of Contact:<BR>Steven Streeter, Contract Specialist (508) 233-5704<BR>steve.streeter@us.army.mil<BR><BR>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Statement of Work</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The ORA pesticide laboratories are undergoing a paradigm shift. They are in the process of significantly increasing their sample analysis output and becoming high throughput laboratories. Due to the increased demand for high through put samples analyses on these laboratories, this benchtop centrifuge equipment is essential to helping them meet these processing needs. Pesticide residue analysis in food commodities proceeds in two separate phases: (1) extraction via wet chemical methods, and (2) analysis of the extract by instrumental methods (either gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) or liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS). These centrifuges will be utilized in the extraction phase of the process. In the extraction phase the sample is first composited and then the pesticide residues are extracted into an organic solvent through two series of wet chemical techniques that are separated by an intermediate centrifugation step. Thus, the centrifugation step is a rate limiting step for the extraction process. The faster this step is completed in the extraction process the faster the entire process proceeds and thus the faster the sample extracts are placed onto the instruments for analysis. The MON seeks to provide two versatile, dedicated, bench top centrifuges to each of the laboratories responsible for pesticide residue analysis to support the significant increase in work requirements that they have been charged with.</p>
<p>Scope</p>
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ORA field laboratories identified in #3 below, screen hundreds of food commodity samples for pesticide residues on a daily basis. Pesticide residues have been shown to be unsafe and can pose serious health risks to humans when consumed. The ORA field pesticide laboratories have been notified that they will be expected to significantly increase their sample residue screening output in the near future. Thus, efficiency is vital to this process; these centrifuges will significantly contribute to increased efficiency in the extraction process prior to the analysis by GC/MS and/or LC/MS. The ORA field pesticide laboratories are seeking to procure centrifuges that are rugged, easy and fast to use, do not require a large amount of space, and can process a large number of samples in a short period of time. To meet these requirements the centrifuge must possess or be capable of the following abilities:</p>
<p><br />a. Must be a 120 V, 60 Hz bench top centrifuge with approximate dimensions (LxWxH) of 24 inches x 20 inches x 10 inches.<br />b. Must be able to process tubes in both a fixed angle rotor configuration and swinging bucket rotor configuration.<br />c. The benchtop centrifuge should have a broad range of rotor configurations (must include at least fixed angle and swinging bucket) with adaptors to support a variety of tube sizes to include 15 ml, 50 ml and 175 ml tubes. <br />d. Must have a quick rotor exchange system to allow for faster installation and exchange with just the push of a button. Also, easy chamber access for cleaning convenience to reduced contamination risk.<br />e. Must have a rotor imbalance detection system<br />f. Must have locking rotors<br />g. The fixed angle rotors should have an rpm range of at least 500 rpm to 12,000 rpm; the swinging bucket configuration should have a maximum rpm of at least 6,000 rpm.</p>
<p>In addition to the above listed requirements the vendor should deliver the centrifuges and accessories to the laboratories identified #3b below and include set up, IQ/OQ/PQ and training as part of the delivery.</p>
<p>Delivery or Performance-Period Requirements. <br /><br />The vendor will deliver and set up 2 centrifuges that meet the specifications in the Statement of Work to each of the laboratories listed below. Set up will include IQ/OQ/PQ and in house training on the use of this equipment.</p>
<p>Period of Performance</p>
<p>Delivery of the Centrifuge between (approximately July 1, 2010 and Sept 30, 2010), with at one year initial warranty service after shipment for equipment and ninety days for all other products.</p>
<p>Each centrifuge package should include:</p>

<p><br />52.243-1 Changes--Fixed Price AUG 1987</p>
<p><br />NAFI GENERAL PROVISIONS<br />NONAPPROPRIATED FUND INSTRUMENTALITY GENERAL PROVISIONS</p>
<p>l. DEFINITIONS (JAN 2005) - As used throughout this contract, the following terms and abbreviations have the meanings set forth below:</p>
<p>a. The term "contract" means this agreement or order and any modifications hereto.</p>
<p>b. The abbreviation "NAFI" means Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentality of the United States Government.</p>
<p>c. The term "Contracting Officer" means the person executing or responsible for administering this contract on behalf of the NAFI, which is a party hereto, or their successor or successors.</p>
<p>d. The term "Contractor" means the party responsible for providing supplies and/or services at a certain price or rate to the NAFI under this contract.</p>
<p>e. The abbreviation "FAR" means Federal Acquisition Regulation. <br />2. DISPUTES (NOV 2005) <br />a. Except as otherwise provided in this contract, any dispute or claim concerning this contract which is not disposed of by agreement shall be decided by the Contracting Officer, who shall state his decision in writing and mail or otherwise furnish a copy of it to the Contractor. Within 30 days from the date of receipt of such copy, the Contractor may appeal by mailing or otherwise furnishing to the Contracting Officer a written appeal addressed to the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals, and the decision of the Board shall be final and conclusive; provided that if no such appeal is filed, the decision of the Contracting Officer shall be final and conclusive. The Contractor shall be afforded an opportunity to be heard and to offer evidence in support of any appeal under this clause. Pending final decision on such a dispute, however, the Contractor shall proceed diligently with the performance of the contract and in accordance with the decision of the Contracting Officer unless directed to do otherwise by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>b. A claim by the Contractor shall be made in writing and submitted to the Contracting Officer for a written decision. Contractors shall provide the certification specified below when submitting any claim. Any person duly authorized to bind the Contractor with respect to the claim may execute the certification.</p>
<p>"I certify that the claim is made in good faith; that the supporting data is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief; that the amount requested accurately reflects the contract adjustment for which the Contractor believes the Government is liable; and that I am duly authorized to certify on behalf of the Contractor." <br />c. This "Disputes" clause does not preclude consideration of law questions in connection with decisions provided for in paragraph "a" above, provided, that nothing in this contract shall be construed as making final the decision of any administrative official, representative, or board on a question of law. <br />3. LAW GOVERNING CONTRACTS (JAN 2005) - In any dispute arising out of this contract, the decision of which requires consideration of law questions, the rights and obligations of the parties shall be interpreted and determined in accordance with the substantive laws of the United States of America.</p>
<p>4. LEGAL STATUS (JAN 2005) - The NAFI is an integral part of the Department of Defense and is an instrumentality of the United States Government. Therefore, NAFI contracts are United States Government contracts; however, they do not obligate appropriated funds of the United States.</p>
<p>5. EXAMINATION OF RECORDS (JAN 2005) - This clause is applicable under contracts that are entered into by means of negotiation and where price and costing data are required to support a determination of price reasonableness. This clause does not apply to commercial items or when the Contracting Officer determines that prices agreed upon are based on adequate price competition. The Contractor agrees that the Contracting Officer or his duly authorized representative shall have the right to examine and audit the books and records of the Contractor directly pertaining to the contract during the period of the contract and until the expiration of three years after the final payment.</p>
<p>6. ASSIGNMENT (JAN 2005) - The Contractor or its assignee's rights to be paid amounts due as a result of performance of this contract, may be assigned. No assignment by the Contractor, assigning its rights or delegating its obligations under this contract will be effective and binding on the NAFI until the written terms of the assignment have been approved in writing by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>7. GRATUITIES (JAN 2005)</p>
<p>a. The NAFI may, by written notice to the Contractor, terminate the right of the Contractor to proceed under this contract if it is found, after notice and hearing, by the Secretary of the Air Force or their duly authorized representative, that gratuities (in the form of entertainment, gifts, or otherwise) were offered or given by the Contractor, or any agent, or representative of the Contractor, to any officer or employees of the Government or the NAFI with a view toward securing favorable treatment with respect to the awarding or amending, or the making of any determinations with respect to the performing of such contract.</p>
<p>b. In the event this contract is terminated as provided in paragraph "a" hereof, the NAFI shall be entitled (i) to pursue the same remedies against the Contractor as it could pursue in the event of a breach of contract by the Contractor, and (ii) as a penalty in addition to any other damages to which it may be entitled by law, to exemplary damages in an amount (as determined by the Secretary of the Air Force or their duly authorized representative) which shall be not less than three nor more than ten times the cost incurred by the Contractor in providing any such gratuities to any such officer or employee.</p>
<p>c. The rights and remedies of the NAFI provided in this clause shall not be exclusive and are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or under this contract.</p>
<p>8. TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE (JAN 2005) - The Contracting Officer, by written notice, may terminate this contract, in whole or in part, when it is in the best interest of the NAFI. If this contract is for supplies and is so terminated, the Contractor shall be compensated in accordance with FAR, Sub Parts 49.1 and 49.2 in effect on this contract's date. To the extent that this contract is for services and is so terminated, the NAFI shall be liable only for payment in accordance with the payment provisions of this contract for services rendered prior to the effective date of termination, providing there are no Contractor claims covering nonrecurring costs for capital investment. If there are any such Contractor claims, they shall be settled in accordance with FAR, Sub Parts 49.1 and 49.2.</p>
<p>9. CANCELLATION BY MUTUAL AGREEMENT (JAN 2005) - Should the situation warrant, the parties upon mutual agreement and no costs, may cancel this contract.</p>
<p>10. TERMINATION FOR CAUSE (JAN 2005)</p>
<p>a. The NAFI may, subject to paragraphs (c) and (d) below, by written notice of cause to the Contractor, terminate this contract in whole or in part if the Contractor fails to- <br />(i) Deliver the supplies or perform the service within the time specified within this contract or any Extension;</p>
<p>(ii) Make progress, so as to endanger performance of this contract (but see subparagraph (a)(2) below);or</p>
<p>(iii) Perform any of the other provisions of this contract (but see subparagraph (a)(2) below).</p>
<p>b. The NAFI's right to terminate this contract under subdivisions (1)(ii) and (1)(iii) above, may be exercised if the Contractor does not cure such failure within 10 days (or more if authorized in writing by the Contracting Officer) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying the failure.</p>
<p>c. If the NAFI terminates this contract in whole or in part, it may acquire, under the terms and in the manner the Contracting Officer considers appropriate, supplies or services similar to those terminated, and the Contractor will remain liable to the NAFI for any excess costs for those supplies or services. However the Contractor must continue the work not terminated.</p>
<p>d. The Contractor shall not be liable for any excess costs if the failure to perform the contract arises from causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor. Examples of such causes include (1) acts of God or of the public enemy, (2) act of the NAFI in either its sovereign or contractual capacity, (3) fires, (4) floods, (5) epidemics, (6) quarantine restrictions, (7) strikes, (8) freight embargoes, and; (9) unusually severe weather. Defaults by subcontractors at any tier for any reason do not constitute causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor.</p>
<p>e. If this contract is terminated for cause, the NAFI may require the Contractor to transfer title and deliver to the NAFI as directed by the Contracting Officer, any (1) completed supplies, and (2) partially completed supplies and materials, parts, tool dies, jigs, fixtures, plans, drawings, information, and contract rights (collectively referred to as manufacturing materials in the clause) that the Contractor has specifically produced or acquired for the terminated portion of this contract. Upon direction of the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall also protect and preserve property in its possession in which the NAFI has an interest.</p>
<p>f. The NAFI shall pay the contract price for completed supplies delivered and accepted. The Contractor and Contracting Officer shall agree on the amount of payment for manufacturing materials delivered and accepted and for the protection and preservation of the property. Failure to agree will be a dispute under the Disputes Clause. The NAFI may withhold from these amounts any sum the Contracting Officer determines to be necessary to protect the NAFI against loss because of outstanding liens or claims of former lien holders.</p>
<p>g. If, after termination, it is determined that the cause by the Contractor was excusable, the rights and obligations of the parties shall be the same as if the termination had been issued for convenience of the NAFI.</p>
<p>h. The rights and remedies of the NAFI in this clause are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or under this contract.</p>
<p>11. INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE (JAN 2005) - Inspection and acceptance will be at destination, unless otherwise provided in this contract. Not withstanding the requirements for any NAFI inspection and test contained in specifications applicable to this contract, except where specialized inspections or tests are specified for performance solely by the NAFI, the Contractor, shall perform or have performed the inspections and tests required to substantiate that the supplies provided under the contract conform to the drawings, specifications, and contract requirements listed herein, including if applicable the technical requirements for the manufacturers' part numbers specified herein. The Contractor shall only tender for acceptance those items that conform to the requirements of this contract. The Government reserves the right to inspect or test any supplies or services that have been tendered for acceptance. The Government may require repair or replacement of nonconforming supplies or reperformance of nonconforming services at no increase in contract price. Acceptance of the supplies or services or a written notice of rejections must be accomplished on or before the fifth working day following delivery of the supplies or services, unless otherwise specified in this contract.</p>
<p>12. VARIATION IN QUANTITY (JAN 2005) - No variation in quantity of any item called for by this contract will be accepted unless authorized by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>13. PARTIAL DELIVERIES (JAN 2005) - Partial deliveries are not permitted unless authorized by the terms of the contract or approved by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>14. PAYMENTS (JAN 2005) - Partial payments will be made when deliveries are authorized or as approved by the Contracting Officer. Payments and penalties for late payments are subject to the requirements established by the Prompt Payment Act, as amended, and as implemented for NAFI's. If the NAFI makes payment but such payment fails to include a prompt payment penalty due to the Contractor within 10 days from when the contract payment is made, penalty amounts will not be paid unless the Contractor makes a written request within forty days after the date of payment.</p>
<p>15. HOLD AND SAVE HARMLESS (JAN 2005) - The Contractor shall indemnify, hold and save harmless, and defend the NAFI, its outlets and customers from any liability, claimed or established for violation or infringement of any patent, copyright, or trademark right asserted by any third party with respect to goods hereby ordered or any part thereof. Contractor further agrees to hold the NAFI harmless from all claims or judgments for damages resulting from the use of products or services listed in this contract, except for such claims or damages caused by, or resulting from negligence of NAFI customers, employees, agents, or representatives. Also, Contractor shall at all times hold and save harmless the NAFI, its agents, representatives, and employees from any and all suits, claims, charges, and expenses which arise out of acts or omissions of Contractor, its agents, representatives, or employees.</p>
<p>16. MODIFICATIONS (JAN 2005) - No agreement or understanding to modify this contract will be binding upon the NAFI unless made in writing and signed by a Contracting Officer from the office that issued the contract or its successor.</p>
<p>17. TAXES (JAN 2005)</p>
<p>a. Except as may be otherwise provided in this contract, the contract price includes all taxes, duties or other public charges in effect and applicable to this contract on the contract date, except any tax, duty, or other public charge, which by law, regulation or governmental agreement, is not applicable to expenditures made by the NAFI or on its behalf; or any tax, duty, or other public charge from which the Contractor, or any subcontractor hereunder, is exempt by law, regulation or otherwise. If any such tax, duty, or other public charge has been included in the contract price, through error or otherwise, the contract price shall be correspondingly reduced.</p>
<p>b. If for any reason, after the contract date of execution, the Contractor or subcontractor is relieved in whole or in part from the payment or the burden of any tax, duty, or other public charge included in the contract price, the contract price shall be correspondingly reduced; or if the Contractor or subcontractor is required to pay in whole or in part any tax, duty, of other public charge which was not applicable at the contract date of execution the contract price shall be correspondingly increased.</p>
<p>18. PROOF OF SHIPMENT (JAN 2005) - (Applicable to shipments outside the United States through the Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC) and Parcel Post shipments to overseas destinations.) <br />a. Notwithstanding any clause of this contract to the contrary, payment will be made for items not yet received, upon receipt of an invoice accompanied by an appropriate proof of shipment. If shipment is made by insured parcel post, the contractor must furnish a copy of the Insured Mail Receipt issued by the US Postal Service. Otherwise, a stamped copy of a Certificate of Mailing issued by the US Postal Service must be furnished. If shipment is made by a common carrier (rail, air or motor freight), the Contractor must furnish a signed copy of the shipping document on which items are receipted for by the common carrier. A signed receipt by a NAFI representative at the delivery point (CCP or POE) is also acceptable evidence of proof of shipment.</p>
<p>b. Forwarding a proof of shipment and an invoice for payment by the Contractor shall be construed as a certification by the contractor that the items shipped conform to the specifications.</p>
<p>c. Notwithstanding any provisions of this clause or any payment made pursuant to the terms of this clause prior to receipt of the items contracted for, the NAFI retains the right to inspect upon receipt and the right to reject nonconforming items. The liability of the Contractor with respect to items for which payments have been made will, after inspection by the NAFI or after the expiration of a reasonable time following delivery to the NAFI within which inspection may be made, whichever occurs first, be limited to (i) exceptions taken at the time of inspection, and (ii) latent defects, fraud, or such gross mistakes as amount to fraud.</p>
<p>19. COMMERCIAL WARRANTY (JAN 2005) - The Contractor agrees that the supplies or services furnished under this contract shall be covered by the most favorable commercial warranties the Contractor gives to any customer for such supplies or services and that the rights and remedies provided herein are in addition to and do not limit any rights afforded to the NAFI by any other clause of this contract. The printed terms and conditions of such warranty will be provided to the NAFI with the delivery of any supplies covered.</p>
<p>20. ADVERTISEMENTS (JAN 2005) - Contractor agrees that none of its nor its agent's advertisements, to include publications, merchandise, promotions, coupons, sweepstakes, contest, sales brochures, etc, shall state, infer or imply that the Contractor's products or services are approved, promoted, or endorsed by the NAFI. Any advertisement, including cents-off coupons, which refers to a NAFI will contain a statement that the advertisement is neither paid for, nor sponsored in whole or in part by, the particular activity.</p>
<p>21. DISCOUNTS FOR PROMPT PAYMENT (JAN 2005)</p>
<p>a. Discounts for prompt payment will not be considered in the evaluation of offers. However, any offered discount will form a part of the award, and will be taken if payment is made within the discount period indicated in the offer by the offeror. As an alternative to offering a prompt payment discount in conjunction with the offer, offerors awarded contracts may include prompt payment discounts on individual invoices.</p>
<p>b. In connection with any discount offered for prompt payment, time shall be computed from the date of the invoice. If the Contractor has not placed a date on the invoice, the due date shall be calculated from the date the designated billing office receives a proper invoice, provided the agency annotates such invoice with the date of receipt at the time of receipt. For the purpose of computing the discount earned, payment shall be considered to have been made on the date that appears on the payment check or, for an electronic funds transfer, the specified payment date. When the discount date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday when Federal Government offices are closed and Government business is not expected to be conducted, payment may be made on the following business day.</p>
<p>22. INVOICES (JAN 2005): <br />a. An invoice is a written request for payment under the contract for supplies delivered or for services rendered. In order to be proper, an invoice should include (and in order to support the payment of interest penalties, must include) the following: <br />(i) Invoice date;</p>
<p>(ii) Name of Contractor;</p>
<p>(iii) Contract number (including order number, if any), contract line item number, contract description of supplies or services, quantity, contract unit of measure and unit price, and extended total;</p>
<p>(iv) Shipment number and date of shipment (Bill of Lading number and weight of shipment will be shown for shipments on Government Bills of Lading);</p>
<p>(v) Name and address to which payment is to be sent (which must be the same as that in the contract or on a proper notice of assignment);</p>
<p>(vi) Name (where practicable), title, phone number and mailing address of person to be notified in event of a defective invoice; and</p>
<p>(vii) Any other information or documentation required by other provisions of the contract (such as evidence of shipment). Invoices shall be prepared and submitted in duplicate (one copy shall be marked "Original") unless otherwise specified.</p>
<p>b. For purposes of determining if interest begins to accrue under the PROMPT PAYMENT ACT (PUBLIC LAW 97-177):</p>
<p>(i) A proper invoice will be deemed to have been received when it is received by the office designated in the contract for receipt of invoices and acceptance of the supplies delivered or services rendered has occurred.</p>
<p>(ii) Payment shall be considered made on the date on which a check for such payment is dated.</p>
<p>(iii) Payment terms (e.g., "Net 20") offered by the contractor will not be deemed Required payment dates.</p>
<p>(iv) The following periods of time will not be included:</p>
<p>(A) After receipt of improper invoice and prior to notice of any defect or impropriety, but not to exceed three days for meat and meat food products, five days for perishable agricultural commodities, and 15 days in all other cases, and</p>
<p>(B) Between the date of a notice of any defect or impropriety and the date a proper invoice is received. When the notice is in writing, it shall be considered made on the date shown on the notice.</p>
<p>23. NOTIFICATION OF DEBARMENT/SUSPENSION STATUS (JAN 2005) - The Contractor shall provide immediate notice to the Contracting Officer in the event of being suspended, debarred or declared ineligible by any other Federal Department or agency, or upon receipt of a notice of proposed debarment from another DOD Agency, during the performance of this contract.</p>
<p>24. NON WAIVER OF DEFAULTS (JAN 2005) - Any failure by the NAFI at any time, or from time to time, to enforce or require strict performance of any terms or conditions of this contract will not constitute waiver thereof and will not affect or impair such terms or conditions in any way or the NAFI's right at any time to avail itself of such remedies as it may have for any breach or breaches of such terms and conditions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />____________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:</p>
<p>HEALTH &amp; WELFARE: $3.35 per hour or $134.00 per week or $580.66 per month</p>
<p>VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or<br />successor; 3 weeks after 8 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years. Length of service<br />includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or<br />successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the<br />performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)</p>
<p>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year: New Year's Day, Martin Luther<br />King Jr.'s Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day,<br />Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A<br />contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in<br />accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4.174)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:</p>
<p>1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does<br />not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,<br />administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because<br />most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate<br />not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per<br />week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.<br />400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations<br />within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not<br />list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey<br />data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds<br />$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For<br />example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties<br />within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer<br />occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,<br />then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the<br />conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage<br />determination.</p>
<p>Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer<br />industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer<br />professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees<br />who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<br />(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including<br />consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional<br />specifications;<br />(2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or<br />modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and<br />related to user or system design specifications;<br />(3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer<br />programs related to machine operating systems; or<br />(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<br />requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).</p>
<p>2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY &amp; SUNDAY PAY: If you<br />work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential<br />and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.<br />If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<br />regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday<br />premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime<br />(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered<br />overtime work).</p>
<p><br />HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees<br />employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or<br />in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This<br />includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive<br />ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder<br />and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.<br />Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations<br />on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations<br />involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.</p>
<p>A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br />represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to<br />ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials<br />which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the<br />employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the<br />like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.<br />All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and<br />incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials<br />are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for<br />ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.</p>
<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<br />local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<br />employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<br />determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<br />following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<br />cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<br />the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<br />this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<br />agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<br />affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<br />and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in<br />those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"<br />materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<br />not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<br />laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<br />of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<br />there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,<br />unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A<br />links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.<br />gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at<br />http://wdol.gov/.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form<br />1444 (SF 1444)}</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<br />not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<br />be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such<br />conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the<br />fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by<br />the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)<br />of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall<br />be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}<br />When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444<br />should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be<br />conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<br />proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<br />proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage<br />rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<br />authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<br />representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the<br />contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<br />performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<br />of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage<br />and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,<br />for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<br />the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.</p>
<p>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<br />that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the<br />wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<br />determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<br />Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<br />classifications listed in the wage determination.</p>

<CONTACT>Mark I. Heiligman, Program Manager, Email dni-iarpa-baa-10-02@ugov.gov
<DESC>The QCS Program's goal is to accurately estimate and significantly reduce the computational resources required to implement quantum algorithms on a realistic quantum computer.
<p>Quantum computing offers the potential of dramatically better performance on certain problems compared to classical computing. As a result, substantial research effort has been invested in discovering high-level algorithms that could operate on a quantum computer, and in developing a wide variety of physical technologies that might make the construction of a quantum computer possible. Considerably less attention has been paid to the computer science aspects of quantum computing.</p>
<p>In order to implement a high-level quantum algorithm in a given physical technology, one must first know the model of quantum computation that the technology supports. For this BAA we are interested in the quantum circuit model, in which computations are expressed as sequences of logical gates acting on two-level quantum systems, or "qubits." Given the model and an algorithm instance, we wish to determine how many quantum resources (e.g., qubits and gate operations) are required. Two problems arise. First, accurate resource estimates are unknown for most algorithms-many are only specified in "big-O" notation that omits reference to a specific computational model. Moreover, although asymptotic estimates of the required (perfect) resources exist for some algorithms, there is currently no standardized full accounting of all resources required to implement quantum algorithms on hardware consisting of non-ideal qubits and non-ideal quantum gates (henceforth referred to as a "realistic" quantum computer). This is especially true for problem sizes where quantum computing is thought to have an advantage over classical computing.</p>
<p>Second, for the few algorithms that have been analyzed in some detail, the number of required quantum resources is intractably large even for modest problem sizes, let alone large problems where quantum computers might have an advantage over existing or near-term classical computers. The quantum error correction and quantum control techniques necessary to perform large quantum computations on realistic quantum hardware appear to incur a very large overhead. While it is certainly true that better qubit and quantum gate technologies will reduce the amount of required overhead, the premise behind the QCS Program is that quantum computer science will also play a significant role in reducing resource requirements. QCS will create an automated process for a full and accurate estimation of required resources for the implementation of quantum algorithms, and it will seek to improve the performance of quantum error-correction and quantum control protocols while reducing their associated overhead costs.</p>
<p>The IARPA QCS Program consists of two phases over a four-year period. Phase 1 will be 12 months, and Phase 2 will be 36 months. Multiple awards are anticipated.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. THE SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF FAR 13.5 TEST PROGRAM FOR CERTAIN COMMERCIAL ITEMS.
<p>This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-40.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. However, this requirement is unrestricted and all interested Contractors may submit a quotation.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The optical parametric oscillator (OPO) is a near-infrared continuous wave (CW) laser system suitable for high-resolution spectroscopy experiments. Necessary attributes of the OPO include its relatively high CW power and its broad spectral coverage. A laser of this type is required for photo acoustic absorption spectroscopy (PAS) experiments of greenhouse gases conducted by NIST's Nanoscale and Optical Metrology Group. Note that pulsed OPO lasers are not acceptable for the proposed experiments. This OPO system will enable best-in-the world PAS measurements of GHG absorption properties. These NIST studies will require a fully configured, turnkey OPO instrument that can be integrated into existing experiments.</p>
<p><br />The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for a Continuous Wave Optical Parametric Oscillator.</p>
<p>All interested Contractor's shall provide a quote for the following line items:</p>

The solicitation number is SAQMMA10Q0134 and is issued as a Request for Quote. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-34. The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334119 with a small business size standard of 1,000.00 employees. This requirement is a full and open competitive requirement. 

The Department of State (DoS) Office of Computer Security (CS) uses numerous tools and products to ensure the security posture of the Departments unclassified OpenNet system. One of the critical capabilities required by the Monitoring and Incident Response Division (MIRD) and the Cyber Threat Analysis Division (CTAD) is the ability to capture and store several weeks of complete network packet traffic. This capability allows the Computer Network Defenders (CND) to replay activity on the network to support investigation and remediation of incidents and threats. 

The Department of State requires a commercial product that can perform the following specifications:

The offered solution must be able to: Facilitate Identification of Malicious Email; Provide Enhanced Analytics; Provide Packet Capture Capability; Provide Alerting Capability; Provide anomaly detection capabilities; Provide Insight into Lateral Activity which is defined as moving from resource to resource while conducting malicious behavior;  The offered solution must  Identify Insecure Protocols and Practices; Must  Provide Warning and Indication Capability; Must  Provide Drill-Down Capability for Ambiguous Data; Must Reduce Time Required for Locating and Reconstructing Sessions; Must Comply with Integration and Operational Support Requirements.

Interface speeds will be gigabit copper and expect an average of fifty percent utilization.  Full packet capture analysis will be performed using this system with a sixty day data retention requirement.  Physical capture methods will be through both span ports and TAPS.  The system will be centrally managed, but analysis will be done through the user interface from multiple locations.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />Hotline telephone number: 202.372.3695<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) <br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />Hotline telephone number: 202.372.3695<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

<DESC><p>The Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention (CDC) has a requirement for a research study to conduct the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) for the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), Division of Vital Statistics (DVS) Reproductive Statistics Branch. This solicitation will result in the award of a single performance based, cost plus fixed fee contract. The period of performance of this contract shall not exceed 120 months, (10 years total). Estimated start date: 1 Sep 2010 Estimated completion date: 30 Jun 2020. Although the government can end the contract after any segment, CDC's intent is to conduct the study, collecting at least 40,000 in-person interviews during 8 years of interviewing. The decision to proceed with each succeeding segment is based on availability of funds and whether the progress made warrants continuation, but the intention of NCHS is to carry out all segments of the contract. All work under this contract shall be performed within the fifty (50) states and the District of Columbia. The Contractor shall furnish the necessary personnel, material, equipment, services and facilities (except as otherwise specified in the Perfornace Work Statement). Full details will be listed in the Request for Proposal (RFP). NCHS has conducted the NSFG periodically since 1973 to provide national data on factors related to birth and pregnancy rates, maternal and child health, reproductive and sexual health, and parenting. After a critical start-up phase that includes design, pretest, and development of technological tools, the program is to be conducted as a continuous national survey producing approximately 5,000 in-person interviews per year with men and women 15-44 years of age for up to 8 years (mid-2011 through mid-2019), a total of about 40,000 interviews, with oversamples of Hispanic men and women, Black men and women, and males and females 15-19 years of age. Using continuous interviewing, cost efficiencies and quality gains can be made by leaving the design in place for about a decade. Further information on the survey is available at http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg.htm.&nbsp; Interviewing to be conducted continuously from approximately June 1, 2011 through May 31, 2019. (Depending on the date of contract award, these dates may be adjusted.) Working closely and collaboratively with the NCHS/NSFG work team to develop materials and specifications, the contractor shall conduct all the necessary activities, including sample design, pretest, CAPI programming, hiring, supervising and training interviewers, data processing, data file preparation, and data file documentation, for a complete national survey. This requirement will be a full and open competition open to all who meet the requirements. Questions from Offerors on this solicitation will be accepted up to 2:00 p.m (Eastern Standard Time) May 5, 2010. Questions must be in writing and sent via email to the attention of the Contract Specialist, Lawrence McCoy, email LMcCoy1@cdc.gov. Responses by Facsimile (Fax) will not be accepted. No telephone calls will be accepted. <strong>A pre-proposal conference on the above referenced solicitation will be held on Thursday, May 13, 2010 at 2:00 p.m. (Eastern Standard Time) at: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), Division of Vital Statistics (DVS), 3311 Toledo Road, Auditorium A, first floor.

<DESC>THIS IS A MODIFICATION TO THE COMBINED ANNOUNCEMENT FOR SOLICITATION NUMBER N8364109999.
THE MANUFACTURER'S SPECIFICATIONS ARE AVAILABE BY EMAIL REQUEST TO BARBARA_ESCHELS@NPS.GOV
FOLLOWING IS THE JUSTIFICATION FOR USE OF A BRAND NAME:
JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITIONOver $100,000 1.	Identification of the Agency and the Contracting Activity:Department of the InteriorNational Park ServiceLake Mead NRABoulder city, NV 89005
2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Approved:This project is in response to a flood event that happened with no notification or warning in the Cottonwood area.  After close analysis of the area there were holes in our current systems coverage of the area. The work being accomplished will add additional coverage to the existing flash flood system at Cottonwood Cove, correct the deficiencies in the current system and upgrade the current system to include a new automated system and additional monitoring sensors integrated with existing sensors that would trigger or activate sirens when more than 1 - 2 sensors are set off.    
3.	A Description of the Supplies or services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs, Including the Estimated Value:A certified HydroLynx installer to provide and install all equipment, software, programming telemetry radios,  integration of the HydroLynx flash flood warning system at Cottonwood Cove and the parks system.  This project will add two channel flow monitors, rain gauge, and central siren system. All completely interfaced/integrated wirelessly with each other, the existing system, and the dispatch center as to trigger a flash flood event prevent false alarms and provide immediate automated response. The Scope of Work includes an estimate of $149,000, providing concrete support walls are needed for the monitoring stations.
4.	An Identification of the Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition: FAR 6.302-1(c) Application for Brand Name Descriptions 
5.	A Demonstration That the Proposed Contractor's Unique Qualifications or the Nature of the Acquisition Requires Use of the Authority Cited:
 Hydrolynx as with all Flash Flood Systems is proprietary.  Therefore, other companies equipment may not be compatible with the current system.  This project is to integrate additional monitors and sirens into the existing system.  Selecting a different system or manufacturer would require replacement of the whole system at Cottonwood Cove which would escalate the project to an estimated three times the cost of this current project.  Another manufacturer would have to include adding special telemetry radio repeaters, new licensing for the frequencies through NTIA, increase solar power & batteries on mountain top radio sites, basically duplicating part of the existing backhaul radio system.  The existing system is monitored by more than one mountain top site for redundancy, so new equipment would be needed to support the additional system.  In addition, a new software package would be needed in the dispatch center to monitor the new system which could cause issues with two flash flood software programs running at the same time along with a myriad of other programs being run on the dispatch centers computers at the same time.   Furthermore, additional testing equipment, factory training for service technicians and additional spare parts will be needed, creating an unnecessary expense for the Government.  Finally, the dispatch center staff would need to be trained on the additional system, again an unnecessary expense.  
6.	A Description of Efforts Made to Ensure that Offers Are Solicited From as Many Potential Sources as is Practicable, Including Whether a Notice Was or Will Be Publicized as Required by FAR Subpart 5.2 and, If Not, Which Exception Under FAR 5.202 Applies:
The existing system was procured using full and open competition in 2005.  The current procurement to upgrade the software and add new equipment will be synopsized in accordance with FAR 5.102(a)(6), which states that the justification shall be uploaded for electronic review with the solicitation package.  
7.	A Determination by the Contracting Officer That the Anticipated Cost to the Government Will Be Fair and Reasonable:
A review of catalog or internet pricing of the competition would provide back-up documentation that the pricing received from HydroLynx is fair and reasonable.  Furthermore, HydroLynx is the system manufacturer, thus saving money when working with a third party. 
8.	A Description of the Market Research Conducted (see FAR Part 10) and the Results or a Statement of the Reason Market Research Was Not Conducted: Market research was not conducted.  The current warning system was manufactured and installed   by HydroLynx.  The HydroLynx system uses proprietary software to operate.  
9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition (see FAR 6.302-2 (9) (i) - (iii) for some examples):
In accordance with FAR 6.302-1(c), An acquisition that uses a brand name description or other purchase description to specify a particular brand name, product, or feature of a product, peculiar to one manufacturer does not provide for full & open competition regardless of the number of sources solicited.   The above description is essential to the Government's requirements, thereby precluding consideration of a product manufactured by another company.  
10.	 A Listing of the Sources, If Any, That Expressed in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition: NONE
11.	 A Statement of the Actions, If Any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome Any Barriers to Competition Before Any Subsequent Acquisition for the Supplies or Services Required:
A New System is not cost effective or feasible at this time.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITIONNational Park Service, National Mall and Memorial Parks

PART 1 - BACKGROUND
1. Date:  4/26/2010
2. Description of Service/Supplies Required:  Victor Stanley Ironsites Series S-35 receptacles and components.

4. Proposed Contractor:  Victor Stanley, Inc.
PART II - JUSTIFICATION
1. Authority Cited:
The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1) in accordance with;  [X] FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies and services will satisfy Agency Requirements, [  ] FAR 6.302-2, Unusual and compelling urgency.
 2. Nature and/or Description of the action being approved:
To purchase 110 of each item listed below:"	Victor Stanley Ironsites Series S-35 (24-gallon capacity) Receptacles; "	Ironsites Series S-35 Recycle Lid Decals;"	1/8" ABS Plastic Bottom Plate Covers"	24-Gallon High Capacity, High Density Black Plastic Liners 
3.  State why the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or nature of the acquisition requires use of the      authority cited:		The use of Victor Stanley product descriptions is essential to the Government's requirements. The National Mall and Memorial Parks currently has Victor Stanley Ironsites Series S-35 receptacles located throughout the National Mall for waste collection. There will be additional receptacles strategically installed, next to each Victor Stanley S-35 waste receptacle on the Mall, to collect recyclables. By using the same model Victor Stanley receptacle for this purpose, we will not be introducing a non-historic element into the historic cultural landscape, thus avoiding the possibility of creating an adverse effect on the National Mall as defined by Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966. These additional receptacles to be purchased must be an exact physical match to those currently in place.
4. Price Reasonableness:
The Government anticipates that the proposed cost will be fair and reasonable.
5. Is this requirement a continuation of previous effort?
No
6. Market Survey/Effort to Obtain Competition:

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

<DESC>****Modification 1 to Presolicitation Notice ARRA-OS-PACES_Presolicitation****<br /><br />The purpose of this modification is to answer questions received in response to the presolicitation and update the solicitation release date:<br /><br />I. Questions and Answers:<br /><br />Question 1: Is this a small business set -aside?<br /><br />Answer 1: The presolicitation clearly states "FDA intends to solicit this requirement as&nbsp;&nbsp; "Full and Open Competition."<br /><br />Question 2: Please clarify, the Presolicitation states "The NAICS Code is 541712 with a small business size standard of 500 employees" and also states "FDA intends to solicit this requirement as a Full and Open competitive requirement."
<p>Answer 2: As stated in Part D this is a Full and Open Competitive Requirement: SBA has established numerical definitions, or "size standards," for all for-profit industries. Size standards represent the largest size that a business (including its subsidiaries and affiliates) may be to remain classified as a small business concern. Additional information on size standards can be found at http://www.sba.gov/contractingopportunities/officials/size/index.html.<br /><br />II. Updates<br /><br />The anticipated release date of the solicitation has been updated to read&nbsp;on or around May 10, 2010.<br /><br /><br /><br />All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.<br />_________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to solicit proposals under solicitation number 10-223-SOL-00065 (subject to change) for an initiative called "Partnership in Applied Comparative Effectiveness Science" (PACES). PACES is an initiative that seeks to advance the science for such CER studies through leveraging available data, in particular the joint ARRA FDA-CER efforts, to form an enhanced standardized database, Janus. The NAICS Code is 541712 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. This requirement will be funded by the Recovery Act.</p>
<p>A. Project Background</p>
<p>Initiatives to compare the effectiveness of different medical interventions and approaches to their delivery have attracted tremendous interest. While comparative effectiveness research (CER) has typically been associated with enhancing the efficiency in the use of health care resources, there is a broader vision of the potential goals and benefits of such research. CER could extend beyond the application of specific intervention methods to controlled clinical trials or within specific health care settings. For example CER could be used to better understand what interventions work best for individuals and subgroups within populations.</p>
<p>As such, CER can be instrumental in supporting and driving the development of personalized medicine, and improving not only the efficiency of care, but also outcomes for all individuals. The science can be used to increase patient benefit, by identifying individuals who are most likely to benefit from an intervention, and to reduce risks, by identifying and protecting individuals who may be harmed. The hope of personalized medicine is that new and existing therapies and devices will be used in combination with improved diagnostic assessments to develop a tailored strategy for treating each patient. <br />A significant step in achieving this goal is to define subtypes or subpopulations of patients with disease, such that different therapies, often with different targets and mechanisms of action, can be compared with respect to how they perform in each of these subtypes. Within the FDA, the intent is to help provide a scientific framework that can capitalize on increased CER efforts to better realize these goals of personalized medicine.</p>
<p>The FDA houses the largest known repository of clinical study data--including data on drug biologics and devices safety, effectiveness and performance. These data are an invaluable resource for CER. Both pre- and post-approval data collected and housed at the FDA can be combined with other datasets on long term health outcomes that reside in other agencies or the private sector. As personalized medicine develops, FDA expects an increase in the need for comparisons across products (and associated delivery mechanisms) to define how these products should be used in combination for individualized health care before and after FDA approval. Development and use of sound, consistent science-based approaches to the design, conduct and analysis of such data and the assessment for labeling and regulatory purposes, will be critical.</p>
<p><br />B. Objective</p>
<p>The Partnership in Applied Comparative Effectiveness Science (PACES) is an initiative that seeks to advance the science for such CER studies through leveraging available data, in particular the joint ARRA FDA-CER efforts, to form an enhanced standardized database, Janus. The PACES initiative will be conducted with a contractor who has biological, and clinically relevant computational expertise. The contractor will work with FDA Center scientific and statistical experts to define questions, datasets and approaches for performing complex analyses for comparative and multi-study analyses on FDA and other large clinical datasets.

<DESC>The US Forest Service EROC Northwest is seeking a qualified firm to provide professional Architect and Engineer services for detailed safety/code inspections, structural analysis, cost estimate development, design drawings development, and specification development for several, remote fire lookout towers on the Malheur National forest.

Buildings:
1.  Most of the lookout towers were built from 1920 to 2002. 
2.  Sites have no commercial power.  Some sites have solar panels, propane heating, lighting, cooking systems.

This project shall be completed in two phases:
1.  Phase I:  Field Investigation, site visit and measurements 
2.  Phase II: Deliverables as Required by this Contract.

The work will consist of but not be limited to the following:
 Each tower shall receive a thorough field inspection to determine its general condition.  Inspection methods such as coring of concrete, magnetic particle, dye penetrant, ultrasonic inspection, stress wave velocity, wood member coring, hammer soundings, moisture content etc., shall be done as necessary.  The inspection shall check the overall condition of the tower for items in need of repair or maintenance to determine the safe occupancy of employees.  All deficiencies are to be recorded and reported.
 Towers which are obviously in such deteriorated condition that safe lookout personal use is not practical shall be reported to the CO, COR, or a responsible Forest Officer, immediately.
 All towers shall be inspected and a structural analysis conducted to determine the safety and adequacy of each tower in their current condition.  The analysis shall be made according to applicable sections of the latest editions of the International Building Code as amended by the State of Oregon, industry standard guidelines, and ASCE recommendations.
 A report narrating the field investigation findings, recommendations, results of the structural analysis, and cost estimates shall be developed.  Design drawings and specifications shall be developed in conjunction with the report.  The drawings and specifications shall be sufficient in detail to be used for contract documents correcting the towers deficiencies.

There is no solicitation package to download.  All information needed is to submit responses on Standard Form (SF) SF-330 (Part 1 and 2).  Selection will be in accordance with the Brooks Act and FAR Part 36 to determine the most highly qualified firm. Contractors should ensure the following information is included in your response.

<DESC>RECOVERY ACTION.  For informational purposes only.  This is a within scope modification to a competitively awarded IDIQ contract- New Year Tech, HHSN263200800005I, task order LARC-2008-OLAW-0019, line item #2.   This modification provides ARRA funding in the amount of $10,481.40 to support the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare for Base Year.  The DUNS number for New Year Tech, Inc. is 17-994-4574.    The work scope being accomplished under the task order modification as a result of the receipt of the ARRA funds is within the scope of the contract. The prospects for performing the ARRA scope of work under a firm fixed-price (FFP) contract were evaluated prior issuance of the modification.   The work contemplated varies depending on the influx of ARRA funded grants, making it difficult to accurately estimate the extent or duration of work or to anticipate costs with any reasonable degree of confidence.  (FAR 16.601(c))

<DESC>Exterior and Interior Painting Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC), Various Locations, State of Hawaii.  The work includes, but is not limited to preparing surfaces, priming, providing exterior and interior coatings to buildings and other structures.  It also includes providing fluid applied resilient (resinous) flooring for various interior and exterior surfaces.  The work will be for the Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force and various Federal Agencies located in the State of Hawaii.  The contracting Officer will specify the exact locations on each task order.
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 238320 and the annual size standard is $14 million.  
The proposed contract is limited to qualifying 8(a) firms in the Hawaii District Office (HDO) of the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA).  The Government will not consider offers from other 8(a) firms or from 8(a) firms outside of the HDO.  It has been determined that competition will be limited to 8(a) firms located within the geographical area serviced by the SBA Hawaii District Office (HDO) and other 8(a) firms with a bona fide place of business within the geographical/competitive area and with the assigned NAICS code.  All other 8(a) BD participants are deemed ineligible to submit offers.
This procurement consists of one solicitation with the intent of awarding a minimum of two (2) Firm Fixed-Price Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contracts.  The Government reserves the right to cancel the procurement if only one proposal is received that offers the best value to the Government.
The solicitation utilizes source selection procedures, which require Offerors to submit a technical and price proposal for evaluation by the Government.  Offerors shall provide coefficients to adjust unit prices established by the Government, which will be specified in the contract.  The Government's unit prices are in place costs, which shall include, but not limited to, all direct and indirect costs for labor, equipment, tools, transportation (i.e., travel time to and from the site of work and other transportation costs such as pick-up trucks, etc.), records, reports, overhead, profit, taxes, insurance and cost estimates.  There will be no adjustments made to the listed unit prices after contract award.  The Contractor's coefficient will be multiplied by the unit price from the Unit Price List for the line item ordered.  This amount will be multiplied by the quantity to obtain the line item amount.  The technical factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than price.  The anticipated technical factors are:  FACTOR 1: Past Performance of the Construction Contractor; FACTOR 2: Experience and Qualifications of the Construction Contractor's Key Personnel; FACTOR 3: Management Plan for the Contract.
The minimum guarantee for the base period only will be $5,000.  The minimum guarantee may be met by the issuance of a task order during the base period or option period(s).  The resultant contract will contain provisions for a base period of 12-months and four (4) 12-month option periods.  The total value for all contracts inclusive of options will not exceed $30,000,000.  The total term of the contract, including all options, will not exceed 60 months.  Solicitation issue and receipt dates are approximate.

<DESC><strong>Question:</strong> One of the pre-solicitation amendments calls for submission of a small business subcontracting plan. Is there CONUS work contemplated under this contract? If not, it seems that FAR 19.702 (b) (3) would apply which states that a subcontracting plan is not required for contracts "that will be performed entirely outside of the United States and its outlying areas."<br />Please advise if a subcontracting plan is therefore still a requirement.<br /><strong>Answer: </strong>There is no requirement for a subcontracting plan to be submitted in response to the presolicitation notice. Proposal instructions and a Statement of Work will be part of the Solicitation Package, which is classified as Secret. Your question is beyond the scope of the presolicitation notice posting.

<DESC>RECOVERY ACTION.  For informational purposes only.  This is a within scope modification to a competitively awarded IDIQ contract- New Year Tech, HHSN263200800005I, task order LARC-2008-OLAW-0019, line item #2.   This modification provides ARRA funding in the amount of $26,732.55 to support the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare for Option Year 1.  The DUNS number for New Year Tech, Inc. is 17-994-4574.  Contract HHSN263200800005I and awarded task orders under this contract were subject to a Novation Agreement on December 1, 2009.  The DUNS number for the transferee, JS Technology, Inc. is 832328202.  The work scope being accomplished under the task order modification as a result of the receipt of the ARRA funds is within the scope of the contract. The prospects for performing the ARRA scope of work under a firm fixed-price (FFP) contract were evaluated prior issuance of the modification.   The work contemplated varies depending on the influx of ARRA funded grants, making it difficult to accurately estimate the extent or duration of work or to anticipate costs with any reasonable degree of confidence.  (FAR 16.601(c))

Awarded $26,732.55 on 2009/01/27

<DESC>The award is a fixed price award competitively awarded under a group of IDIQ contracts the Program Support Center (PSC) has with various vendors.  Fair opportunity was provided for.

The purpose of this task order contract is to produce information for HHS to draft a Report to Congress on the Application of EHR Payment Incentives for Providers not Receiving Other Incentive Payments mandated in Section 4104(a) of Title IV of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA).  The statute requires that by June 30, 2010 the Secretary of HHS submit to Congress a report on the findings and conclusions of the study to determine the extent to and manner in which payment incentives for implementing and using certified EHR technology should be made available to health care providers who are receiving no or only minimal incentives under HITECH or otherwise.  Upon receipt of the study, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) shall draft a Report for review and clearance in the Department of HHS.   

Section 4104(a) of Title IV of HITECH requires that the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) conduct a study to determine the extent to which and manner in which payment incentives (such as under Medicare or Medicaid) and other funding for purposes of implementing and using certified EHR technology (as defined through HITECH) should be made available to health care providers who are receiving minimal or no payment incentives or other funding under HITECH, Medicare, or Medicaid for such purposes.  The Secretary is required to submit a report to Congress on the findings and conclusions of this study.  The report to Congress is due June 30, 2010.

Specifically, the statute requires that the study examine:
1.	the adoption rates of certified EHR technology by such health care providers;
2.	the clinical utility of such technology by such health care providers; 
3.	whether the services furnished by such health care providers are appropriate for or would benefit from the use of such technology;
4.	the extent to which such health care providers work in settings that might otherwise receive an incentive payment or other funding under HITECH, Medicare, Medicaid, or otherwise;
5.	the potential costs and benefits of making payment incentives and other funding available to such health care providers; and 
6.	any other issues the Secretary deems to be appropriate.
