<DESC>PRESOLICITATION NOTICE ADVISORY MULTI-STEP PROCESS Please read this entire notice carefully as it constitutes the only notice that will be issued regarding the Department of Transportation, Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) Systems Integration Technical Support Services - Advisory Multi-Step Process. This synopsis is issued by GovWorks under the franchise fund authority of the Department of the Interior (DOI) on behalf of the Department of Transportation, Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA).  GovWorks/DOI (GovWorks) intends to award a full-and-open, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract for systems integration technical support services for FMCSA's COMPASS Program, described in the attached COMPASS Program Background document. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541512, Computer Systems Design Services.  The Solicitation/Request for Proposal number is 1435-04-05-RP-43269.  All documents applicable to this pre-solicitation notice will be available via the Internet at http://www.govworks.gov/vendor/csolicit.asp.   Interested parties are invited to respond to this Presolicitation Notice, which is issued following the procedures described under FAR 15.202.  This method also correlates with use of a Statement of Objectives for performance-based support under a single integration support contract for FMCSA's five-year COMPASS Program.  Telephone requests for this Presolicitation Notice cannot be honored and no prospective offerors list shall be maintained.  Please note that no questions will be accepted during Phase 1 of the Advisory Multi-Step Process, described below.  The anticipated solicitation (Phase 2) release date is Mid-June 2005.  Please ensure the Request for Proposal (RFP) number and program title (Systems Integration Technical Support Services - COMPASS) is referenced on all correspondence.   ADVISORY MULTI-STEP PROCESS:  This advisory multi-step process is divided into two (2) phases.  Phase 1 consists of the submission of Vendor Capability Statements, agency evaluations of the capability statements, and subsequent advisory notifications to vendors of their likelihood of being a viable competitor.  Phase 2 consists of the solicitation, proposal evaluation, and award. Phase 1 - Submission of Vendor Capability Statements, Agency Evaluations and Advisory Notifications   This phase includes submissions of Vendor Capability Statements followed by agency evaluations and advisory notifications.  A Program Background document and evaluation criteria are attached for the purpose of providing background information on COMPASS.   A. Submission of Vendor Capability Statements: Interested vendors are invited to submit Capability Statements describing the information requested in the Vendor Capability Statement Instructions below.  Vendor Capability Statements must be submitted via email to Alan.Adrian@mms.gov and Robert.Roberts@mms.gov no later than 4:00 PM, EST Friday May 20th.  Responding to a performance-based solicitation, especially one utilizing a SOO that seeks contractor-developed solutions, requires a significant effort on the part of contractors to propose to the government.  It also requires a substantial effort on the part of the agency's evaluation team to evaluate an array of different approaches or solutions.  Though the advisory notifications are not a competitive range determination, it is the agency's intent and approach to limit the competitive pool to those select few contractors most qualified to offer a successful solution thus limiting the number of contractors that will go through the time, expense, and effort of developing proposals.  Contractors contemplating competing for this performance-based contract award are asked to carefully review the attached COMPASS Program Background, and Capability Statements and Criteria documents to make a realistic self-assessment as to their potential viability.   B.  Agency Evaluations: The Vendor Capability Statements will be evaluated based upon the areas and criteria identified in the Vendor Capability Statements Instructions below.  The agency will complete the Phase 1 advisory multi-step process without communicating with the vendors who provide submissions.  There will be no opportunity for questions during this phase.   C.  Advisory Notifications: GovWorks will issue advisory notifications stating that the respondent will either be invited to participate in the resultant acquisition, or, based on the information submitted, the respondent is unlikely to be a viable competitor.  As explained in FAR 15.202(b), Advisory Multi-Step Process,  "?.The agency shall inform all respondents that, notwithstanding the advice provided by the Government in response to their submissions, they may participate in the resultant acquisition." Phase 2 - Solicitation, Proposal Evaluation and Award of an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract  This phase will be initiated by issuing a formal RFP.  Offerors will be required to submit detailed technical and cost proposals, management plans, proposed performance measures, and subcontracting plans.  The RFP will also identify the first task to be completed.  To ensure that the government receives the best proposal, prospective offerors will be provided an opportunity to participate in a "due diligence" period where prospective offerors meet with key agency representatives to learn as much as possible about FMCSA's programs, mission goals, and requirements in order to develop a competitive solution.  Vendor Capability Statement Instructions and Criteria FMCSA only expects capability statements from qualified prime contractors. The capabilities of any potential sub-contractors or partner's will not be accepted. Please refer to the COMPASS Background document for an overview of the COMPASS initiative and additional context for these criteria.

San Francisco, California - The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) invites the public to a property tour (1st floor and courtyard) at 5:15 pm and a general information meeting at 6:00 p.m. in Room 120 on the 1st Floor of 50 United Nations Plaza, San Francisco, California. The purpose of the meeting is to explain GSA’s proposed process for non-Federal government investment to restore, reuse and long-term lease of the historic Federal office building located at 50 United Nations Plaza. The property would become available for long-term outlease under Section 111 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1976 with any potential uses subject to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. The process will be described under a Request for Qualification and Adaptive Use (RFQ&U) that is to be issued after the public comment period. GSA welcomes public comment and input into the RFQ&U process and will be accepting written comments at the meeting and until June 30, 2005. Written comments can be sent to Zhanna Odesskiy, GSA, Public Building Service, San Francisco Service Cetner, 450 Golden Gate Avenue, 3-E, San Francisco, CA; fax: (415) 522-3116 or email: zhanna.odesskiy@gsa.gov. 

The Federal Office Building at 50 United Nations Plaza is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is an integral part of the Civic Center landmark district. The property was completed in 1936, in a Beaux Arts style, by renowned San Francisco architect, Arthur Brown, Jr., who also designed four other major structures in Civic Center including City Hall. The property, comprises 6 stories of approximately 350,000 gross square feet, is located on the southeast corner of Hyde and McAlister Streets with a main entrance fronting onto United Nations Plaza, a pedestrian mall and open market area.

Since the building is a secured federal facility, all visitors are subject to weapons screening and must present valid California identification such as a Drivers License. Please note that due to security concerns, visitors may not be allowed to enter the property after 6:15 pm.

<DESC>The Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary (sanctuary) encompasses approximately 3,300 square miles off the Washington Coast, extending from Cape Flattery to the mouth of the Copalis River.  Significant natural and cultural resources include 29 species of whales, dolphins and other marine mammals, large populations of nesting seabirds, Native American communities and archaeological sites and some of the last remaining wilderness coastline in the lower 48 states.  The sanctuary provides resource protection through research, education and conservation programs that foster public understanding and stewardship of this nationally significant marine ecosystem.  

The sanctuary is required by law to periodically review its management plan to ensure that the sanctuary continues to best conserve, protect, and enhance its nationally significant living and cultural resources.  The current management plan for the sanctuary was written in 1994 at the time of designation.  Recent scientific discoveries, advancements in managing marine resources, and emerging resource management issues are not addressed in the existing plan.  The sanctuary has begun planning for its upcoming management plan review process that will begin in September 2005.

The sanctuary is in need of meeting support and facilitation services for a number of management plan review (MPR) related activities.  The sanctuary anticipates starting MPR in September, 2005, with the release of a State of the Sanctuary report and community open houses in September 2005 and continuing with scoping meetings beginning in November 2005. The contract will consist of a base and two option years. This requirement will be 100% set-aside for small business. See Numbered Note 1.  For further information please contact Paul Reed at Paul.J.Reed@noaa.gov.

It shall have the capability to request and confirm catering, and capture catering costs, capability to request audiovisual equipment, request accommodations for people with disabilities, and capture multiple room sets.   The system must have the capability to look up an event and have all activities associated with that event (such as catering, audiovisual, conference room booking, etc.).  It must have an administrative function.  It must capture special written instructions to support any request made to the Conference Office. The system must have the capability to notify not only the individual requesting the room, but also the meeting sponsor and the expected attendees at the same time a room change is required or a cancellation occurs.   The contractor must also meet mandatory requirements listed in the RFQ.

For information regarding this solicitation, contact the Contracting Officer Tatea R. Cavanaugh at 202-305-7302, fax number 202-353-7794 or email me at tcavanaugh@central.unicor.gov .  All offerors  must complete an ACH form which can be found on our webpage at www.unicor.gov.   All Offerors must be registered in the CCR database to be considered eligible for award.  If you have not registered in the CCR you may do so by logging onto www.ccr.gov and click on start new registration.  Beginning January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) will require the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your 
information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. Although architect-engineer firms can voluntarily submit the Standard Form (SF) 330 Part II through ORCA, they still must submit this form to each agency for which it wants to be considered for projects that are not publicly announced. To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your companys ID and password into ORCA. (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN).   The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use.  Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional readonly provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status. Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help.Teresa Sorrenti IAE Program Manager Integrated Acquisition Environment 2011 Crystal Drive, Crystal Park 1,  Suite 911, Arlington, VA 22202, Tel.

<DESC>ELECTRONIC RFP ANNOUNCEMENT - The National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health, intends to award a 5-year (inclusive of options) contract, on a SOLE SOURCE basis, under authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1) as set forth in FAR 6.320-1 a database system from The MEDSTAT Group, 801 Crescent Centre Drive, Suite 400; Franklin, TN 37067.  The system is for use by the Office of Communications in continuing its ongoing audience segmentation and consumer profiling efforts.  The data provided are obtained using primary survey research on actionable healthcare issues with annual sample sizes of 100,000 households.  There is also the ability to access over 10 years of primary source consumer health care utilization trend data (over one million respondents), as well as the ability to add cancer-related questions to the contractor’s annual survey.  Additional research from other sources (public, private, and proprietary) is used to produce a fully comprehensive audience segmentation system.  The database system integrates the following components: 1) The PULSE Health Care Survey:  An annual national random-sample survey of approximately 100,000 heads-of-household covering sixty (60) major health care categories.  Survey analysis includes nationally weighted response rates for each survey question, as well as for each of the two neighborhood-level databases described below.  2) A neighborhood level market segmentation system: The system includes a license to use the PRIZM NE classification system from Claritas Corporation which classifies each of the census defined neighborhoods (Block Groups and Enumeration Districts) into one of 66 national neighborhood types.  The system also includes the classification for all neighborhoods in the geographical area covered by the system at the Block Group, Tract and ZIP level.  It also includes profiles of the consumer and media behavior of each of the 66 neighborhood types based on national syndicated surveys. 3) Neighborhood level demographic databases: The system includes a complete set of demographic data (150 data items) on each county, ZIP code, census tract, and block group/enumeration district within the local market area. 4) Media use optimizer: The system includes the ability to estimate the utilization of different types of media and product buying habits by lifestyle cluster and pair this information with health care utilization and health status information. 5) Advanced mapping/graphics: The system includes the ability to display on the computer screen and print the boundaries for counties, ZIP codes, and census tracts in any geographic area covered by the system.  Areas can be shaded based on any variable chosen from the databases (e.g., lifestyle clusters with below average mammography utilization rates), and/or each area can be labeled with the value of any variable from the databases.  In addition, this software allows for the overlay of streets, labels (e.g., zip codes, county names) and landmarks such as hospitals.  6)  Online access:  The entire system is accessible through the Internet so NCI can receive continuous updates to the system without having to upgrade its computer systems.  7) Decision support: The system includes stored applications intended to assist marketers and planners in evaluating options involved in marketing and strategic planning for reaching consumers, health providers and managed care organizations.  These stored applications include the retrieval and comparison of data, the preparation of maps, and the display of data in graphic formats. 9) Research support: the contractor will provide additional technical support such as identifying specific data sets and variables within data sets to further NCI’s behavioral research projects and develop upon request databases in the format for analysis of multiple variables over time. 10) Intranet application: Medstat will develop and deliver a custom, tailored, stand-alone intranet-based application with specifications which will provide regional offices of the Cancer Information Service with the ability to develop custom maps and reports using predefined, stored applications.   In addition, NCI has the ability to modify, expand, copy and/or add new “stored applications” to the system.  The planned period of performance is 5-year (inclusive of options).  Due to the proprietary nature of much of the data, as well as the integration of the all software components into one system, there is no other known vendor to provide the above data requirements.  It is the Government’s belief that the above specifications can only be met by The MEDSTAT Group.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS; however, if an interested party believes they can meet the above specifications, they may submit a statement of capability.  Information furnished should include enough material, in sufficient detail, to perform a proper evaluation of their ability to perform.  Closing date is 45 days after publication of this notice.  SEE NOTE 22.  This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract.

<DESC>The Geothermal Program Office (GPO) of the U.S. Navy is seeking an independent analysis of the hydrogeology of the area known as the Coso Hot Springs, located in the Coso Range, Naval Air Weapons Station, China Lake, CA.  The Coso Geothermal Area has been the subject of both occasional and intensive study over the past 90 years, but no compelling hydrogeologic model has emerged that clearly explains the relationship between major surface thermal features and the deep geothermal resource that is being used to generate electricity in nearby power plants.  Specifically the study shall describe any influence on Coso Hot Springs from activities related to geothermal power production in the adjacent Coso Geothermal Field.  The work performed under this contract will attempt to provide a comprehensive model that: explains the occurrence and movement of subterranean waters; the mechanical, chemical, and thermal interaction of this water with the porous and permeable medium; and the transport of energy and chemical constituents related thereto.  As described in the edited list of relevant publications provided in this solicitation, there are numerous data sets available for the area including more than 20 years of monitoring reports, compiled and interpreted by personnel of the U.S. Navy Geothermal Program Office, its contractors, and independent scientific investigators.  These resources will be made available to the successful offeror to utilize in completing the work.  The study must address all aspects of the Coso Range hydrologic environment including the non-geothermal, high-desert hydrogeology, both shallow local and deep regional hydrology, as well as the geothermal elements of the overlying Coso geothermal field.  As appropriate, and required to, acknowledge the importance of the neotectonic setting in which the Coso Hot Springs is located, the proposal shall incorporate known structural and tectonic findings into the hydrogeology model.  This study must be completed in one year or less from date of contract award, and the required products will be: (1) A technical report fully documenting the detailed hydrogeologic model as well as all analyses, syntheses, assumptions and processes that contributed to the model.  (2) A less-technically oriented summary report that shall be written and illustrated such that the scientific processes, modeling and conclusions of the study can be readily understood by the general public.  PROPOSAL EVALUATION - A team of Navy technical experts in the geosciences will conduct the evaluations of all proposals, and make recommendations to the source selection authority for contract award.  - The criteria listed below will be the basis for proposal evaluation and selection.  Overall scientific and technical merit of the proposed work is substantially more important than the other criteria.  All other criteria are of equal importance.  Price will be a factor in determining contract award, but it will not be the sole criterion.  The Navy intends to award a contract to the proposal that offers the best value: Scientific and technical merit of the work proposed.  Demonstrated understanding of, and familiarity with, hydrothermal systems.  Capabilities and related experience of key personnel in the technical areas being proposed, foremost of which is hydrogeology; realism and reasonableness of the proposed costs.  All information in response to this notification must be submitted in writing to Deborah Green, Contract Specialist, deborah.green@navy.mil

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD), China Lake, CA intends to procure on an other than full and open competition basis, cylindrical elevation beam scanning antennas utilizing Continuous Transverse Stub (CTS) technology with Raytheon Network Centric Systems 1001 Boston Post Road, Marlborough, MA 01752-3789.  Negotiations will be conducted with Raytheon Corporation, who has acquired licensing rights to the CTS technology for commercial and Department of Defense (DoD) use.  The antenna subsystem will be a critical subsystem component in a current Government development project.  This work procured under this effort will depend heavily on antenna design work performed under contract N68936-02-C-0035.  Raytheon is currently developing a cylindrical CTS antenna as a subcontract effort under contract N68936-02-C-0035.  There are four principal tasks associated with this procurement.  They are 1) the modification of a previously developed CTS antenna design!  to accommodate changed performance parameters, 2) the development of an elevation scanning mechanism, 3) the integration and test of the completed antenna subsystem assembly, and 4) the documentation of the design.  Under the proposed contract, the Navy will procure three Engineering Development Model (EDM) antennas, with options to procure up to 75 production antennas.  The 75 production antennas will use the design of the three EDM antennas.  A Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) type contract is contemplated.  Raytheon is the only known firm with the required expertise to accomplish the proposed design, development, and fabrication efforts.  Any firm believing that they can provide required services, may submit a written response, which shall be considered, clearly showing their ability to perform the work.  Responses shall be made in writing to Commander, Code 210000D, Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD), 429 East Bowen Road Stop 4015 China Lake, CA 93555-6108, At! tn: Paul Barnhurst or by e-mail: paul.barnhurst@navy.mil or by fax at (760) 939-3095 Place of Performance = Contractor Facility Set Aside = N/A NAICS Code = 334511

San Francisco, California - The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) invites the public to a property tour (1st floor and courtyard) at 5:15 pm and a general information meeting on Wednesday, June 15, 2005 at 6:00 p.m. in Room 120 on the 1st Floor of 50 United Nations Plaza, San Francisco, California. The purpose of the meeting is to explain GSA’s proposed process for non-Federal government investment to restore, reuse and long-term lease of the historic Federal office building located at 50 United Nations Plaza. The property would become available for long-term outlease under Section 111 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1976 with any potential uses subject to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. The process will be described under a Request for Qualification and Adaptive Use (RFQ&U) that is to be issued after the public comment period. GSA welcomes public comment and input into the RFQ&U process and will be accepting written comments at the meeting and until June 30, 2005.

The Federal Office Building at 50 United Nations Plaza is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is an integral part of the Civic Center landmark district. The property was completed in 1936, in a Beaux Arts style, by renowned San Francisco architect, Arthur Brown, Jr., who also designed four other major structures in Civic Center including City Hall. The property, comprises 6 stories of approximately 350,000 gross square feet, is located on the southeast corner of Hyde and McAllister Streets with a main entrance fronting onto United Nations Plaza, a pedestrian mall and open market area.

Since the building is a secured federal facility, all visitors are subject to weapons screening and must present valid California identification such as a Drivers License. Please note that due to security concerns, visitors may not be allowed to enter the property after 6:15 pm.

<DESC>This procurement is set-aside for small businesses.  The NAICS code is 611430 and the SIC Code is R799.  The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) intends to issue a Commercial Services,  Fixed-Price contract for providing Leadership Training and Development Programs.   The period of performance will be for a one-year base period and four option years.  The full scope of work anticipated will be set forth in the statement of work (SOW) of the solicitation document that will be posted no later than Friday, December 17, 2004.  Offerors are advised that hard copies of the solicitation will not be made available as the entire document will be posted on FedBizOpps.  The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) licenses and inspects nuclear reactors, materials, and waste facilities to ensure compliance with applicable codes and standards during all phases of construction, testing, and decommissioning operations to protect the public health and safety and the environment from the effects of radiation.  To further its mission, the Commission conducts training programs for its managers, supervisors, and other staff that are designed to strengthen the participants’ effectiveness and efficiency in their current positions and to develop their skills and knowledge for future work activities.   For over 25 years, the NRC has conducted a variety of in-house supervisory, managerial, technical, and professional development programs. Since 2001, NRC has conducted three,12-month Leadership Development Programs (LPP) to train individuals (Grades 13 - 15) for supervisory positions and two,18-month Senior Executive Service Candidate Development Programs (SESCDPs), with an SESCDP for 31 individuals currently being implemented. Approximately 65 individuals have completed the LPP and 50 have completed the SESCDPs. These programs are functioning effectively and major changes to them are not anticipated.  The services called for under this contract will be offered at NRC Headquarters and its four regional offices, except for those pertaining to the SESCDP and LPP, which are normally conducted in Headquarters.  In 2004, the NRC completed a Training Needs Assessment (TNA) to review the content of the most frequently instructed in-house, NRC courses offered to Grades 7 - SES. The contractor may be requested to revise, as needed, and instruct, the following courses that were reviewed in the TNA: Coaching and Counseling Skills for Managers (2 days), Conducting and Participating in Meetings, (2 days), Effective Communication for NRC Inspectors (3 days), Effective Oral Presentations (3 days), Facilitation Techniques Workshop (2 days), Gathering Inspection Information Through Interviews (2 days), Human Resources Management Practices (2 days), Interviewing Skills and Techniques for Recruiters (1 day), Leading NRC Work Teams (2 days), Managing Change (2 days), Media Training (2 days), Negotiating Techniques: How to Gain Agreement (2 days),  Management Workshop--Exploring Emotional Intelligence (2 days), Performance Appraisal (1 day), Public Outreach Meetings (2 days), Selection Interviewing Workshop (2 days), Situational Leadership (1 day), Small Group Dynamics (2 - 3 days), Supervising Human Resources (5 days), and Technical Writing for Supervisors and their Staff (1 day).  The TNA reviewed the Participant Handbook for each course (the courses did not have Instructor Guides) to identify the following elements: learning objectives, course content for each learning objective, Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Leadership Competencies covered in each course, the relationship of content to level of learning as identified in Bloom’s Taxonomy, sequencing and content flow, and instructional methods.  The TNA, which will be available to the contractor upon award, includes an analysis of the findings for each of the above elements.  In Fiscal Years 2003 and 2004, 32 separate technical and leadership courses were offered in-house, with each course presented two to eight times during each fiscal year.  Twenty-three out of the 32 courses offered were leadership courses.  We anticipate this level of effort to continue over the next five years.  Contracting services are needed to instruct the 23 leadership courses, as well as, the other activities described in the SOW.   This is not a request for proposal and responses to this notice are not required at this time.  Questions concerning this announcement should be addressed via e-mail to cac3@nrc.gov.

<DESC>NOTICE OF UNSOLICITED PROPOSAL.  The Health Resources & Services Administration (HRSA) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, with the Arizona Department of Health Services, Phoenix, AZ  85007.  This procurement will be processed in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13.  The purpose of this acquisition is to conduct a pilot test in which dental hygienists function as case workers to track referral and treatment for comprehensive oral health care for Head Start Children.  The contractor will share their data on the effectiveness of implementing the Head Start Triage System for Early Head Start Children age’s zero to three, their implementation manuals for the program, and their findings. Because the program is based on an unsolicited proposal, which the Government has determined  to be an unique and innovative approach that was independently originated and developed by the offeror; without the Government’s supervision; benefits the Agency’s mission, and was not an advance proposal for a known agency requirement, the Arizona Department of Health Services is deemed the only responsible source capable of providing the required work and service under authority in 41 U.S.C. 253(d) (1) A, as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(a)(2) (i)(A).  The Contractor has spent a substantial amount of effort in developing the pilot and will do this work with a large portion of the effort as an in-kind contribution.  Any other source would have to duplicate a substantial variety of current and previous efforts to accomplish the same objectives.  The anticipated period of performance is for twelve (12) months.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 541990. This announcement is for information only.  NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE.  The reference number is #05-S240-0265(DLC).

5.	GENERAL DESIGN
The soft body armor shall be designed for regular daily wear.  There¬fore, vests shall be designed and constructed to provide (1) light and thin NIJ 0101.04 certified armor in Level IIIA, (2) durability, (3) ease of cleaning, (4) minimum restric¬tion of motion or mobility, and (5) the greatest amount of ballistic coverage consistent with comfort.

The general configuration shall be the slipover vest type that covers the majority of the upper torso, including side coverage.  Eight elastic straps with hook and pile fasteners shall provide proper positioning and comfort.  The entire vest perimeter shall be curved.  No sharp corners shall be allowed.

The front ballistic panel shall cover the chest approximately up to the collar bone, have a scooped neck sufficient to maintain comfort when worn, extend downward to the waist but not far enough to "push up into the throat" when the wearer is seated, and extend around the sides to provide side protection.  The biceps/chest region shall be cut with suffi¬cient space to minimize irritation and restric¬tion of arm movement during driving, climbing, shooting or other mission essential duties. 

The rear ballistic panel shall cover the back of the torso from just above the shoulder blades down to a position above the waist belt.  

Each set of soft body armor shall include the following:

In relation to areal density, a vest section of 12" x 12" (one square foot) [30.5cm x 30.5cm], must not exceed 14.56 oz. ( .91 lbs.) per square foot for NIJ level IIIA.      


8. BALLISTIC PANEL PERFOR¬MANCE
 V-50 Performance
The V-50 test shall be performed in accordance with MIL-STD-662F using NIJ Standard 0101.04 9mm 124 grain FMJ test projectiles.  The test must be performed by an indepen¬dent laboratory approved by the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) National Law Enforcement Technol¬ogy ¬¬Center (NLETC) for testing in ac¬cor¬dance with NIJ Standard 0101.04.  The V-50 test shall be against clay backing. V-50 reports which represent testing without clay backing shall be rejected.  Vendor shall provide written certification that all V-50 testing is accomplished with clay backing; failure to provide certification shall be cause for rejection. 

Test reports shall reflect the following minimum test results for a 14.56 oz. ( .91 lbs.) per square foot [12” x 12”] test sample.  This “V-50”number is reflected as the ballistic limit average in the NIJ compliance statement on the “Ballistic limit summary” page.

Bullet	9mm V-50

<DESC>The purpose of the Design Manual was to compile the information available at that time on the design, construction, maintenance and monitoring of coal waste impoundments, as no such compilation was previously available.  The manual provided a source of information that assisted all involved parties - coal companies, engineering consultants, and government regulators - in carrying out their responsibilities to help ensure that safe impoundments were designed and constructed.  The original manual was sold by the Government Printing Office, but has not been available for many years.   

In the 30 years since the publication of the Design Manual, significant changes have occurred in the fields of coal waste disposal and dam safety.  Changes have included:
the occurrence of several incidents where impounded slurry (fine coal waste) has broken
into underground mine workings; construction of slurry disposal impoundments to
to unprecedented heights using upstream construction methods; the availability of
information on the engineering behavior and properties of coal waste materials, and 
thirty years of impoundment-performance history. Advances in technical knowledge
related to the safe design and construction of dams and impoundments. The use of new 
construction products, such as geotextiles, synthetic drainage materials, and plastic pipe, that were not used prior to 1975. The entry of different engineering consulting firms
 performing impoundment-related work. 

MSHA regulates coal mining impoundments under the standards contained in 30 CFR 77.216 through 77.216-5.  MSHA’s responsibilities include: reviewing and approving the plans for the design, construction, and modification of impoundments; ensuring that coal companies routinely inspect the impoundments for signs of instability; obtaining annual reports and certifications on impoundment conditions; requiring that impoundments be properly abandoned or transferred to other responsible parties when mining activities are completed; and periodically inspecting impoundments for compliance with the approved plan and for signs of instability.  Among other specific requirements, the standards require that plans submitted to MSHA for approval include a certification by a registered engineer that the design of the impounding structure is in accordance with current, prudent engineering practice for the maximum volume that can be impounded and for passage of storm runoff.  Offerors who are interested in being included on the solicitation mailing list must submit  a written request to: Irving M. McCrae, Contracting Officer, Acquisition Management division, Room 2173, Mine Safety and Health
Administration, 1100 Wilson Blvd., Arlington, VA 22209, (202) 693-9837, mccrae-irving@ dol.gov. Phone requests will not be accepted. All responses should be received within 14 of this notice.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The US Army Communications-Electronics Command (CECOM) Acquisition Center-Washington, on behalf of the RDECOM CERDEC Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD), Countermine Division, Humanitarian Demining Team, plans to negotiate a sole source contract with Stolar Research Corporation for the enhancement of Electromagnetic wave Detection and Imaging Transceiver (EDIT) landmine detector in an effort to increase its probability of detection and reduce false alarm rate.   The EDIT landmine d etector was developed by Stolar Research Corporation formally known as Raton Technology Research under the US Humanitarian Demining Program to detect and image of shallow-buried metallic and nonmetallic landmines.   The EDIT landmine detector is a handheld  detector and features a detection sensor which based upon the application of a Resonant Microstrip Patch Antenna (RMPA); an imaging that displays the change in the impedance of RMPA from its calibrated value to form real-time silhouettes of buried objects ; a tracking of a sensor head within survey area; and powered by 12V rechargeable battery.  The sensor head-tracking feature provides an additional benefit of showing the operator if an area has been missed during the scan of the suspect area.    The contractor shall be tasked to improve the overall performance of the EDIT landmine detector and this enhancement effort includes the following tasks: 1) Integrate frequency modulated continuous wave radar capability into existing EDIT system and electr onics, 2) Replace existing digital signal processing board with newer more powerful board and develop associated software, 3) Upgrade head-tracking positional sensors, 4) Develop self-diagnostic subsystem to monitor sensor head performance, 5) Improve imag e processing and target characterization software, 6) Develop PDA software for user interface, and 7) Conduct multiple data collections at Government designated test sites. It has been determined that Stolar Research Corporation is the Only One Responsible Source and no other Supplies or Services will satisfy Agency Requirements.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304 (c)(1); Only One  Responsible Source and no Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  However, all responsible sources that can provide supporting data to demonstrate they can successfully provided the required EDIT Landmine Detector improvements may su bmit a quote that shall be considered by the agency.  Responses should be no longer than ten (10) pages.  The resultant contract will be cost-plus-fixed-fee.  Responses are to be received via email within 45 calendar days of the date of this notice.  All r equests for further information must be in writing and via email, telephone requests for additional information will not be honored. You may forward responses to the following e-mail address: andrew.chappell@cacw.army.mil.  Acknowledgement of receipt will be issued.  See Numbered Note 22.

It shall not be used as a proposal. You will not be entitled to any reimbursement f or costs associated with responding.  All inputs will be handled with strict confidentiality. The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), acting on behalf of the Air Force Real Property Agency (AFRPA), intends to award up to three Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contracts for environmental remediation projects at the former Gr iffiss Air Force Base (AFB) in Rome, NY. This solicitation is expected to be published in late June 2005 with target date for contractor selection in late September or early October 2005. At this point in time, USACE expects this solicitation to be issued as a full and open competition solicitation under NAICS Code 562910 and in accordance with the BRAC requirements found in DFARS 226.7102. USACE expects to publish the Pre-Solicitation Notification within the next 30 days.   One of the projects that is being contemplated for award under the IDIQ is remediation for site closure of five contaminated groundwater sites known as the On Base Groundwater Area of Concern (AOC) of the former AFB: Apron 2, Landfill 6, Weapons Storage Ar ea (WSA), WSA Landfill, and Building 775/Pumphouse 3. Note that some of these sites may include property no longer owned or controlled by the government (e.g. Building 775/Pumphouse 3); however, deed restrictions allow access for the purpose of conducting environmental remediation activities. At this point in time, plans for reuse of the sites include industrial/commercial property, airfield support activities or open space.

UPDATE 21 March 2005:  Proposal due date information is changed as follows:   If the RFP is not released by 1 April 2005, there will be a day for day slip  in the proposal due date.   Also, information about the Past Performance volume due date is changed to  read as follows: Each offeror is requested to submit the Past Performance volume for relevant  Government contracts 28 days prior to the date established for receipt of  proposals.  Failure to submit early proposal information (Past Performance  volume) will not result in offeror disqualification.

You must submit a copy of your approved DD Form 2345, Military  Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your proposal. REQUIREMENTS DESCRIPTION: We anticipate award of a Pre-System Development and Demonstration (Pre-SDD)  contract in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15 for  a Lead System Integrator in the July 2005 timeframe.  This Lead System  Integrator must possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to be Lead  System Integrator of the B-52 SOJ component of the Airborne Electronic Attack  (AEA) System of Systems (SoS) for use by United States Air Force (USAF)  personnel.  The nature of this effort will require access to SECRET or higher  and NOFORN material.   Background The B-52 SOJ will be a core component of the AEA System of Systems.  Other key  AEA components are anticipated to include a jammer variant of the Miniature  Air Launched Decoy (MALD), EC-130H with enhanced jamming pods (Compass Call),  inherent EA capability of Active Electronically Scanned Arrays (AESA) on board  F/A-22s, F-35s, and other AESA-equipped aircraft, the Navy+s EA-6B Improved  Capability III (ICAP III) and EA-18G, and the network/protocols to link these  capabilities.  Some of the key technologies that will be involved include, but  are not limited to: sensitive accurate direction finding Radio Frequency (RF)  receivers, high power relatively broad band directional RF transmitters,  appropriate command and control and on-scene (local) electronic attack (EA)  asset management functions, line-of-sight and beyond line-of-sight networking,  and advanced electronic warfare techniques generation and integration.  A  detailed overview of the B-52 SOJ will be presented at the B-52 Stand-off  Jammer Pre-Solicitation Conference to be held at Wright-Patterson AFB on 16 –  17 Feb 2005.  Additional information for the Pre-Solicitation Conference will  be added to this site as soon as possible.  Further data can be obtained from  the points of contact listed at the bottom of this announcement. Current Environment Concept refinement of the AEA SoS and, in turn, B-52 SOJ, is in process.  An  AEA Analysis of Alternatives was completed in 2001 and forms the basis for  overall AEA capability requirements.  An Initial Capabilities Document (ICD)  for AEA was approved by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council in Nov 2004.   The B-52H, in its fourth decade of operational service, provides the country  with immediate nuclear and conventional global power projection. There are  presently 93 aircraft in service, operating from two Main Operating Bases  (Minot AFB and Barksdale AFB) with the exception of two stationed at Edwards  AFB for flight testing.  Several modifications are underway or planned for the  B-52H to increase or sustain its capabilities.  A key requirement of the SOJ  is that it shall not degrade any current capabilities on the B-52H.  In  addition, the SOJ design and modification will need to be integrated with  other on-going B-52H modifications.   Contract Descriptions The objective for award of the pre-SDD contract is fourth quarter FY05.   The  approximately 2-year period of performance would include identifying and  evaluating existing technologies and associated suppliers needed to meet SOJ  requirements; reducing the risk or developing a plan for managing the risk  associated with those technologies in SDD; assisting the Air Force in planning  for SDD (including developing spiral development strategies, if applicable)  and accomplishing B-52 SOJ Milestone B (approval for entry into the SDD  phase), and other related tasks.   The Lead System Integrator will be expected to develop and execute a best  value strategy to manage the risks associated with selecting, integrating, and  sustaining SOJ components of varying technological maturity into a cohesive,  scalable/expandable B-52 subsystem.  The Government will require insight into  the integrating contractor’s subcontract and vendor selection process and  decision methodology.  The integrating contractor will be expected to execute,  in partnership with the Air Force, a robust systems engineering process that  includes subcontractors and vendors and to perform all planning necessary to  be able to field and sustain the SOJ capability following its development.   The SOJ capability will complement and shall not degrade the aircraft’s strike  (both nuclear and non-nuclear) capabilities.  Full weapons carriage capability  shall be maintained.  Lastly, it is recognized that because of the B-52  experience and expertise that the Boeing Co. (the B-52 OEM) has built up over  the years, that its involvement will be necessary.  Thus, the Lead System  Integrator will be expected to interface with the Boeing Company or provide a  realistic plan describing how the bidder would accomplish the objectives of  the program without a Boeing interface.

<DESC>The Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NFEC), Southwest (SW), San Diego, California, is preparing to release a Request for Proposal (RFP) for Remedial Action Contract (RAC IV) for Environmental Remediation Services at various Department of Defense (DoD) sites in Alaska, Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and other DoD sites nationwide as deemed necessary to meet workload requirements.  The resulting Contract will be a Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF), Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract with a ceiling of $100,000,000.

This procurement is unrestricted for competition amongst all interested firms.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code applicable to this requirement is 562910, Environmental Remediation Service. 

Typical tasks that may be performed under the resulting contract include environmental remedial design, remedial actions, removal actions, and remedial action systems operation and maintenance.  Remedial actions may include, but will not be limited to, capping landfills, pump-and-treat remediation, bioremediation, soil vapor extraction, natural attenuation, bioventing, air sparging, thermal treatment, phytoremediation, soil washing, and free product recovery.  Some sites may require remediation of radiological or ordnance waste.  Additional work may include: expedited and emergency response actions; pilot and treatability studies, and other related activities associated with returning sites to safe and acceptable levels of contamination.  The contaminants may include, but are not limited to, those identified and regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), Solid Waste Disposal Act (SWDA), and petroleum oils and lubricants (POL).  

Formal source selection procedures will be followed as prescribed by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15 and FAR Supplement as applicable.  A contract will be awarded to the responsible firm whose proposal, conforms to the solicitation, and is determined the "Best Value" to the Government based on cost and non—cost factors.  The resulting contract will be awarded for a base period of one year with four one-year option periods.  FAR Clause 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services will be included in the resulting contract.  The Government intends to award one contract with the proposed Task Order 0001.  The Government reserves the right not to award the proposed Task Order 0001 identified in the solicitation or to award it at a later date after award of the basic contract.  The minimum guarantee of $200,000 applies to the five-year term of the contract.  The aggregate value of delivery orders issued under the contract will not exceed $100,000,000.

Proposals will be evaluated based on the following evaluation factors:  Factor 1 - Past Performance, Factor 2 – Commitment to Socio-Economic Programs, Factor 3 - Specialized Experience, Factor 4 – Contract Management and Approach, Factor 5 – Financial Management Systems, and Factor 6 - Technical Approach (Proposed Task Order 0001).  All technical evaluation factors other than cost or price when combined are significantly more important than Factor 7 – Cost/Price.  While cost/price to the Government is a consideration, it will not be the overriding basis for contract award.  The proposed cost/price, and other non-price factors will be evaluated to determine the most advantageous proposal to the Government.  Therefore, the Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest cost/price proposal.  

A pre-proposal site visit for the Proposed Task Order 0001 project will be held at the Hunters Point Shipyard (HPS), San Francisco, CA.  The site visit has been scheduled for 12 May 2005 at 9:00 a.m.  All firms interested in attending the site visit must submit the following information by email to Beatrice.appling@navy.mil no later than 5 May 2005:  Full name of individual(s) attending, position/title, company name, citizenship, email address, phone and fax numbers.

<CONTACT>Deborah Green, Contract Specialist, Phone 805-982-2680, Fax 805-982-4540, Email deborah.green@navy.mil
<DESC>The Geothermal Program Office (GPO) of the U.S. Navy is seeking an independent analysis of the hydrogeology of the area known as the Coso Hot Springs, located in the Coso Range, Naval Air Weapons Station, China Lake, CA.  The Coso Geothermal Area has been the subject of both occasional and intensive study over the past 90 years, but no compelling hydrogeologic model has emerged that clearly explains the relationship between major surface thermal features and the deep geothermal resource that is being used to generate electricity in nearby power plants.  Specifically the study shall describe any influence on Coso Hot Springs from activities related to geothermal power production in the adjacent Coso Geothermal Field.  The work performed under this contract will attempt to provide a comprehensive model that: explains the occurrence and movement of subterranean waters; the mechanical, chemical, and thermal interaction of this water with the porous and permeable medium; and the transport of energy and chemical constituents related thereto.  As described in the edited list of relevant publications provided in this solicitation, there are numerous data sets available for the area including more than 20 years of monitoring reports, compiled and interpreted by personnel of the U.S. Navy Geothermal Program Office, its contractors, and independent scientific investigators.  These resources will be made available to the successful offeror to utilize in completing the work.  The study must address all aspects of the Coso Range hydrologic environment including the non-geothermal, high-desert hydrogeology, both shallow local and deep regional hydrology, as well as the geothermal elements of the overlying Coso geothermal field.  As appropriate, and required to, acknowledge the importance of the neotectonic setting in which the Coso Hot Springs is located, the proposal shall incorporate known structural and tectonic findings into the hydrogeology model.  This study must be completed in one year or less from date of contract award, and the required products will be: (1) A technical report fully documenting the detailed hydrogeologic model as well as all analyses, syntheses, assumptions and processes that contributed to the model.  (2) A less-technically oriented summary report that shall be written and illustrated such that the scientific processes, modeling and conclusions of the study can be readily understood by the general public.  PROPOSAL EVALUATION - A team of Navy technical experts in the geosciences will conduct the evaluations of all proposals, and make recommendations to the source selection authority for contract award.  - The criteria listed below will be the basis for proposal evaluation and selection.  Overall scientific and technical merit of the proposed work is substantially more important than the other criteria.  All other criteria are of equal importance.  Price will be a factor in determining contract award, but it will not be the sole criterion.  The Navy intends to award a contract to the proposal that offers the best value: Scientific and technical merit of the work proposed.  Demonstrated understanding of, and familiarity with, hydrothermal systems.  Capabilities and related experience of key personnel in the technical areas being proposed, foremost of which is hydrogeology; realism and reasonableness of the proposed costs.  All information in response to this notification must be submitted in writing to Deborah Green, Contract Specialist, deborah.green@navy.mil  The purpose of this amendment is to add the following: The solicitation will be posted at the following Internet address http://esol.navfac.navy.mil and to change the following: the date for posting will be on or about 22 April 2005.  In accordance with FAR 5.102 this solicitation will only be available electronically.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541910    The Requst for Quote can be viewed at the following site: http://www.epa.gov/oamhpod1/adm_placement/sapcbd/nolte.pdf The response due date for Solicitation RFQ-DC-05-00201 is hereby extended to Friday, May 27, 2005 at 12:00pm EST. Please e-mail responses to the  Contracting Officer. No more questions will be accepted. QUESTIONS FOR RFQ: External Expertise to Develop Questionnaire For Aging Initiative Prepare a questionnaire of at least 20 questions that captures the importance of smart growth principals that are of most importance to enhancing the  quality of life for older adults.  Questions should not be open-ended since they will be placed on a website and results will be automatically tabulated. Q.	Who specifically would that survey be administered to?   A.	The decision on who would complete the survey has not been finalized.  It is most  likely that local officials will be responsible for completing the survey for their communities.    Q.	Would all questions apply / be valid for all respondents? (See bottom section this page).   A.	There will likely a primary set of questions for all respondents with a sub- set of questions based  on population density.   Q.	Is the survey is to be administered via the internet? A.	Yes.  Q.	Describe / explain the requirements for website posting of the results. What type and level of security / passwords are required?  (i.e. Multiple people get access to different types of data, or  everything is visible to all audiences). A.	Not applicable.  Outside the scope of work. Work with the Project Officer to determine 20 pilot communities to test the survey tool.  Both urban and rural communities will need to be involved in the testing. Identify at least 100 communities across the  United States that would be likely candidates for participating. Q. 	How will those communities be determined?  What are the criteria?  Are we talking about a one hour conversation about a number of communities, or will we first have to research various communities in order to gather the criteria  to make this decision?	 A.	This is to be worked out at a future point in time between the Project Officer and the Consultant.  Work with the Aging and Smart Growth Network to solicit their input into the recognition program.  Include for example:  Grant-makers in aging, the Leadership Council of  Aging Organizations; the Smart Growth Network; State Offices on Aging; Departs of Health and Environment. Q.	Are these the people who will answer the 20 question survey that we designed? A.	No. Q.	Will we be given the names and titles of qualified respondents to survey?  A.	No. Q.	Will we have  phone and/or email addresses for them?  If not, how do we locate / identify the correct qualified respondent?  A.	No. Q.	Any input that would help us determine how large the universe of these qualified persons is?  In order for the results to be projectable, we need to determine the minimum sample  size (# of people answering the survey) to replicate the universe.    A.	The contractor should have the knowledge of the smart growth and aging networks to respond to this question.  The survey will likely be for local communities to complete. Q.	Are there any sub-groups of these people that  should be sampled (i.e.  Interview at least X number of Director Level people and Y number of Manager level, or perhaps interview X number of people from each of 18 regions). A.	This solicitation requires the consultant to be familiar with these groups and able to  develop a plan as to whom should  be reached.     Prepare a one-page fact sheet describing the purpose and merits of the National Recognition Program. Q.	Is this fact sheet based solely upon the summary results of the survey or does it need to include other information? A.	This fact sheet would not be solely based on the results  of the survey, rather it would explain why one should take the survey.  Develop a question and answer materials (sic) describing "What's in it for me from a community, aging and organizational perspective". Q.	Is this a PR task or more research? A.	This task is not research.  It is to assist in  the education and outreach for the public regarding the recognition program. Prepare launch for the National Recognition Program for early 2006. Q.	What tasks does this statement imply?   A.	Prepare a plan of action to implement the National Recognition Program.   Work with Project Officer to  propose an options list of potential events that could raise awareness of the website and maximize the number of communities that agree to participate in the first year. Q.	Is this a PR task or do intend to purchase media or use PSA's? A.	This is a task for the applicant to propose how to proceed  on raising awareness of the program.

<DESC>SCOPE OF WORK 

The USDA, Office of International Research Progrmams are seeking sources for the following: Technicial Assistance in Integrated Water Management Research, Watershed Revegetation and Sediment, in Pakistan.

BACKGROUND 
Pakistan has suffered from many prolonged droughts over the past 45 years.  Rainfall in the region is erratic and scanty.  The rivers continually flow at subsided levels.  The water in Tarbela dam reaches the “dead” level almost every year in February and March, and these are crucial months for irrigation of wheat and cotton crops.  There is a major dependence on subsurface irrigation water to meet shortages.  Barren watersheds are being eroded and these sediments find their way into Pakistani reservoirs and rivers, depriving Pakistan of necessary water storage capacity needed for household and industry consumption and agricultural irrigation.  Storage capacity of these reservoirs is being decreased at the rate of about one percent per year. Other results of decreased vegetation are reduced fixation of carbon by photosynthesis in these regions, more rapid runoff and flash floods, which destroy property and life.

Under an Interagency Acquisition Agreement (IAA) between the U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs (OES), and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service (ARS), dated 08-17-2004, the ARS is to furnish support of scientific, technological or environmental initiatives in Pakistan.  Under the IAA, ARS will 1.) Assess Pakistan's needs in integrated water management and determine the areas in which Pakistan and the U.S. may benefit by future cooperative research and/or technology transfer; and 2.) Achieve technology and information transfer by assisting Pakistani researchers to become acquainted with current ARS research in the appropriate areas of interest. This is to be accomplished by visiting ARS research stations and commercial applications and observing and studying these projects, and 3.) Assist Pakistani researchers to tailor applicable technologies to local Pakistani circumstances.

OBJECTIVES

The purpose of this purchase order is to provide short-term Technical Assistance in Integrated Water Management Research, Watershed Revegetation and Sediment Control, in Pakistan.







TASKS 

The contractor shall analyze:

1.Provide technical advice to the Pakistan Council for Research in Water Resources PCRWR) with whom OES and ARS have an established partnership.  The echnical assistance will focus on the reduction of sediment movement into Pakistani watersheds.  Attention to be given on the interaction between water availability and use and the environment and agricultural production on irrigated croplands, rain fed croplands, and grazinglands at field, farm, and watershed scales.  Research on watershed management will promote more effective use of precipitation, optional allocation and improved assessment of available water esources, and hydraulic advances in integrated ecosystem management. Future technical assistance will also focus on improving the hydraulic efficiency and safety of structures used to store and regulate water flows.  

2.Determine whether hedges of Saccharum munja or other grasses can reduce erosion and sediment movement to the reservoirs and retain sediments in terraces where they can increase the yields of other crops.

3.Develop low cost means for propagating the most desirable varieties and arranging them in the configurations which will be most effective in accomplishing the first objective, while increasing the productivity and carbon equestration on these watersheds.

4.Determine whether spoil banks from road and canal construction can be stabilized y these plant materials.

One potential option includes the development of stiff grass hedges, planted across the slopes of the watershed.  These hedges may temporarily pond the water coming down the slope, depositing the sediment in the ponded area above each hedge.  This may form “natural” terraces which diffuse, rather than concentrate the flow. This concept has been applied successfully in many tropical countries using vetiver grass hedges. Vetiver grass is not sufficiently cold tolerant to survive in most of the United States, but some other grasses, such as switch grass and Eastern gamma grass have been used with measured success on cropped lands. These grasses are palatable to most grazing animals and consequently it is assumed that they would not be viable as hedges in the rangeland portions of our watersheds. 

Saccharum munja, a grass growing in most parts of Pakistan, when mature, has stems and leaves so stiff and sharply serrated  that livestock will not eat it. Some varieties of this grass grow in the cold regions of the country. Observations of this grass indicate that it has the drought tolerance and other characteristics necessary to form sturdy hedges and perform the needed erosion control on sloping lands. Some varieties of this grass were brought into USDA plant materials centers during the past century, but have not been multiplied, or evaluated in grass hedges for erosion control.
                                                                                                                                         
Sites will be identified, in cooperation with PCRWR counterparts, where grass hedges could achieve the indicated objectives. Owners of suitable land will be contacted and informed of the potential benefits of this technology. If the owner wishes to cooperate in such an activity, PCRWR will draw up a plan and schedule and develop an agreement with the owner for the action to be taken.  The owner will use the land in accordance with the plan. There will be check plots in each field, as fields are often small.  Multiple sites will serve as replications.

Sm and other grasses will also be evaluated in terms of their relative abilities to protect soil, on bunds and ephemeral waterways, against erosion by overflowing water.
If the Sm, and/or other grasses, effectively achieve their objectives in Pakistan they will be evaluated for vegetating and controlling erosion on watersheds in the USA. 

QUALIFICATIONS

The offerors will be more highly rated during evaluation for demonstrating superior technical and research skills.  Possession of a PhD in Soil Physics, and a greater number of years of experience in research in soil and water resource management will be counted towards superior technical and research skills.  

In addition, strong verbal communication skills that enable contractor to communicate with researchers and government officials; strong writing skills, including the development of documents for both technical and non-technical audiences;  International, preferably in a Muslim country are critical and will be considered in evaluation of quotes.

The USDA, Office of International Research Programs are seeking sources for the following:
Technical Assistance for Integrated Water Management Research and  On-farm Irrigation Efficiency in Pakistan


BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES

Pakistan has suffered from many prolonged droughts over the past 45 years.  Rainfall in the region is erratic and scanty.  The rivers continually flow at subsided levels.  The water in Tarbela dam reaches the “dead” level almost every year in February and March, and these are crucial months for irrigation of wheat and cotton crops.  There is a major dependence on subsurface irrigation water to meet shortages.  Barren watersheds are being eroded and these sediments find their way into Pakistani reservoirs and rivers, depriving Pakistan of necessary water storage capacity needed for household and industry consumption and agricultural irrigation.   

Existing and future water resources for irrigation are projected to decline even more. Therefore, improved irrigation and drainage practices become increasingly important to enhance water quality, conserve water, and sustain food production.  Innovative irrigation and drainage management techniques are essential to increase the cost-effectiveness of crop production, improve water quality, reduce soil erosion, reuse waste water, and reduce energy requirements while enhancing and sustaining crop production and water use efficiency. Advanced technologies, such as precision irrigation, site-specific management, remote sensing, and decision support systems, are needed to address the water quantity and quality problems in irrigated agriculture. Sustainable irrigation and drainage systems are needed in arid areas to minimize environmental impacts on agricultural and urban sectors through the development of improved integrated water resource management. 

Under an Interagency Acquisition Agreement (IAA) between the U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs (OES), and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service (ARS), dated 08-17-2004, the ARS is to furnish support of scientific, technological or environmental initiatives in Pakistan which are to be implemented by the ARS and Pakistan.

The purpose of this purchase order is to provide short-term Technical Assistance for Integrated Water Management Research on On-Farm Irrigation Efficiency in Pakistan.  

Tasks

The contractor shall:

1.	Provide technical advice to the Pakistan Council for Research in Water Resources (PCRWR) 	with whom OES and ARS have an established partnership.  Irrigation systems on selected 	sites in Pakistan will be evaluated for efficiencies.  New technologies, such as bed and 	furrow or drip irrigations systems, will be examined and adapted to better suit site specific 	conditions.

2	Study the situation in Pakistan and recommend improved irrigation and drainage 	technologies, management practices, and integrated cropping systems that are 	environmentally sustainable and economically viable.  Special emphasis should be placed on 	methods for managing salts and trace elements in irrigation and drainage waters that would 	reduce their harmful effects on soils, groundwater, and crop productivity.  Drainage practices 	will be developed that enable crops to use shallow groundwater efficiently, while reducing 	the use of agricultural chemicals.  

3.	Evaluate current field research in the application of high efficiency irrigation systems and 	recommend such changes as may be needed in their research to optimize irrigation water 	utilization.

4.		Recommend and develop a study tour of pertinent research and commercial applications for 		the study of U.S. technologies in high efficiency irrigation systems.

5.		Facilitate the selected PCRWR researcher's program for study of current U.S. technologies in 		high efficiency irrigation systems.

Tasks 3, 4 and 5 will be performed which working directly with the PCRWR researchers.

QUALIFICATIONS

The Offerors will be more highly rated during evaluation for demonstrating superior technical and research skills.

<DESC>The Idaho National Laboratory (INL) has developed a method for directly  
imaging acoustic waves on a surface. In particular, the Laser  
Ultrasonic Microscope allows  rapid full field real-time imaging of the  
vibration of  micron sized regions and devices.  The high speed  
visualization results in research and performance optimization in  
manufacturing of consumer micro-devices, which has direct application  
in the telecommunications industry, medical industry, surveillance  
industry, and wherever the evaluation of vibration patterns are needed.  
  
Several prototypes have been developed capable of imaging vibrations,  
in the Hz to GHz range, of objects ranging in size from microns to  
meters.  One prototype ultrasonic microscope is proving to be  
invaluable in quality control monitoring and development of MEMS  
devices produced by a fortune 500 company.  For example, the device has  
been used to improve film bulk acoustic resonator (FBAR) technology, by  
clearly showing three dimensional vibration patterns of the devices:

<SUBJECT>A--COMMERCIALIZATION OF PORTABLE X-RAY FLUORESCENCE (XRF) UNITS FOR ANALYSIS OF MATERIALS AT REMOTE SITES
<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) contemplate holding a briefing on Thursday, August 4, 2005 to discuss opportunities to partner with NASA to further develop portable X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) units into a comprehensive system to be used for space exploration applications and commercial applications in the analysis of materials at remote sites such as planetary locations and crime scenes.   The NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) are collaborating to jointly develop technologies for use in in-situ elemental analysis of materials at forensic sites and use on planetary missions for soil and rock analysis.  A portable XRF system has been developed which has the capability to perform analysis of selected materials to the parts per million levels for a large number of critical elements of interest in forensic and space exploration applications.  The technology will be used for the non-destructive analysis of forensic materials and will be designed to be carried with investigators who may not have scientific and engineering training. Interested parties may have an opportunity to license the Portable XRF Units under these applications.  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.   The Technology Briefing will be held in Baltimore, Maryland.  Registration and details are provided at   http://techtransfer.gsfc.nasa.gov/xrf  .  Briefing participants will receive information regarding the technical capabilities of the units under development and have an opportunity to discuss the technology with technical experts regarding the implementation of this technology to meet dual use requirements.  One-on-one sessions will be conducted immediately following the briefing.   All interested parties must submit their interest in attending the briefing, in writing and must arrive by Thursday, June 30, 2005 to XRF Technology Manager at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Code 504, Greenbelt Road, Greenbelt, MD 20771 or via fax at (301) 286-0301 or register through the website at   http://techtransfer.gsfc.nasa.gov/xrf  .  These submissions of interest must include:  (1) attendee name, (2) company affiliation, (3) company address, (4) company business, (5) place of incorporation, and (6) company capabilities statement related to experience with XRF and remote sensing technologies and integrating these technologies into a comprehensive system.  The company capabilities statement shall be no longer than one-page, 12-point font size, Times New Roman or similar font, with one-inch margins.  Those statements not complying with these requirements shall receive no consideration.  If you have any questions about this opportunity that you would like addressed during the briefing presentations, please forward your questions to the aforementioned individual to arrive by Thursday, June 30, 2005.

POSITION DESCRIPTION
Background

The Asia-Pacific region is defined by OFDA to include 26 countries extending eastward from Pakistan across South, Southeast, and East Asia, in addition to 16 Pacific Island nations, Australia, and New Zealand. The region is a collection of contrasts with rich and poor nations, politically stable and failing states, and diverse cultures, languages, topographies, and disaster vulnerabilities. A large portion of population affected, economic losses, and deaths due to disasters worldwide occur in Asia.

Major disaster-related trends in Asia include an upsurge in conflict and acts of terrorism; voluntary and involuntary migration; urbanization and habitation of marginal lands; water scarcity; technological hazards due to uncontrolled industrialization; and large investments in infrastructure which sometimes result in huge losses from a single disaster event.  

Introduction

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA). OFDA is organized into three divisions, under the management of the Office of the Director. The Disaster Response and Mitigation (DRM) Division is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations. DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response. The Program Support (PS) Division provides programmatic and administrative support including budget-financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA’s Washington and field offices. The Operations (OPS) Division develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue (SAR) Teams, Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

The Regional Advisor will report to the Senior Regional Advisor for the Asia – Pacific Region and work in collaboration with the OFDA-Washington Asia Regional Team.  The Regional Advisor is based in Bangkok, Thailand.  

OBJECTIVE

The Regional Advisor is necessary to OFDA for strategic analysis, coordination of disaster response activities, monitoring and reporting on OFDA-funded activities, and for the identification and formulation of disaster preparedness, mitigation and training programs primarily in East-Southeast Asia. 

STATEMENT OF WORK:

Based in Bangkok, the Regional Advisor focuses on East and Southeast Asia and works under the supervision of, and reports directly to, the Senior Regional Advisor for the Asia-Pacific Region, DCHA-OFDA, in Bangkok. The contractor is responsible for strategic analysis, coordination of disaster response activities, and for the identification and formulation of disaster preparedness, mitigation and training programs primarily in East-Southeast Asia.

This position requires an experienced practitioner in disaster response and preparedness activities who is able to travel outside of Bangkok on short notice for up to 2-3 weeks at a time. The contractor will actively develop and coordinate preparedness, mitigation and training programs to increase the capability of host governments, international organizations, and non governmental organizations to respond and prepare for disasters in the affected region. Focusing on East-Southeast Asia, the DCHA-OFDA Regional Advisor is responsible for the following:
1) Disaster Response - Working directly under the guidance and supervision of the Senior Regional Advisor in Bangkok, the contractor will:
- Travel to the scene of a disaster or potential disaster and 
  conduct initial assessments of damages and needs;
- Recommend appropriate relief assistance and emergency 
  interventions;

- Coordinate the requests, receipt, distribution, tracking, and 
  accounting of relief supplies provided by OFDA;

  time;
- While on travel, maintain communications with the Asia-Pacific 
  Regional Office in Bangkok;
- Under the guidance and supervision of the Senior Regional 
  Advisor, coordinate with OFDA-Washington and prepare 
  information requirements and reports.

2) Disaster Preparedness and Mitigation - OFDA encourages disaster prevention, mitigation, and preparedness activities as a strategy to reduce disaster impacts in areas at risk. Working closely with OFDA-Washington and drawing on the skills and technical expertise within the office and available through inter-and intra-agency agreements, the contractor will assist representatives of host government organizations, international organizations, and non governmental organizations in the development of strong emergency and disaster preparedness-mitigation programs.

Specifically:
- Prepare regular strategic and analytical reports on current or  
  anticipated emergencies, as well as comprehensive preparedness 
  documentation on assigned countries;
- Assist with the design, development, and implementation of 
  strategies and integrated disaster assistance for OFDA, USAID,

  including the review of sector disaster response and plans;
- Provide support as required for other OFDA initiatives in the 
  assigned region as identified by the Asia-Pacific Regional 
  Office. Support may include assessment visits, project design- 
  evaluation exercises and hazards-vulnerability-risk analysis;
- In the area of mitigation, work with other agencies-
  organizations to identify critical disaster concerns affecting 
  the region and countries and develop projects-activities for 
  addressing these;
- Work with local and regional institutions and private-public 
  sector organizations to incorporate mitigation into appropriate 
  programs;
- Other tasks in support of OFDA disaster assistance programs in 
  the region, as assigned by the Senior Regional Advisor.

Q5.  Is the proposal due in May 26, 2005?
A5 – Yes, the time for receipt of proposal has been changed to 2:00p.m. DST (Daylight Savings Time),

A6. – See Section (ix) of the solicitation.  

Q7.  Is this a new solicitation? If not, could you please provide the name of the incumbent firm?

Q8.  Understanding the IBB will conduct Section III of the training outline described. Will the sections be administered in order I,II,III,IV,V etc. or will IBB determine during the daily training schedule when they will want to teach section III?  We are trying to determine if the instructor will be teaching, taking a breath (while IBB teaches) then continues to instruct after their completion.
A8 – The training does not have to be administered in the order presented; the information was presented as a guideline to what we want taught. IBB can negotiate with the resultant awardee on the most appropriate day to present Section III.

Q9.  I would appreciate it if you would consider setting the above solicitation aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business.
A9 – This solicitation requirement has been set-aside for SDVOSBs.

A10 –  Please note that you may bid only if you qualify as a SDVOSB.

A12. No

Q13. Will you be provide us with office support and pay directly all reporting expenses in the duplication binding etc of all manuals; diplomas/ certificates?

Q14. Will you pay for travel expenses to get to the city of presentation? 
A14 – No.

Q15.  Please confirm that the cost of meeting rooms, refreshments; will be paid directly by you, the client.

Q20.  Does the $450 a day maximum payment per training facilitator apply to this request or is that open?  As we are putting together our budget for our response I want to clarify any financial limitations or restrictions to this RFP.
  A20 – The requesting office has not specified such a restriction.

Q21.  Our firm is a Service-Disabled Veteran Small Business and eligible for set-aside contracts.  Please consider using this training project as a SDVOSB.
  A.21 – See A9 for answer.

Q25.  Will IBB handle course announcements, registration, and participant tracking?
A25 - Yes

Q26.  Regarding the project performance schedule, the Scope of Work, Section (c) requires a draft copy of the training materials be submitted to IBB within three weeks of contract award; however, the Deliverables section of the solicitation requires a development plan of learning sessions be submitted thirty days after contract award.

A30 – N/A

Q31.  I understand that the training services will be held in a location within a 50 mile radius of Washington, DC.  Will overnight accommodations be provided?
A31 – No. The attendees will commute to the off-site location.  It is more likely to be with in 15 miles, because participants will come from all over the Washington commuting area and it needs to be a reasonable commute for everyone.

Q32 - Will evening activities be anticipated during the multi-day training sessions?
  A32 – No. 

Q33:  I noticed that this RFP can be submitted via fax or e-mail.  Is courier an acceptable method of delivery as well?

Q34.  I know that each class should be 15-20 students, and I’m trying to determine how many classes would need to be offered this year?  Would all 300 employees need to be trained this year? Or are you only seeking 2-4 total classes this year?  I’m trying to determine the number of instructors required.
A34 – We anticipate only one class this fiscal year (Base Period). 300 employees will not be trained this year. Each class will be offered 2-4 times per year beginning fiscal year 2006 (Option Year 1) until all 300 are trained.

Q35.Are there specific proposal components you would like to see included?  Preferred proposal outline or structure?
A35 – See Section (ix) in the solicitation.
 
Q36.  Is there an incumbent provided predetermined?
A36 – No.
Q37.  When I read the Solicitation, I didn't see any form attachments for use in making a bid.  Are there any, or do I work up a proposal in my own format with quotes for the CLIN information shown on page 2.
A37 – The Offeror must work up a proposal in your own format with quotes for the CLIN information shown in A40 below.  However, as required in the RFP, Offerors proposals must be submitted on an SF-1449 signed by an official authorized to bind your organization.    

Q38.  Are travel costs, lodging, printing/copying and notebook costs and other typical "out of pocket costs" are reimbursed separately or should be included in the overall costs.
A38 – Offerors proposed firm-fixed price per course must be inclusive of all costs associated with providing training services for this requirement.

Q39. Can you give me some guidance on what FAR 51.212-3 (mentioned on page 4) is and where to find it on the web, and also SF-1449.
A39 – The required documents can be accessed by clicking on the following web links:
SF-1449 – http://www.gsa.gov/Portal/gsa/ep/formslibrary.do?formType=SF
FAR Clause 52.212-3—  http://www.arnet.gov/far/ha_far.html

Q40.  The CLIN "B.3.2" is repeated for Option Years 2-4.  Is the numbering correct?  Is the amount derived for Option Year 2 to be used for Option Years 3 and 4?
A40 – The numbering of the CLINs, beginning with Option Year 2, is incorrect.  The CLINS should be numbered as follows: 
CLIN B.1- Base Period (Date of contract award through September 30, 2005):
CLIN B.1.1 - Planning and development of Supervisory Training course (1 Job);
CLIN B.1.2 - Conduct a 3-5 day Supervisory Training course (15-20 students) (1 course);
CLIN B.2-Option Year 1 (October 1, 2005 through September 30, 2006):
CLIN B.2.1 - Conduct a 3-5 day Supervisory Training course (15-20 students) (Cost per course);
CLINB.3 - Option Year 2 (October 1, 2006 through September 30, 2007):
CLIN B.3.1- Conduct a 3-5 day Supervisory Training course (15-20 students) (Cost per course);
CLIN B.4 - Option Year 3 (October 1, 2007 through September 30, 2008)):
CLIN B.4.1- Conduct a 3-5 day Supervisory Training course (15-20 students) (Cost per course);
CLIN B.5 - Option Year 4 (October 1, 2008 through September 30, 2009): 
CLIN B.5.1- Conduct a 3-5 day Supervisory training course (15-20 students) (Cost per course);  

Q41.  Should the Option Year amounts (B.2, B.3, B.4, B.5) be for 2, 3, or 4 classes? 
A41 – Offeror’s price proposals should reflect a firm-fixed price “per course.”  With the exception of the Base Period, BBG guarantees a minimum of two (2) courses to be conducted per Option Year. 

Q42.  Are offerors responsible for merely distributing paper certificates to participants or are CEUs or other specialized certificates/credits expected?
A42 – Contractor is responsible for providing and distributing paper certificates.

Q43.  How soon is an award expected? 
A43 – The end of June.

Q44.  Are we responsible for any costs or materials that the in-house supplied trainer will need for his/her segment of the training?
A44 - No

Q45.  How much time will be required for the section to be taught by the in-house supplied trainer? 
A45 –  4-8 hours.

Q46.  For better preparation for the "Labor & Employee Relations" section, are the supervisors to be trained in a union environment?
A46 – Most supervisors will have bargaining union employees.

Q47.  In "Course Scheduling Changes," it states whether or not there will be reimbursement for scheduling changes at more than 14 days, less than 14 days, but not what will happen if it is equal to 14 days.  Could you clarify?
A47 – The solicitation has been revised to indicate that IBB will not pay any expenses if the AR/CO notifies Contractor fourteen or more calendars days prior to the scheduled training date.

Q48.  Are we guaranteed to have 2 classes requested?  The solicitation states that the "Contractor shall conduct the initial presentation of the requested training not later than Sept 2005."  The deliverables schedule implies that the first class couldn't be any sooner than 5 weeks from award.  Since proposals are due on May 26, award a month later(?), then 5 weeks for creating classes...earliest class seems to be the beginning of August.  Since the end of the contract is Sept 30, 2005, what is the likelihood of us doing 2-4 classes in that timeframe of 2 months?
A48 – CLIN B.1.2, as shown in the RFP, requests pricing for “1 course” to be conducted during the Base Period that ends Sept 30, 2005.  

Q49. Will the supervisors to be instructed be familiar with each other or are they coming from different locations? 
A49 – There may be cases where some supervisors may not know each other but, in all cases, supervisors will primarily come from our main headquarters location, in Washington, DC.

Q50.  Will the supervisors to be instructed be from the Washington, D.C. area or will some or most come from outside of the area?
A50 – See A49 for answer.

Q51.  Page 2 of the solicitation states that the contractor will provide a draft copy of the training material to IBB within three weeks of contract award. Yet, page 4 of the solicitation states that the contractor shall submit a development plan of learning sessions 30 calendar days after contract award. This appears to be conflicting information, especially since the more intensive requirement - the actual materials - is due before the more general requirement - the development plan. Please clarify.
A51 –  See A26 for answer.

Q52. The solicitation calls for the contractor to furnish material for review. How many copies of the material will be required? 
A52 – Two.

Q53.  There appears to be a conflict in the timeline for submission of the draft of material. The Scope of Work states the draft needs to be submitted within 3 weeks of the contract award. The Deliverables calls for a Development of Learning Plan in 30 days. Are these two items the same thing, or is the Plan a design plan with draft material to be developed from the plan. Also which is the correct time constraint. 
A53 -  See A26 for answer.

Q54. What is the anticipated availability by subject matter experts for needs analysis interviews to flush out important items such as current performance gaps in supervisory performance, learning objectives, participant needs, expected outcomes of training, current cultural climate of organization, etc. 
A54 –  IBB’s Training Division will work with the selected contractor to get reasonable access to SME.

Q55. How firm are the deadlines for course development and delivery. Are these subject to change based on design needs? 
A55 – 30 days is firm.

Q56. When is the anticipated contract award date? 
A56 – The end of June.


Q57. Will there be a request for course revisions to handle upgrades to the material after year one?
