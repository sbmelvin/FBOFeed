<DESC><strong>SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE</strong>
<p><strong>Notice Number</strong>: HHS-NIH-NCI-SBSS-TSB-57005-94</p>
<p><strong>Title</strong>: "Registration, Storage and Distribution of Chemicals and Drugs for Pre-Clinical Discovery Evaluation and Development."</p>
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>This National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health (NIH) project is for the renewal of contract HHSN261201300013C with Fisher BioServices, Inc that was awarded on a competitive basis for a two and a half year period.  Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests regarding the current contract should be directed to Suzy Milliard at milliars@mail.nih.gov.  This Small Business Sources Sought Notice (SBSS) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the National Cancer Institute (NCI).</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement as a set-aside based upon responses to this Notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Interested parties are expected to review this Notice and the draft Statement of Work to familiarize themselves with the requirements of this project; failure to do so will be at your firm's own risk.</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>The Drug Synthesis and Chemistry Branch (DSCB) of the Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP) of the Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) is seeking support services to operate and maintain the National Cancer Institute's Chemotherapeutic Agents Repository (NCI-CAR).  The principal goal of this contract is 1) to support compound acquisition activities related to the DTP anticancer pre-clinical drug evaluation program which seeks to identify new small molecule therapeutic agents and 2) distribution of chemicals to intramural and extramural investigators for research purposes.  The primary tasks of the contract are the receipt, registration, storage, analysis, arraying and distribution of small molecules and purified natural products.  In addition, a lesser number of compounds from other NIH (e.g. NIAID, NExT, NCATS) programs may be handled through this contract.</p>
<p>This contract is also responsible for providing an informational interface with NCI and external investigators that are submitting or requesting research compounds; for updating of the chemical database which includes chemical, inventory, receiving and shipping information; systematic file and record keeping of both current and archival information related to Repository activities; and reacquisition of samples for continued chemical and biological studies. <br /> <br />The program is highly flexible and the Contractor shall have the flexibility to respond to changing Program priorities.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose and Objectives:</strong></p>
<p>Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish all the necessary services, qualified personnel, material, equipment and facilities, not otherwise provided by the Government, as needed to perform the Statement of Work below.<br /><br /><strong>Project Requirements:</strong></p>
<p>Specific Tasks</p>
<p>1.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Acquisition/Documentation</span></p>
<p>a. Execute registration policies and procedures developed by DTP for the submission of structures, associated chemical data and compound samples using the DTP website: http://dtp.nci.nih.gov/.  These procedures may be revised and updated over time.  This includes the assignment of NSC registration numbers to chemical structures and other entities (e.g. biologics, creams, investigational, ethical and OTC drug products) using policies and procedures developed by DSCB.</p>
<p>b. Maintain and execute procedures for the non web-based manual submission and registration of structures, associated chemical data and the compounds.</p>
<p>c. Act as primary point-of-contact for submitters of compounds requesting NCI60 evaluation.  It is estimated that 6,000-8,000 requests for individual compounds will be received annually.</p>
<p>d. Assist investigators on structure and sample submission, and website registration procedures.  The procedures and policies are described at the DSCB website:  http://dtp.cancer.gov/docs/misc/common_files/submit_compounds.html.</p>
<p>e. Input chemical structures and chemical data into the NCI chemical database.  The majority of structures (6,000-8,000 annually) are submitted by investigators requesting anti-cancer testing.  It is anticipated that this number along with related labor costs will decrease 5-10% per year.</p>
<p>f. Check the chemical accuracy of structures and chemical data entered into the database.  This includes checking an additional ~5,000 designated archival structures annually for accuracy.</p>
<p>g. Maintain permanent files of all supplier correspondence related to submission of structures, chemical data and physical compound samples.  This includes a file of legal confidentiality agreements between NCI and investigators.</p>
<p>h. Reacquire compounds from submitters as requested by the COR. Generally, this material will be used for additional in vitro/in vivo evaluation.</p>
<p>i. Acquire, through purchase order process, additional quantities of commercial compounds as requested by the COR.</p>
<p>j. Distribute copies of requested archival documentation to NCI staff and external investigators as directed by the COR.  These may be as hard copies or in electronic form.</p>
<p>k. Maintain relevant, accurate, and current records such as identity, inventory and shipping history, for all registered compounds.</p>
<p>2.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Receipt and Storage</span></p>
<p>a. Store chemicals, purified natural products and bulk compounds.  This includes approximately 500,000-600,000 individual samples in current long-term storage.  The majority of compounds are in amounts ranging from 5 mg to 20 g, with a few samples of bulk drug up to 50 kg.  It is estimated that ~90% of samples are stored at controlled ambient conditions.</p>
<p>b. Receive weekday chemical sample shipments and related documentation and, safely store until registered and moved to permanent storage or shipped to researchers.</p>
<p>c. Store chemicals, drugs and plated sets under their recommended storage conditions.  This includes capabilities for temperature storage at controlled, ventilated ambient (5,000 ft2), 0-5 deg C (5,000 ft3), -15 to -20 deg C (10,000 ft3), and -70 to -80 deg C (500 ft3).  In addition, the capability to store a limited number of samples under nitrogen or argon atmosphere; protected from light; under controlled humidity conditions.</p>
<p>d. Provide sufficient monitoring of storage conditions to guarantee continuous proper storage including, for a limited number of bulk API samples, adequate monitoring and documentation to meet cGMP guidelines.   Back-up systems and plans should be available to maintain proper storage conditions in the event of loss of power or other emergency for a period of 5 days.</p>
<p>e. Notify COR immediately when physical changes in chemical samples are noticed.<br />f. Provide safe storage and security measures to conform to all pertinent drug/chemical regulations.  This includes an adequate waterless fire suppression system to protect staff, the chemical inventory and storage infrastructure.</p>
<p>g. Prepare generic Material Safety Data Sheets for specific compounds as directed by COR.</p>
<p>h. Maintain the current computerized inventory of compounds of interest and bulk drugs in the repository.  In addition, infrequently requested drugs shall be inventoried for accuracy at the time an order request is filled.</p>
<p>i. Provide for the safe and proper disposal of items to be eliminated from the inventory stock as the result of decomposition or for other reason at the request of the COR.  No samples should be disposed without authorization of the COR.</p>
<p>j. Receive returned chemicals and drugs and return to inventory or dispose.</p>
<p>k. All work shall be performed utilizing good laboratory techniques in accordance with accepted industry standards.</p>
<p>3.	<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Shipping and Distribution </span></p>
<p>a. Weigh, package and ship chemicals and drugs as approved by the COR to NCI screening laboratories and external research investigators.  These may be located domestically or internationally (e.g. Europe, Asia, Australia).   Shipping costs will be covered by the requester.  It is expected 25,000-30,000 samples will be weighed annually.</p>
<p>b. Provide special handling and packaging for heat and/or light sensitive and labile chemicals and drugs.  The shipments shall conform to all laws and regulations, both domestic and international, governing the shipping of hazardous substances and other regulated substances.</p>
<p>c. Furnish shipping cartons, cushioning materials, labels, containers, insulating material, dry ice and any other supplies to insure the safe, intact arrival of the contents of each package shipped. It is expected that there will be 400 shipments to NCI in Frederick, MD annually.  The contractor will be responsible for both shipping costs and packaging costs.  In addition, it is expected that there will be 700 ambient shipments and 500 dry-ice shipments to extramural investigators, annually.  The contractor will only be responsible for packaging costs to extramural investigators.</p>
<p>d. Update inventory transactions, document the shipment of compounds, and associated data to the NCI chemical database.</p>
<p>e. Provide for regular (3-4/week) overnight shipments of samples to the NCI testing and screening laboratories in Frederick, MD.  Include provisions for 1-day turnaround for a limited number of expedited shipments.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Clinical Center (CC), in the Office of Purchasing and Contracts (OPC) has a need to continue existing genetic analysis laboratory services related to congential adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, where patients are being seen under the Natural History Study of Patients with Excess Androgens, Protocol number: 06-CH-0011 which is currently being provided by Prevention Genetics, LLC in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b). A major goal of this study is to evaluate genetic causes associated with certain clinical conditions. NIH/CC needs to provide results to patients, thus NIH/CC needs to use a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certified lab. This requires sending blood to a CLIA certified commercial laboratory. Prevention Genetics is a CLIA-certified laboratory that is currently offering and has offered genetic analysis and genetic sequencing of a gene of interest to the NIH/CC study: the tenascin-X gene which lies next to the CAH gene.
<p>NIH/CC are interested in screening some patients for a contiguous gene deletion that involves both the CAH gene and the tenascin-X gene. This is referred to as a chimera deletion. Prevention Genetics offers screening for this genetic mutation. Therefore, the need to assure continuity of protocol content and data control, the NIH/CC/OPC intends to sole source the requirement for the required laboratory services.</p>
<p>The purpose of the work is to identify mutations that affect the tenascin-X gene for up to 100 samples on an annual basis. Government responsibilities, NIH/CC will be responsible for obtaining blood specimens from patients under an Internal Review Board (IRB) approved protocol and will be responsible for interpreting clinical implications of results. Reporting requirements of the laboratory shall provide a written report of the genetic analysis performed. Program management and control requirements for the laboratory shall be CLIA certified. Blood and/or DNA will be shipped from NIH/CC to Prevention Genetics according to the NIH/CC regulations and via courier- per company standards.</p>
<p>It is NIH/CC/OPC's intent to sole source the requirement to:</p>

The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension.<br /><br />(b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause.<br /><br />(c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed 3 years.<br /><br />(End of clause)<br /><br />The following DFARS Clauses apply to this procurement:<br />252.201-7000, Contracting Officer's Representative (Dec 1991);<br />252.203-7000, Requirements Relating to Compensation of Former DoD Officials (Sep 2011);<br />252.203-7003, Agency Office of the Inspector General (Apr 2012);<br />252.232-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports (Mar 2008);<br />252.232-7006, Wide Area WorkFlow Payment Instructions (May 2013) (full text version wil be included in any subsequent award);<br />252.243-7002, Requests for Equitable Adjustment (Dec 2012).<br /><br />The following DLAD Clauses apply to this procurement:<br />52.204-9000, Contractor Personnel Security Requirements (Apr 2014).<br />52.215-9023, Reverse Auction (Oct 2013)<br /><br />The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line reverse auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. If the Contracting Officer does not conduct a reverse auction, award may be made on the basis of initial offers or following discussions not using reverse auctioning as a pricing technique. If the Contracting Officer decides to use on-line reverse auctioning to conduct price negotiations, the Contracting Officer will notify Offerors of this decision and the following provisions will apply:<br /><br />(a) The award decision will be made in accordance with the evaluation factors as set forth in the solicitation. The reverse on-line auction will be used as a pricing technique during discussions to establish the final offered prices from each Offeror. These prices will be used in conjunction with the evaluation factors stated elsewhere in the solicitation in order to make the award decision in accordance with the basis for award stated in the solicitation.<br /><br />(b) Following the decision to conduct discussions using reverse auctioning as a pricing technique, the Contracting Officer or his/her representative will provide Offerors determined to be in the competitive range with information concerning the auction process.<br /><br />(c) Prior to conducting the reverse auction, the Contracting Officer may hold discussions with the Offerors concerning matters appropriate for discussion, such as issues involving technical proposals or unbalanced pricing.<br /><br />(d) Unless auction instructions indicate that only Offeror's rankings will be displayed, the lowest Offeror's price(s) for each round of the reverse auction will be disclosed to other Offerors and anyone else having authorized access to the auction. This disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each Offeror's identity will be concealed from other Offerors (although it will be known to the Government; only a generic identifier will be used for each Offeror's proposed pricing, such as "Offeror A" or "lowest-priced Offeror").&nbsp; By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, Offerors agree to participate in the reverse auction and that their prices may be disclosed, including to other Offerors, during the reverse auction.</span>
<p>e) An Offeror's final auction price at the close of the reverse auction will be considered its final price proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the reverse auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final price proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.307, or the Contracting Officer determines that it would be in the best interest of the Government to re-open the auction.</p>
<p>f) The following requirements apply when the Government uses a commercial web-based product to conduct the reverse auction:</p>
<p>1) Each Offeror identified by the Contracting Officer as a participant in the reverse auction will be contacted by Defense Logistic Agency's commercial reverse auction service provider to advise the Offeror of the event and to provide an explanation of the process.</p>
<p>2) In order for an Offeror to participate in the reverse auction, such Offeror must agree with terms and conditions of the entire solicitation, including this provision, and agree to the commercial reverse auction service provider's terms and conditions for using its service. Information concerning the reverse auction process and the commercial service provider's terms and conditions is embedded within the email notification sent by the on-line reverse auction pricing tool system administrator.</p>
<p>3) Offerors shall secure the passwords and other confidential materials provided by the commercial reverse auction service provider or the Government and ensure they are used only for purposes of participation in the reverse auction. Offerors shall keep their own and other Offeror's pricing in confidence until after contract award.</p>
<p>4) The reverse auction system currently in use designates offers as "Lead,"meaning the current low price in that auction, or "Not Lead," meaning not the current low price in that auction. In the event of a tie offer, the reverse auction provider's system designates the first offer of that price as "Lead" and the second or subsequent offer of that price as "Not Lead." Offerors shall not submit a tie offer, since this is inconsistent with the purpose of the reverse auction. If a tie offer is submitted and no evaluation factors other than price were identified in the solicitation, the "Not Lead" Offeror that submitted the tie offer must offer a changed price; otherwise its offer will be ineligible for award if their final price in the auction is the tie offer price. If evaluation factors in addition to price were listed in the solicitation, tie offers that are "Not Lead" will be considered and evaluated in accordance with those evaluation factors.</p>
<p>5) Any Offerors unable to enter pricing through the commercial reverse auction service provider's system during a reverse auction must notify the Contracting Officer or designated representative immediately. The Contracting Officer may, at his/her sole discretion, extend or re-open the reverse auction if the reason for the Offeror's inability to enter pricing is determined to be without fault on the part of the Offeror and outside the Offeror's control.</p>
<span>(6) The reverse auction will be conducted using the commercial reverse auction service provider's website as embedded in the email notification. Offerors shall be responsible for providing their own computer and internet connection.<br /><br />(7) Training:<br /><br />(i) The commercial reverse auction service provider and/or a Government representative will provide familiarization training to Offerors' employees; this training may be provided through written material, the commercial reverse auction service provider's website, and/or other means.<br /><br />(ii) An employee of an Offeror who successfully completes the training shall be designated as a "Trained Offeror." Only Trained Offerors may participate in a reverse auction. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to request that Offerors provide an alternate Offeror employee to become a Trained Offeror. The Contracting Officer also reserves the right to take away the Trained Offeror's designation from any Trained Offeror who fails to abide by the solicitation's or commercial reverse auction service provider's terms and conditions.<br /><br />(End of provision)<br /><br /><br /><strong>INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS: </strong><br />Submit quotes by email (preferred) to Nicholas.Moore@dla.mil no later than the date and time detailed in this solicitation.&nbsp; Attention should be noted to FAR 52.212-1(f) concerning late submissions.&nbsp; The offeror bears the risk of non-reciept of any email transmissions, and should ensure that all pages of the quote have been received by the designated office before the deadline indicated.<br /><br />Quotes may also be mailed to: <br />DLA Disposition Services<br />Attn: Nicholas Moore (J7)<br />74 N. Washington Ave.<br />Battle Creek, MI 49037<br /><br />Quotes may be submitted for one or more bid schedules, to include the option periods.&nbsp; Each bid schedule is for a region as illustrated on the map attachment.&nbsp; The offeror does not need to quote on all bid schedules, but shall price all CLINs within each bid schedule to be considered for award.<br /><br />Offerors shall provide the applicable CAGE code and DUNS number with their quote submission.&nbsp; Quote shall include company name, main point of contact, phone number, and email.<br /><br /><br /><strong>QUOTE EVALUATION:</strong><br />Pricing and past performance for each schedule will be evaluated independently and may result in the award of individual schedules to offerors who have provided a quote; however, no individual schedule will be awarded to more than one offeror.&nbsp; Award of each bid schedule will be made to the responsible offeror whose quote provides the best value to the Government in terms of past performance and price.&nbsp; In the award evaluation for each bid schedule, past performance is significantly more important than price in determining the offeror that provides the best value to the Government.</span>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Past Performance:</span></p>
<p>(1)   The Government will conduct a Performance Confidence Assessment for each offeror based upon submitted current, relevant Past Performance Information (PPI) (consisting of Past Performance (PP) references) as it relates to the probability of the offeror being able to successfully perform the requirement. The Government's subjective evaluation of the overall quality of an offeror's submitted PPI will be a factor in determining the relative merits of the offeror's proposal, and in selecting for award the offeror whose proposal is considered the best value to the Government based upon the importance of the factors identified above.  Offerors will be given an opportunity to address especially unfavorable reports of past performance, and the offeror's response, or lack thereof, will be taken into consideration.</p>
<p>(2) In investigating an offeror's past performance, the Government may consider information in the offeror's proposal and information obtained from other sources, including past and present customers and their employees, other government agencies, including state and local agencies, consumer protection organizations and better business bureaus; former subcontractors; and others who may have useful information. Failure by the offeror to provide evidence of relevant performance on contracts of the same or similar nature in terms of performance timeframes, dollar values and complexities of services provided will be considered by the Government to have no relevant past performance and an unknown confidence (neutral) rating. The offeror is responsible for ensuring references submit past performance surveys; the Government will not be contacting references to obtain a survey on behalf of the offeror. The Government will evaluate past performance and experience in accordance with submission requirements contained herein.</p>
<p>(3)  An offeror that has no identifiable record of performance of a same or similar nature to the current requirement may be considered by the Government to have no relevant past performance. In the case of an offeror without an identifiable record of past performance or for whom information on past performance is unavailable (this includes PPI identified by an offeror for the offeror firm, for which the required, corresponding PPI Collection Documents were not received by the Government), the offeror may not be assessed either favorably or unfavorably on Performance Confidence, as the degree of confidence to the Government cannot be adequately determined and is therefore unknown.</p>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span>
<p>PAST PERFORMANCE SUBMISSION</p>
<p>A) The offeror is required to provide past performance data for the firm under either Government or commercial contracts for the same or similar services within the last 3 years.  The offeror shall provide no more than 5 past performance references.  The offeror is required to provide in their proposal evidence for each reference that describes the relevancy of the work required compared to the solicitation in terms of performance timeframes, dollar values and complexities of the services provided.  The description of work performed shall be in sufficient detail to explain how each reference relates to same or similar requirements of the instant solicitation in areas such as performance timeframes, and complexities of services to determine the relevancy of the work).</p>
<p>B) For each reference provided, a valid name and telephone number, contract number, contract type, dollar value, contract award and completion dates, point of contact, description of worked performed, and e-mail address of point of contact is required.</p>
<p>C) If the offeror elects to provide principal subcontractor past performance, the offeror shall provide the principal subcontractors' consent allowing the Government to disclose negative past performance information to the offeror.</p>
<p>D) The past performance data sheet attached contains a past performance survey that is used to evaluate an offeror's past performance. The offeror shall provide the past performance survey to the past performance reference they identify in this part of the proposal. The past performance reference shall independently submit the survey to the Contracting Officer prior to the closing date of the solicitation. Any completed past performance survey received after the date of closing or directly from the offeror will not be considered in the past performance evaluation.</p>
<p>E) The submission of a past performance volume is required; otherwise an offeror may be determined non-responsive and ineligible for award.  If an offeror does not have any past performance references, offerors must at least identify a Volume II in their quote and state they do not have any past performance to provide.  If the Government only receives a past performance survey from a past performance reference and there is no information in an offeror's proposal regarding that reference (see paragraph above), the reference will not be considered. The offeror is responsible for ensuring references submit past performance surveys; the Government will not be contacting references for the purpose of obtaining past performance surveys.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Price:</span>&nbsp; The Government will evaluate the entire price (inclusive of options).</p>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes-</p>
<p>(1) Data collected from prospective Federal awardees required for the conduct of business with the Government;</p>
<p>(2) Prospective contractor-submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR subpart 4.12; and</p>
<p>(3) Identification of those parties excluded from receiving Federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>

<p>(1) A code assigned by the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) to identify a commercial or Government entity; or</p>
<p>(2) A code assigned by a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that DLIS records and maintains in the CAGE master file. This type of code is known as an "NCAGE code."</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code into the SAM database; and</p>
<p>(2) The contractor has completed the Core Data, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>
<p><br />252.225-7048 Export Controlled Items (Jun 2013)</p>
<p>(a) Definition. "Export-controlled items," as used in this clause, means items subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) (15 CFR Parts 730-774) or the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) (22 CFR Parts 120-130). The term includes:</p>

<p>(2) "Items," defined in the EAR as "commodities", "software", and "technology," terms that are also defined in the EAR, 15 CFR 772.1.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items, including, but not limited to, the requirement for contractors to register with the Department of State in accordance with the ITAR. The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>
<p>(2) The Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2751, et seq.);</p>

<p>(5) The International Traffic in Arms Regulations (22 CFR Parts 120-130); and</p>
<p>(6) Executive Order 13222, as extended.</p>
<p>(e) The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (e), in all subcontracts.</p>
<p>(End of clause)</p>
<p>252.232-7010 Levies on Contract Payments (Dec 2006)</p>
<p>(a) 26 U.S.C. 6331(h) authorizes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to continuously levy up to 100 percent of contract payments, up to the amount of tax debt.</p>
<p>(b) When a levy is imposed on a payment under this contract and the Contractor believes that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Procuring Contracting Officer in writing, with a copy to the Administrative Contracting Officer, and shall provide-</p>
<p>(1) The total dollar amount of the levy;</p>
<p>(2) A statement that the Contractor believes that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract, including rationale and adequate supporting documentation; and</p>
<p>(3) Advice as to whether the inability to perform may adversely affect national security, including rationale and adequate supporting documentation.</p>
<p>(c) DoD shall promptly review the Contractor's assessment, and the Procuring Contracting Officer shall provide a written notification to the Contractor including-</p>
<p>(1) A statement as to whether DoD agrees that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract; and</p>
<p>(2)(i) If the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract and the lack of performance will adversely affect national security, the total amount of the monies collected that should be returned to the Contractor; or</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.

<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6 and part 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number HSCG38-15-Q-200044 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-78 effective 26 December 2014.</p>
<p>The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336411. The small business size standard is 1,500 employees. This is an unrestricted requirement. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price purchase order shall be awarded on a sole source basis to Airbus Helicopters, Incorporated (AHI) as a result of this synopsis/solicitation. All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), Airbus Helicopter France (Cage Code F0210) and AHI (3GSZ1). Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.</p>
<p>It is the Government's belief that AHI is the only known source to provide traceability, and genuine OEM parts, required to successfully provide these items. Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation. No alternate part numbers will be accepted.</p>
<p>SEE ATTACHED SPREADSHEET "HSCG38-15-Q-2000044 - REQUIREMENTS" FOR A LIST OF REQUIRED PARTS.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested, and a written solicitation document will not be issued.

Resulting orders will be firm-fixed-priced orders. The consignments will be assigned to the William S. Middleton Memorial Veteran Hospital, Madison, WI (607). The ordering period for these agreements will be for 5 years from the effective date. 

Terms of the Basic Ordering Agreement
1. Price at which the item(s) will be sold to the Government during the period of the agreement and ordering period (DATE WILL BE SET AT TIME OF ESTABLISHMENT OF BASIC ORDERING AGREEMENT[BOA] FOR FIVE YEARS)

2. A contract is formed upon vendor acceptance of an order, and reimbursement will be made to the vendor for the item on consignment when use of the item is made by the VA. Unused items are returned to the vendor at the end of the effective period of the agreement without reimbursement or other expense to the Government. 
3. The Government assumes no liability for any item(s) assigned to VHA on a consignment basis until a requirement for the item exists and a purchase or delivery order is placed against the agreement. Title for the consigned items shall remain with the contractor until the items are used.

4. Payment for items furnished under the agreement is applicable only when such items are used (implanted) or the package is opened by the VA. Contractor agrees to accept the Government purchase card as the preferred method of payment.

5. The contractor shall assign a representative to the facility to initiate and oversee the consignment inventory.

6. NCO 12 contracting officers and VISN 12 purchasing agents are authorized to issue orders under this agreement.

7. Failure to reach agreement on price for any order issued before its price is established is a dispute under the Disputes clause included in the basic ordering agreement.

8. All basic ordering agreement shall be reviewed annually before the anniversary of its effective date and revised as necessary to conform to the requirements of this regulation. Basic ordering agreements may need to be revised before the annual review due to mandatory statutory requirements. A basic ordering agreement shall be changed only by modifying the agreement itself and not by individual orders issued under it. Modifying a basic ordering agreement shall not retroactively affect orders previously issued under it.

9. All interested companies shall provide quotations for the requirements listed on this combined synopsis, any mention of a brand name per the below listed requirements are due to the fact that they are known to meet or have met the Government's needs.

The excess unused items will be returned to the contractor at the end of the term of the contract without reimbursement or other expense to the Government.

4. Replacement Products: VHA will withdraw products from the consignment stock on a first-in first-out basis.

<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge.

<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(1) A code assigned by the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) to identify a commercial or Government entity; or</p>

<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern.

This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p>a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code into the SAM database; and</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>

The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.

The XML direct transfer is a format for transferring files from a contractor's systems to the secure web site without the need for separate data entries for each required data element at the web site.  The specific formats for the XML direct transfer may be downloaded from the website.    <br>      <br>   Quality Assurance Plan:   <br>   The Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) will monitor contractor performance and complete the Quality Assurance Worksheet provided below on a monthly basis.  The Quality Assurance Worksheet will be submitted directly to the Administering Contracting Officer with a copy to the Contracting Officer Representative (COR) following the first month of performance following the service. Future months will be submitted to the Contracting Officer only, unless COR involvement is warranted (i.e. anything other than green).  The COR will assume a quality performance rating of  quote mark Green quote mark  on all measured deliverables unless otherwise notified.    <br>   The quality rating may change from  quote mark Green quote mark  to  quote mark Red quote mark  without notice.  We anticipate the COR utilizing the  quote mark Yellow quote mark  quality rating to alert the contracting office and the COR of quality issues that have the potential for a  quote mark Red quote mark  quality rating if corrective action is not taken.   <br>   By approving service and/or deliverables on the worksheet, the COR confirms the quality performance rating of  quote mark Green quote mark  unless otherwise annotated.  The Contracting Officer listed in the contract will provide the Contractor with a copy of all rating worksheets that are other than green.   <br>   At the end of the performance period, the COR will be asked to complete a Quality Performance Review to document the quality performance rating.  This will be submitted to the Contracting Officer. If there are any ratings other than green a copy will be furnished to the contractor.    <br>   The COR may submit a Quality Assurance Worksheet at anytime and as often as necessary to document quality levels.  If Contractor response to an identified quality deficiency is unsatisfactory, the Contracting Officer will contact the appropriate Contractor representative to implement a plan of action to remedy the identified deficiency   <br>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<DESC><p style="text-align: left;"><strong>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS REGARDING <br />DOS HITSS-II ACQUISITION:<br /></strong><br /><br /><br />1.&nbsp; Has the acquisition schedule been updated? In particular, when will the industry conference be held?</p>
<p><strong><em>The acquisition schedule is presently being updated and will be released in the near future. The industry awareness conference is in the planning stage and has not been scheduled yet. The conference will be held before the down-select process is conducted. We intend to conduct the down-select process for both acquisition tracks simultaneously.</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />2.&nbsp; What is the down-selection process to be used for the HITSS-II acquisition?</p>
<p><strong><em>The down-selection process will be conducted using Advisory Multi-Step techniques per FAR 15.202. The objective of the down-select process is to eliminate any nonviable entities who do not qualify for award because they do not meet mandatory qualifications. This step reduces the number of proposals to be evaluated and discourages nonviable firms from spending their funds on high risk proposals, i.e., those having a low probability of award. The qualifications for the Advisory Multi-Step Process are:</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>&bull;Small and/or Small Disadvantaged Business Status Certification<br />&bull;GSA Schedule 70 Contract: current contract-holder<br />&bull;Security Requirements: Top Secret Facility, Secret Personnel<br />&bull;508 Compliance &amp; Corporate Experience In 508 Testing <br />&bull;Adequacy of Corporate Financial Infrastructure.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Our next posting will describe these qualifications in more detail. At this time, you do not need to do anything to participate in this acquisition; simply watch for more FBO postings and just follow the notices and instructions as they are posted.</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Please explain the process for using the 2 acquisition tracks and who is included in each track.</p>
<p><strong><em>The HITSS-II acquisition will involve only GSA Schedule 70 contract-holders, targeting 8(a) companies in acquisition track 1, and SDVOSBs, HUBZone businesses, and EDWOSBs in acquisition track 2. Initially a down-selection will be used to qualify potential offerors for participation in the source selection. Then HITSS-II BPAs will be awarded following formal source selection procedures using evaluation factors (e.g., past performance). After the HITSS-II BPAs are awarded, the individual task orders under the BPAs will be competitively awarded with the objective of a split of 25% of dollar volume awarded to track 1 and 75% to track 2, following the Department's priority list of HUBZone, SDVOSB and EDWOSB. </em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; What does our firm need to do to show interest and to participate in the industry awareness conference and down-selection process?</p>
<p><em><strong>At this time, you do not need to do anything to participate in this acquisition; simply watch for more FBO postings and just follow the notices and instructions as they are posted. DO NOT SUBMIT ANY DOCUMENTS AND/OR QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME.</strong></em></p>

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   Edwards Lifesciences is the only vendor that assists their customers with the training process, on-site support, and hands-on experience that is required when starting this process as new users of transcather heart valves.  Edwards provides on-site and off-site training at no cost to the organization.  All of the physicians that will be implanting these valves have been trained by Edwards Lifesciences.  Edwards has already provided 5 days of on-site training and support for the nursing and technical staff in our Cath Lab.  They will continue to be on-site in order to assist the staff through the first 20 procedures.

Medtronic does not offer any of this on-site training and ongoing on-site support for new users and new clinics.  Medtronic's sales model is to sell their transcatheter heart valves to clinics already experianced in this procedure.  Our new clinic with so many inexperienced staff members, we can only use the Edwards Sapian XT heart valves as Edwards provides superior training and support.

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  A market study was completed , both GSA and open market, there are two maufacturers FDA approved for transcatheter heart valves, Edwards Lifesciences and Medtronic.  An Intent to sole source was published to FBO, with negative responses.


9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  None

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  Edwards Lifesciences.

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  Should another requisition of this nature reoccur, we would undertake a new market survey.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR SINGLE SOURCE AWARDS IAW FAR 13.106-1
(OVER MICRO-PURCHASE THRESHOLD($3K) BUT NOT EXCEEDING THE SAT ($150K))
IAW FAR13.104, COs must promote competition to the maximum extent practicable to obtain supplies and services from the source whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government, considering the administrative cost of the purchase. When competition is not practicable, IAW FAR13.106-1(b), COs solicit from a single source for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.  COs may solicit from one source if the CO determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization). IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3),COs are required to include additional statements explaining the absence of competition (see 13.106-1 for brand name purchases) if only one source is solicited and the acquisition does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (does not apply to an acquisition of utility services available from only one source) or supporting the award decision if other than price-related factors were considered in selecting the supplier.  This template when completed can be used to document single source awards IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3).  Note: Statements such as "only known source" or "only source which can meet the required delivery date" are inadequate to support a sole source purchase.  
1. PURCHASE REQUEST OR REQUISITION NUMBER:

3. UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED:  Airgas, LLC is the incumbent vendor, with a tank and other equipment already installed at the Aleda E. Lutz VA Medical Center, Saginaw, Michigan.  Oxygen is critical in daily patient care at the VA Medical Center.


4.  REASON THAT SUGGESTED SOURCE IS THE ONLY SOURCE, WHICH CAN PROVIDE THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES:  
Airgas, LLC is the incumbent vendor, with an Bulk Oxygen Storage tank and other equipment already installed at the Aleda E. Lutz VA Medical Center, Saginaw, Michigan.  


5.
