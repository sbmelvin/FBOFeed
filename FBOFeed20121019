<DESC>W15QKN-12-R-E013					W15QKN-13-R-E013

QUESTION: Reference - The posting for RFP W15QKN-12-R-E013 indicates that the contract will be for the acquisition of Commercial Services with incidental supplies  The PWS for T0 0001 indicates that satisfactory completion cannot be achieved without designing, testing and delivering an RF Subsystem that meets a detailed set of requirements.  Is the RF Subsystem an incidental supply item or is T0 0001 a fixed price supply task order for a commercial item?
RESPONSE: The contract allows for the delivery of material and hardware. This item is considered hardware.
QUESTION: Is there any Proprietary Data associated with the NGATS RF Microwave Frequency Support?
RESPONSE: There is no proprietary data associated with this task.
QUESTION: Para 4.3.1 of the TASK01 PWS states shall support all current and future requirements
Recommend above wording be changed to the following: shall support all current and known future requirements
RESPONSE:  We would like the system to be robust enough to support future technologies. The contractors should analyze what the industry roadmaps are and plan for growth of their design to support these technologies.
QUESTION: Para 4.3.1.1 of the TASK01 PWS states shall assure all current and future systems are addressed.
Recommend above wording be changed to the following: shall assure all current and known future systems are addressed.
RESPONSE: We would like the system to be robust enough to support future technologies. The contractors should analyze what the industry roadmaps are and plan for growth of their design to support these technologies.
QUESTION: Para 4.23.1 of the TASK01 PWS states All data delivered to the Government shall be unlimited. All markings contrary to this and existing in the TDP shall be removed before delivery.
Recommend above wording be changed to the following: The Government shall have unlimited rights to data that is developed under this contract.
RESPONSE:   Noted. The wording is not changed.
QUESTION:
BASIC PWS Para 4.3.2 states The contractor shall develop test stations that conform to DoD standards for ATS, support open architecture, utilize state of the art technologies, contain no proprietary hardware/software, and utilize commercial off the shelf instruments to the greatest extent possible.
Recommend above wording be changed as follows: The contractor shall develop test stations that conform to DoD standards for ATS, support open architecture, utilize state of the art technologies, contain no proprietary hardware/software to the greatest extent possible, and utilize commercial off the shelf instruments to the greatest extent possible.
RESPONSE:   Proprietary information is not to be submitted. The wording will not be changed.
QUESTION:
TASK 01 PWS Paragraph 4.20.1 states One complete set of technical data suitable for recomplete for the all prototype hardware shall be delivered. The design of the hardware product baseline shall be documented through the use of engineering data. The TDP shall conform to data item description, DI-SESS-8100D (CDRL A008), Product Drawings/Models and Associated Lists.
Recommend that the recomplete level TDP be defined on a task-by-task basis to ensure prototype efforts are timely and affordable.
RESPONSE:   Noted, will be defined with what level of data is required.
QUESTION: There appears to be a discrepancy between the Labor Category and Rates Table in Section L and the Labor Category Descriptions file. The table lists labor category G Software Engineer, while there is no labor category description.
RESPONSE:  The Labor Category Description file will be revised.
QUESTION:
FIRST TASK ORDER
Will we have access to an NGATS system software, in order to integrate the new hardware?
RESPONSE: Yes the software will be made available if required.
QUESTION: This should be covered by a general statement that it needs re-work.
RESPONSE:  The comment is unclear. Unable to provide a response.
QUESTION: For paragraph 4.14.1 (PWSFirstTask.doc):   Requires the contractor to supply an integration log book (CDRL A007) for the RF sub-system [at paragraph 4.14.2].  However, the description for CDRL A007 is for a TPS Integration Log book.  What is the Governments expectation for the content, format, etc of an RF Subsystem integration log book?
RESPONSE:  This is an error and will be corrected. The log book will be in contractor format and specified in the CDRL.
QUESTION: In Section 5.3.1 one of the future ATE Systems listed is ARGCS.  What is the role that ARGCS will play in the US Army Standard Family of Testers?
RESPONSE: The ARGCS was an evaluation/demonstration project. It will not be part of the IFTE family of Testers.
QUESTION: From the time of the Sources Sought, until now at Draft RFP, the EO/IR Hardware Requirements and the IRWindows Software requirements have been dropped.  Is it to be assumed there will be no EO/IR type activities implemented on this IDIQ?
RESPONSE:  The EO requirement has been put back into the basic PWS.
QUESTION: FIRST TASK ORDER
What type of Acceptance test will be required, for the first task? e.g.Will there be TPS's that need to be integrated with the RF subsystem.
RESPONSE: No. Functional testing to verify the subsystem meets the requirements. 10/03/12 IPT: Joe Cuccaro to review and provide a response. The first task will most likely be de-scoped to eliminate the prototype delivery.
QUESTION: It appears that an update is required for the data in the tables of paragraph 4.3.  For instance, frequency measurement inputs normally specify sensitivity (lowest measurable signal) as well as Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR).  Can we expect this appendix to be revised?
RESPONSE: All errors will be corrected in the final version
QUESTION: Why is a commitment letter for the basic PWS required, when no work will be awarded on the base?
RESPONSE: In conjunction with the resumes, letters of commitment from each person identified shall be provided documenting the Offeror's availability to begin performing this effort at the time of award. This is in accordance with Instructions to Offerors - Sections L and Evaluation Factors for Award - M Subfactor 2 (Personnel Knowledge and Experience).  The Government wants to ensure that the offeror has personnel available to support this effort as stated in the Performance Work Statement.

<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.<br />"The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307."</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.
<p><br />The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) on behalf of the National Human Genome Research Institute, (NHGRI), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to OpGen 708 Quince Orchard Road, Suite 160, Gaithersburg, Maryland 20878-1789 to procure the following:</p>
<p>1. Argus Enzyme Kit AfII, Catalog Number: 14216-010, Quantity: Twelve (12) Each.<br />2. Argus Sample Preparation Kit, Catalog Number: 14300-010, Quantity: Four (4) Each.<br />3. Argus QCard Kit, Catalog Number: 14020-006, Quantity: Six (6) Each.<br />5. Argus MapCard Kit II for Large Genome, Catalog Number: 14011-010, Quantity: Two (2) Each.<br />6. Argus MapCard Kit II for Microbial, Catalog Number: 14001-010, Quantity: Ten (10) Each.</p>
<p>This is a Follow-on Requirement. The sole source determination is based on the fact that National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), NIH Intramural Sequencing Center (NISC) is a centralized research facility for performing high-throughput, large-scale DNA sequencing and sequence analysis. NISC is currently using OpGen Optical Mapping System in their laboratory. One of the goals of this project is to provide reference genome sequences for novel microbial isolates. To maintain compatibility for the research studies with no disruption, NISC will need to purchase the Argus reagent kits from OpGen the sole provider. The OpGen Optical Mapping System which is a powerful, unique platform for automated, microbial whole genome analysis. This de novo Optical Mapping Technology generates high-resolution, ordered whole microbial genome maps from single microbial DNA molecules with no requirements for previous sequence information. This machine will mainly be used for the Human Skin Microbiome Project. By using the novel technology called Argus, which is manufactured by OpGen, the researchers have been able to generate genomic restriction maps. This has been such a successful approach that the NIH Clinical Center now works with NISC to track the evolution and migration of outbreaks. NISC needs to purchase validated reagents and materials for use with this instrument in order to meet project demands. To use any other source other than OpGen would be detriment to the research studies.</p>
<p>This is a small business. Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 339113, Surgical and Medical Instrument Manufacturing and the Small Business Size Standard is 500. The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6 B Competitive Requirements are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001) and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-61, (October 15, 2012). This requirement is under the SAT of $150,000.00.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis, by October 25, 2012, 7:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Inquires to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NHLBI-CSB-(HG)-2013-020-DLM, may be submitted to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisition, COAC Services Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6149, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7902, Attention: Dorothy Maxwell. Response may be submitted electronically to maxwelld@mail.nih.gov. Faxes will not be accepted. Responses will only be accepted if dated and signed by an authorized company representative.</p>
<p>Note: In order to receive an award from NIH/NHLBI, contractors must be registered and have a valid CCR and ORCA on-line at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/.</p>

The Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division intends to negotiate award of a follow-on sole source, Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF), Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) single award contract with the Canadian Commercial Corporation (CCC) on behalf of Lockheed Martin Canada (LMC), to provide Visual Interactive Simulated Training Application  (VISTA) simulation services in support of the Center for Surface Combat Systems (CSCS), Dahlgren, VA.
 This requirement will be solicited in accordance with the authority of 10 U.S. C 2304 (c) (1) and FAR Part 6.302-1 (a) (2) (iii), Only One Responsible Source. 

The services to be provided include the modernization, maintenance and upgrade of computer based equipment simulations in support of technician training using simulated technical training equipment. The Synthetic Maintenance Trainers (SMT)s are designed with fault scenarios representative of those experienced on actual equipment. SMTs are visual and aural characterizations of a device, equipment, subsystem or system presented on a personal computer so that the external behaviors or actions/reactions attributes are representative of the behaviors of the actual device/system.
 

Each simulation shall be delivered in accordance with the VISTA Project Management Plan (PMP) as detailed in the Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL). LMC retains the intellectual property rights, data rights, technologies, drawings and other descriptions inherent in VISTA and IN-CONTROL course management systems, which were the basis for development of VISTA specifically for the U.S. Navy under contract N00178-03-D-2030. 

The period of performance is anticipated to be for a total length of three (3) years, including one basic year and two option years. Responsible sources may identify their interest and capability which shall be considered by the agency. This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals.
 A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
This notice is a synopsis and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it is not a commitment by the U.S. Navy to procure the subject services. 

All capabilities shall be in compliance with the performance work statement specifications listed in the solicitation that will follow this announcement. Firms interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact Lockheed Martin Canada directly.
 It is anticipated that the solicitation will be issued on or around 05 November 2012 and will be open for 30 business days. Contract award will be approximately 01 April 2013. Any questions regarding this synopsis should be addressed to Aninze Awanna at aninze.awanna@navy.mil.

<DESC>NSWC Indian Head requires labor, material, and services required to support the Gun Weapon System Repair Program (GWSRP) in removal, installation, refurbishment, Fleet Technical Assistance and Maintenance, and Modernization of various Gun Weapon System (GWS) Equipment, and Ancillary/Support Equipment under the cognizance of the GWSRP Program.  Thus, the expected contract vehicle referenced under this synopsis shall be an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract that will extend no longer than three years (36 months), if all options are exercised, from contract award.   It will consist of one base year plus two option years.  Task and delivery orders will be placed as both cost-plus-fixed-fee and firm-fixed-price, as appropriate.
  This requirement is considered full and open.  The NAICS code is 811219.  The Size Standard is $19M.  The FSC code is J010.  This synopsis is for non-commercial services.  Proposals are being requested and the attached Data Requirements List and applicable instructions are included with this announcement.  The upcoming solicitation number will be N00174-12-R-0043, and will be issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).

The Contractors support shall be in accordance with applicable Technical Repair Standards (TRS), Engineering Drawings and Standards, technical guidance and instruction identified at time of tasking to support specific Fleet Requirements. This will be coordinated by the GWSRP Program Manager (PM) or designee, and in their absence, the In-Service Engineering Agents (ISEA), Ship Support Activity (SSA) or Regional Maintenance Centers (RMC) acting on the behalf of GWSRP.
  

The Government intends to make a single award resulting from the solicitation to the responsible offeror whose submissions, which comply with the instructions and conform to the solicitation, will be the most advantageous BEST VALUE to the Government.  Best value will be determined based on an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors for award.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate the offers: (a) technical capability of the items and services offered to meet the minimum needs of the Government based on examination of technical approach narrative, relevant corporate experience, equipment, and personnel resources; (b) Past Performance (see FAR 52.212-1(b)(10)); and (c) Cost.
  These factors are of equal importance.   All non-priced factors, when combined, are approximately equal to Cost in importance.  However, Cost becomes more of a deciding factor of importance when offerors receive similar ratings for the other factors.  General statements, that the offeror can or will comply with the requirements, that standard procedures will be used, that well known techniques will be used, or that paraphrases the RFQs specifications in whole or in part, will not constitute compliance with the mandatory requirements concerning the content of the technical proposal.

Copies of solicitation N00174-12-R-0043 will NOT be emailed, faxed, mailed or provided in person.  These types of requests WILL NOT BE ACKNOWLEDGED.
  This synopsis is being posted to both Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.eps.gov and Navy Electronic Commerce On-Line (NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopses and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by Naval Sea Systems Command.  NOTE:  Offerors are ineligible for award unless registered in DODs Central Contractor Registration Database which has now been integrated with the System for Award Management (SAM).

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City Division, Panama City, FL intends to modify the Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity contract N61331-09-D-0004, sole sourced to Concurrent Technologies Corporation (CTC), 100 CTC Drive, Johnstown, PA 15904-1935 to provide engineering and technical support services for the modification of the Carriage, Stream, Tow and Recovery System (CSTRS) design as required for the development of the Organic Airborne Mine Countermeasures (OAMCM). The contractor will modify, prototype, and flight test the CSTRS and develop the production level design changes to incorporate Airborne Mine Countermeasures (AMCM) capabilities into the CSTRS. The contract modification is to extend the period of performance by one year from five years to six years and increase the ceiling amount.
 This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. CTC is the sole developer, integrator and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) for the CSTRS. CTC possesses the detail knowledge of the CSTRS design required for the interface of the OAMCM systems and the aircraft. Therefore, CTC is the only source possessing the expertise, technical data, equipment, and experienced personnel necessary to successfully and safely modify and flight test CSTRS as well as develop the production level design. There are no other possible sources that can satisfy this requirement without significant additional cost to the Government.  The NAICS code is 541330 with a small business size standard of $14,000,000 and the FSC code is AD25.
 

The NSWCPC has implemented Electronic Commerce (EC) in the acquisition area.  Therefore, this synopsis and any applicable amendments will be available at https://www.fbo.gov.  Vendors should regularly access this web site to ensure that they have downloaded all amendments.

Lockheed Martin is the design agent, system integrator and the NAVSEA approved source of supply and certified depot for the AN/UYQ-70(V) weapon system. NAVSUP WSS does not possess the necessary engineering drawing masters, developmental specifications, engineering change data, interface specifications, etc. required
to source these parts to another vendor other than Lockheed Martin. NAVSUP WSS does not have required Navy technical support activity (TSA) or in-service engineering support approval to parts procured or repaired by sources other than
Lockheed Martin. Data is not currently available for competition; however NAVSUP
WSS has requested Lockheed Martin to provide detailed analysis and justification
for value-added parts. Upon receipt of this data it will be reviewed by the AN/UYQ-70(V) host ISEA community, which will allow the NAVSUP WSS to properly breakout parts without negatively impacting host weapon system certification, configuration management and operating systems. This review is expected to take up to a year due to the range of the items in the AN/UYQ-70(V) product line. -SEE NOTES 9, 22, 26

Orders issued under the Basic Ordering Agreement and pursuant to this synopsis will be issued pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).

This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made.

If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at the NAVSUP WSS, submit a copy of the cover letter, which forwarded your request for source approval, with your offer. Offers received failing to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation.
 Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

<RESPDATE>010913
<CONTACT>Ivan V. Damaso, Contract Specialist, Phone 9177908708, Email ivan.v.damaso@usace.army.mil
<DESC><br />This project is restricted in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c )(4) International Agreement to Danish and Greenlandic firms only.
<p><br />The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New York District intends to issue a solicitation package seeking to award a firm-fixed-price contract for the construction of a new 3,012 SM, 3-story dormitory facility. This will be a competitive, Invitation for Bids (IFB), bid opening. The facility will be built with arctic foundations in the permafrost; it will be steel frame, insulated panel exterior, and pitched metal roof. The work includes site improvements, and all utilities and communications. The contractor will furnish all supervision, plant, labor, materials, tools, and equipment to construct the facility.</p>
<p>General Conditions at Thule Air Base: The location of Thule Air Base limits exterior work to the months of June through September, although work is sometimes possible in May or October. Additionally, Thule's location demands that all supplies/personnel must be shipped/transported in/out via air/sealift. Thule Air Base is not a commercial air/sea port and there is no other access. Shipping schedules are dictated by Defense contracts, and materials and labor are not available locally. The region is glaciated and the existing soil is generally permafrost, which exists from 1 to 6 feet below the surface and to a measured depth of 1,600 feet. Average winter temperature is 20 to 30 degrees Fahrenheit below zero while average summer temperature is 40 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit above zero. One annual military cargo sealift departs from Norfolk, Virginia to Thule AB approximately 1 July. There are two sealifts that go from Copenhagen, Denmark to Thule AB: one in July and one in August. Airlifting any materials or equipment via military aircraft is very expensive and only on an emergency-need basis. The project magnitude is US$15 - $25 Million. The performance period shall be approximately 2 years from issuance of the Notice to Proceed (NTP).</p>
<p>Anticipate the plans and specifications to be posted electronically on or about 5 November 2012 via the Federal Business Opportunities website at www.fbo.gov, with bids due on or about 9 January 2013. Any and all amendments shall be likewise posted. Hard copies will not be available. It is the contractor's responsibility to monitor the FedBizOpps website for any amendments. Award will be made to the lowest responsible bidder.</p>
<p>A Dual Bid Opening will be held simultaneously at the New York District and in Copenhagen, Denmark on or about 9 January 2013. More information as to the exact date, time, and location will be included in the solicitation, as well as instructions pertaining to the Dual Bid Opening.</p>
<p>All questions must be submitted in writing via email, fax, or mail to the POC. The media selected for issuance of Synopsis/Solicitation and amendments shall solely be at the discretion of the Government; accordingly, the media utilized for this project shall be the internet. Telephone, email, or fax requests for the solicitation will not be accepted or honored. Paper copies of this solicitation and amendments, if any, will not be available or issued. Plans and specifications will NOT be provided in hard paper copy or CD-ROM format. The solicitation and all amendments for this acquisition will be posted on a secure Government website known as FedBizOpps (www.fbo.gov) once the solicitation is issued. Interested parties may download and print the solicitation at no charge from the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website, https://www.fbo.gov. The system called FedBizOpps has been upgraded as a web-based dissemination tool designed to safeguard acquisition-related information for all federal agencies. Business opportunities can be located in FedBizOpps or the Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) acquisition business website, https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi. To keep informed of changes, check https://www.fbo.gov frequently. Some contractor tools are as follows; 1. Register to receive notification, and 2. Subscribe to the mailing list for specific solicitation at FedBizOpps, https://www.fbo.gov. A hyperlink posted in FedBizOpps will direct vendors to FedBizOpps to download solicitations, plans, specifications, and amendments. Project specification files and drawings are portable document files (PDF).</p>

<DESC>This is a sources sought announcement in anticipation of a potential Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) Class support procurement. The Naval Sea Systems Command is conducting market research to determine industry capability and interest in the Planning Yard Design Services. The LCS Planning Yard services include, but not limited to: technical and engineering support services, including operations planning; system analysis; maintenance, repair, material support; alteration design and planning; logistics support; and training support. The Naval Sea Systems Command is especially interested in determining small business capability and interest in performing class design support services on LCS ships. These activities will begin at contract award (anticipated September 2013), and continuing for a period of performance of five years: one year plus four one-year options.
 

NAVSEA intends to pursue for procurement availability in the following types of planning yard support services: Operating Cycle Integration Program Management; Work Integration Package Engineering; Type Commander (TYCOM) response; rotatable equipment pool inventory management; Ship Configuration Logistics Support Information System (SCLSIS) support; Configuration Data Management (CDM); Research Engineering and Modeling; Provisioned Items Order; cost and feasibility studies,  Integrated Planning Yard (IPY) Material Support; Provisioning Technical Documentation; Naval Ships Engineering Drawing Repository (NSEDR) system input and data management; interface and coordination with Regional Maintenance Centers RMCs and Fleet entities; design alteration and modification development, review and tracing; and managing related class Ship Selected Record Documents (SSRD) and Hull Mechanical and Electrical (HM &E) engineering standardization efforts.
 Additionally, unique to the LCS Sustainment Strategy, the Planning Yard will support Preventative and Planned Maintenance System (PMS) item development and scheduling. This contract will apply to both LCS ship variants, and will be awarded to a prime contractor for a base plus four one-year options. 

The Government has provided the following information as an attachment to this sources sought announcement:

1.	The draft solicitation statement of work.

Interested companies should submit, on company letterhead, a notice of interest including the name, telephone number, mailing address, and e-mail address of one point of contact to Commander, Naval Sea Systems Command, Attn: Mr. Alvin Hill (SEA 024), Ms.
 Michaella Easley (SEA 024), and CDR Jonathan Gray (SEA 024). Please scan your letter of interest and e-mail it to alvin.l.hill@navy.mil, Michaella.Easley@navy.mil, and Jonathan.Gray3@navy.mil with LCS Planning Yard Sources Sought Response in the subject field. The notice of interest should include a brief description of your company and its capabilities as they relate to the requirements set forth on this announcement, and answer the following specific questions. Please limit your response to no more than 15 pages.

1.	Is your company a small or large business as defined by the Small Business Administration (SBA)?

2.	How many employees does your company have?

3.	Does your company have a website? If so, what is your companys website address?

4.	Does your company have adequate financial resources to perform the contract, or the ability to obtain them? As part of your answer to this question, please answer the following sub-questions.
a.	Please describe the financial requirements you expect that your company would have as you stand up the necessary workforce and production materials to complete the contract, and how you'll meet the contracts correspondent cash flow requirements.
 
b.	Please provide a cash flow statement that will show the sources and uses of funds necessary to complete this contract, in concert with all of your companys other financial commitments. As part of this cash flow statement, please identify the expected maximum amount of sales outstanding that your company expects you would need to be able to finance prior to reimbursement by the Government.
c.	Please explain where the sources of cash flow will come from (be it from Government invoice payments, internal cash reserves, or external financing such as issuing new debt or selling equity). Please demonstrate the extent of your company's current access to credit and your companys capacity for future credit in terms of unencumbered physical assets.
 Please tell us the amount of cash and other liquid assets your company has on hand to use as working capital to meet the contracts cash flow requirements. Please describe how your sources of cash and credit will sufficiently meet your cash flow requirements in concert with other sources. 
d.	Please explain all the assumptions underlying this cash flow statement. 
e.	Please discuss your current and future expected financial obligations (in terms of outstanding and future expected liabilities) and your companys ability to meet them. Please discuss any risks that might inhibit your companys ability to meet these requirements and how your company is working to mitigate those risks.

5.	Will your company, given all provided information, be able to comply with the required or proposed delivery or performance schedule, taking into consideration all existing commercial and governmental business commitments?

6.	Does your company have a performance record for work similar to work sought here? If so, please provide examples of recent performance within the past three years.

7.	Does your company have the necessary organization, experience, accounting and operational controls, and technical skills, or the ability to obtain them (including, as appropriate, such elements as production control procedures, property control systems, quality assurance measures, and safety programs applicable to materials to be produced or services to be performed by the prospective contractor and subcontractors)?  

8.	Does your company have the necessary production, construction, and technical equipment and facilities, or the ability to obtain them? As part of your answer to this question, please answer the following sub-questions.

9.	Strategic Planning/Program Management.
 Strategic Planning/Program Management plays a critical role in sustainment contracts due to the overlap of planning events, and inter-availabilities (both Continuous (CM) and Emergent (EM) Maintenance Availabilities, and for homeported, visiting, and deployed LCS Class ships that could require repair/maintenance at short notice. The contractor plays an important role in the planning maintenance and modernization of the surface Navy.  This contract is considered a partnership between the Navy and the prime. The contractor is expected to become a subject matter expert on the applicable ships. What is your companys experience/strategy in managing/executing several comprehensive/technically challenging planning yard activities simultaneously?

10.	Surge Capacity.
 The prime is expected to have surge capacity due to flex in operational schedules of the Navy. Every ship could require short notice repair/maintenance while deployed anywhere in the world, which would require the contractor personnel to travel to remote locations in support. It is not uncommon for primes to have teaming partners to handle such needs. In other words, management responsiveness is essential for success as prime. What is your companys strategy for surge/emergent requirements and accomplishing them?

11.	Integration. Integration strategy is a key role of the prime contractor. The prime is expected to work with the Navy In-service Engineering Agents (Government and Contractor) and databases as well as different vendors, subcontractors and customers to ensure successful execution of planning yard support, as well as the ability to provide a high quality product through sound Engineering practices, technical expertise and program management.
 The prime will need to integrate schedules with the LCS maintenance provider and customers such as Type Commander(s), LCS Squadron(s), Naval Sea Systems Command, ships force, etc. All work must be properly scheduled and managed. This requirement mandates a sound plan for managing subcontracts as well. What is your companys integration strategy, especially in regard to managing subcontractors?

12.	Accounting Methodology. Sound financial tools and practices such as a certified accounting system, EVMS reporting, interface/approval with DCAA and approved purchasing systems are required to adequately provide proper billing to the Navy. The accounting system would show the breakout of direct, indirect and overhead charges.
 In addition, the accounting system would be used to manage the business with vendors as required. While it is important to have an integrated schedule; it is equally important to have cost controls in place.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT announcement. The Government is seeking to identify qualified large and small business sources under 2007 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 541990 (Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services). The small business size standard is $14 million.  This notice is for market research purposes only and IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.  The Government will not reimburse respondents for any costs incurred in preparation of a response to this notice. For market research purposes only small businesses should provide responses.<br><br>Some of the following requirments were previously posted under W912DY-12-R-0016, Sources Sought: Global Logistics and Other Support Services to DoD (GLOSS DoD).<br><br><br>1. CONTRACT INFORMATION: The objective of this Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) is for Contractors to provide Life Health and Safety (LHS) support at existing and any future U.S. Military bases and camps worldwide.  The contracts are anticipated to be awarded in 2013 with a one-year base period and four one-year option periods, for a total ordering period of at least five years during which to compete for task orders.  The programmatic value of all task orders awarded under all of the ID/IQ contracts is $450M.<br><br>Interested sources should respond to the questions presented within this announcement in order to facilitate the Government's market research efforts.  The Government will analyze all responses and determine if the pool of qualified and interested small business firms is significant enough for a total set-aside competition restricted to small businesses or for a partial set-aside competition restricted to small businesses.  If the determination is made that there are not enough qualified and/or interested small business firms to perform this requirement, the Government may solicit the acquisition as an unrestricted full and open competition.  The Government does not intend to rank submittals or provide any reply to interested firms. <br><br><br>2. PROJECT INFORMATION: The primary focus of this effort is to provide corrective actions of life, health and safety hazards existing at U.S. occupied facilities worldwide and including US Forces-Afghanistan (USFOR-A).  As part of the overall objective of Life, Health, and Safety (LHS) support the contractor may be tasked to provide electrical inspection and repair, fire inspection, fire prevention training, other independent support services as needed at locations throughout the world. This training supports fire safety concepts, fire protection and alarm systems, building codes and National Fire Codes and Standards. The fire safety training also serves to ensure that potential electrical risks are reduced, which would decrease LHS hazards identified during the electrical inspections.  The requirement will also include generator inspections and power optimization recommendations for systems providing low voltage electrical power to inspected facilities.  <br><br>Contractors will be asked to provide their own logistical support for their employees.  As part of the overall logistical support requirements, the contractor may be required to establish and operate temporary base camps, provide camp/facility and convoy security, provide life support to other contractors utilizing base camp facilities and while complying with established safety guidelines and mandates.  Contractors will utilize existing logistical support provided by the U.S. Military as much as possible, but may be asked to become 100% independent of such support. A primary capability requirement is for contractors to provide logistical support for their own personnel and government civilians overseeing the task.<br> <br><br>3. SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: Interested firms should submit a document describing relevant demonstrated experience and qualifications via email Michael.D.Ashworth@usace.army.mil and Tonju.L.Butler@usace.army.mil no later than Friday, 18 May 2012, 1600 Central Time.

<SUBJECT>LOW METALLIC SIGNATURE MINE DETECTOR
<SOLNBR>M6785412I5089

<CONTACT>Mark C. Green, Phone 7034323116, Email mark.c.green@usmc.mil
<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT FOR<br />LOW METALLIC SIGNATURE MINE DETECTOR
<p><br />The Marine Corps Systems Command, Program Manager for Combat Support Systems (PM CSS) is conducting a market survey to identify potential sources and industry capabilities to design, develop, test, manufacture and deliver the next generation handheld explosives hazard detection system, the Low Metallic Signature Mine Detector (LMS MD).</p>
<p>1. Description: The LMS MD will be the material solution to the capability gap that currently exists in the detection of explosive devices. It is a light-weight, man-portable, handheld detection system that is capable of detecting traditional, low-metallic and non-metallic mines and explosive devices. It will enable the mobility of dismounted forces by significantly increasing their ability to locate, mark, avoid, and/or reduce explosive threats. Additionally, it will enhance explosives threat identification and categorization by discriminating between detected mines and improvised explosive devices that contain little to no metallic content, to include unexploded ordnance. As a system to be used by Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Technicians, the discriminating capability of the LMS MD will enable the neutralization and exploitation of explosive devises with little metallic content, to include their initiating systems.</p>
<p>2. Specification: The following performance and functional characteristics represent the minimum threshold and objective level capabilities of the LMS MD.<br />a. Detection. The LMS MD shall be capable of detecting metallic, low metallic and non-metallic symmetric and asymmetric threats in dry and wet environments in loam, sand, clay and river rock test substrates containing indigenous vegetation, and in close proximity to operational vehicles. Note: Loam is defined as a combination of 40% silt, 40% sand and 20% clay. The threshold (T) probability of detection [P(d)] is 85% for baseline targets, while the objective (O) is 95% P(d) for less metallic or deeper buried threats.<br />The LMS MD shall have an 85% P(d) for low metallic explosive hazards (EH) with 0.09 oz. (2.5 grams) of mild steel or aluminum and low metallic asymmetric components at a depth of 4 inches (T).<br />The LMS MD shall have an 85% P(d) for high metallic EHs with 3.5 oz. (100 grams) of mild steel or aluminum at a depth of 12 inches (T).<br />The LMS MD shall have an 85% P(d) for buried non-metallic components with a 24 square inch (sq. in.) horizontal surface area (with 3in. cross section) (T) and a 95% P(d) for a buried non-metallic component with a circular surface area equal to or less than 7 sq. in. (3in. diameter). <br />The LMS MD shall have an 85% P(d) for non-metallic components with a 100 sq. in. horizontal surface area (with a 3 inch cross section) at a depth of 12 inches (T).<br />b. Endurance. The LMS MD shall be capable of 8 (T) and 16.5 (O) hours of continuous active sweeping operation in climatic conditions with temperatures from -25&deg;F to +120&deg;F without degradation of system performance and/or power source recharge or replacement. The LMS MD shall use batteries that have been approved by DoD for shipboard storage/use, and aircraft transport (T), or batteries currently available within the DoD supply system (O).<br />Where applicable the LMS MD battery shall be rechargeable using 100-240VAC (50Hz-60Hz) and 11-36VDC power sources. <br />Where applicable, the LMS MD shall operate on MILSPEC standard communication batteries or a standard stock system alkaline or rechargeable battery(s). The LMS MD shall have an auxiliary power source adapter that can operate on MILSPEC standard communication batteries or standard stock system alkaline or rechargeable battery(s).<br />c. False Alarm Rates (FAR). The false alarm rate (FAR) is defined as the percentage of total detections where the detector alerts the operator when no underground object is present. The FAR associated with symmetric and asymmetric targets differ due to their inherit designs. The methodology for measurement is defined as the number of false alarms per 25 square meters.</p>
<p>Symmetric targets are items manufactured and characterized by fixed and known design standards and specification. Accordingly, symmetric targets with these fixed and known characteristics (sizes, shapes, functionalities, metallic signatures, etc.) tend to be more exploitable/detectable then ad hoc asymmetric designed targets. Symmetric targets are typically of an all-inclusive designed device (firing mechanism, detonator, and main explosive charge) common to military ordnance items (mines, grenades, projectiles etc.). The LMS MD shall have a FAR of no greater than 5 percent (T) and 3 percent (O) for symmetric targets.<br />Asymmetric threats or improvised explosive devices (IED) have no standard exploitable design characteristics. No design is exactly the same and quite often crudely assembled from separate components (main charge, initiation device, detonator, power supply, and circuitry) into a randomly designed explosive hazard. The LMS MD shall have a FAR of no greater than 10 percent (T) and 5 percent (O) for asymmetric targets.</p>
<p>d. The LMS MD shall have an "instant-on" start-up time of less than 90 seconds (T) and 60 seconds (O) from its pack stowed condition, to set-up and be ready for operation in any of the detection modes of operation. The start-up time is defined as the time when the LMS MD is powered ON to the time it is ready for operation in any of the detection modes of operation.</p>
<p>e. Operational Weight. In its operational configuration, the LMS MD shall weigh less than 9.0 lbs (T) and less than 5.0 lbs (O). When configured for operation, the system will include the wand, search head, external control unit, battery and headset, but not the carrying case, calibration equipment, spare power supplies or optional equipment.</p>
<p>f. Modular Design. The LMS MD shall have a modular design that allows for components to be interchangeable between detectors (T) and does not require recalibration afterward (O). <br />3. The Government is interested in receiving your insight on the aforementioned proposed acquisition. Interested sources that possess the technical capability and resources to fulfill the Government's requirements stated herein are invited to provide a Letter of Interest and a Capability Statement. Responses should include at a minimum:<br />a. Product literature, including a description of the system and validating information in the form of independent or government conducted testing supporting claims that the proposed system meets the system performance specification. If the system cannot meet one or more of the thresholds contained in this synopsis, explain the best capability of the system in that area. Include information of any capabilities or optional capabilities above and beyond the specification contained in this notification.<br />b. Pricing Information<br />c. Production and delivery capability<br />d. Capability to provide parts and repair support<br />e. Past performance information detailing any experience with hand-held mine detection systems in general and ground penetrating radar in particular<br />Responses shall be submitted electronically and should not exceed more than (12) pages, to include all images, data displays, charts, graphs, and tables. Reponses shall be prepared in Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat Reader and the font size shall not be smaller than 12-point Times New Roman or Courier New.<br />Submit responses and questions regarding the RFI via email no later than 4:00 p.m. EDT Thursday, 8 November 2012 to mark.c.green@usmc.mil. The email subject line should include the phrase "Low Metallic Signature Mine Detector Response to Request for Information".<br />This sources-sought/Request For Information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request For Proposal (RFP) or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire follow-on acquisition. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of submission of responses to this RFI and Government use of such information. The Government recognizes that proprietary data may be part of this effort. If so included, clearly mark such restricted or proprietary data and present it as an addendum to the non-restricted/non-proprietary information.</p>

<DESC>This is sources sought announcement only. The purpose of this notice is to conduct market research and obtain information from qualified businesses with special interest in seeking: Small Businesses (SB); VA certified Service Disabled Veteran owned Business (SDVOSB), Veteran Owned Small Business (VOSB) small business concerns; and vendors who hold GSA/FSS schedules. No solicitation is being issued at this time. This notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to ultimately award a contract, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach. All information submitted in response to this announcement is voluntary; the Government will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the Government.

The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Network Contracting office 19, and the Grand Junction (GJ) VA Medical Center located: 2121 North Avenue, Grand Junction, Colorado anticipates a requirement for window washing services for the VA Hospital and campus buildings located at 2121 North Avenue, Grand Junction, CO 81501-0731.

Contractor shall furnish all labor, supervision, management support, transportation, supplies, equipment and materials necessary for the accomplishment of complete window washing as described below.  Primary tasks include the following:

	1.	Cleaning all glazed surfaces (windows) - exterior, interior, where installed on all 	specified buildings.
	2.	Cleaning of window frames, sills, sashes, and ledges to remove all dirt, greases, paint, 	oils, nicotine, and any other foreign matter with an approved cleaning agent.  (MSDS must be 	provided).
	3.	Damage to windows, frames or other surfaces by the Contractor will be required to be 	replaced by the Contractor.
	4.	When the Contractor is unable to gain access to any area, the Contracting Officer's 	Representative (COR) will be notified so that coordination can be made for easy access.
	5. 	Any other problems encountered by the Contractor, which prevents any items within 	this contract to be cleaned, the Contractor will notify the COR.
	6. 	An estimate of the number of windows in each building is listed below.  It is the 	responsibility of the Contractor to make its own count of windows.  All windows and other 	identified tasks are to be cleaned within the time period specified.
	7. 	All work must be performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Federal, State and 	local ordinances.  All safety practices prescribed by these agencies shall be followed.
	8. 	Window washing services are for approximately 686 windows.  Includes main hospital 	building and several buildings located on the VA campus; cleaning comprise exterior and 	interior windows.  

CONTRACTOR EQUIPMENT AND SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

Exterior windows must be cleaned by scaffolding, ladders, or an aerial bucket/basket type of equipment.  The term scaffolding is a set-up type, not from the roof.  No other methods are acceptable, unless previously approved by the Contracting Officer in conjunction with the Medical Center's Safety Officer.  If a boom-type piece of equipment is used coordination must be made with the COR to ensure proper protection for the grounds.  Any damage to the grounds or building caused by the contractor will be repaired by the Contractor within the timeframe specified by the COR.  Past experience has proven that some windows may require more than normal effort in order to produce acceptable results.  Some windows may require special techniques in opening windows, removal of protective Plexiglas for cleaning, etc.

SCHEDULING

	a. Start/Finish Dates: The COR will provide start/finish dates; respectively the spring and fall of each calendar year (the suggested dates are April and October).  Window washing services are required in the spring and fall of each year and must be completed within 7-10 days of the start date.

	b. Daily Work Schedule: COR will provide a schedule of the specific areas that the Contractor will be working in twenty-four (24) hours before proceeding. 

The appropriate NAICS Code 561720 and the small business size standard are $25.5. Interested firms are reminded that in accordance with FAR 4.12, prospective contractors shall complete electronic annual representations and certifications in conjunction with FAR 4.11 required registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to award of a contract.

ALL INQUIRIES AND OFFEROR CAPABILITY STATEMENTS SHALL BE MADE TO: Contracting Officer: Steven R. Gardner; NCO19, Grand Junction, Colorado; Phone: 970-270-9503; email: STEVEN.GARDNER@VA.GOV

<DESC>This is a NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE CONTRACT. The Army Contracting Command Aberdeen Proving Ground, Tenant Contracting Division, 4118 Susquehanna Avenue, Aberdeen Proving Ground MD 21005 has a requirement to procure MSD Custom Bio Kits, in support of the Edgewood Chemical Biological Center (ECBC) Environmental Monitoring Laboratory (EML), located at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland. <br />CLIN 0001: MSD Bio Kit B, Anthracis, Part Number R99XX-1<br />CLIN 0002: MSD Bio Kit Neurotoxin A, Part Number R99XX-1<br />CLIN 0003: MSD Bio Kit F. Tularensis, Part Number R99XX-1<br />CLIN 0004: MSD Bio Kit Ricin, Part Number R99XX-1<br />CLIN 0005: MSD Bio Kit Staphylococcol Enterotoxin B (SEB), Part Number R99XX-1<br />CLIN 0006: MSD Bio Kit Vaccinia, Part Number R99XX-1<br />CLIN 0007: MSD Bio Kit Y. Pestis, Part Number R99XX-1<br />CLIN 0008: MSD Bio Kit VEE, Part Number R99XX-1<br />CLIN 0009: MSD Bio Kit Q Fever, Part Number R99XX-1<br />CLIN 0010: MSD Bio Kit Brucella, Part Number R99XX-1<br />The Government intends to award a firm-fixed priced sole source contract to MESO SCALE Defense 9238 Gaither Road, Gaithersburg, MD 20877. ECBC requires reagents to detect biowarfare agents by electrochemiluminescence. An MSD ECL instrument, and assays specifically designed to be used in conjunction with the instrument, have been validated and is approved for use. Not obtaining this requirement for MSD assays and reagents on time will result in ECC's mission failure by failing to provide validated laboratory capabilities. In addition using an untested system for sample analysis is unacceptable under the ISO 17025 quality guidelines and would put ECBC at risk of losing its testing accreditation which would thus prevent ECBC from performing operations. The associated North America Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 334516 and the Business Size Standard is 500.<br />All response received within 10 days after date of publication of this notice will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement no later than 10:00 AM EST, October 31, 2012. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in future procurements.<br />For questions concerning this Notice of Intent, contact Ms. Susan Sowa, susan.l.sowa.civ@mail.mil and Ms. Maureen Cameron, maureen.v.cameron.civ@mail.mil. Posting date of this requirement is October 19, 2012. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. NO TELEPHONE REQUESTS WILL BE HONORED.<br />

<DESC><p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is not a request for proposal and does not constitute a solicitation. No proposals or unsolicited proposals will be accepted. All information received in response, however, will be handled as Proprietary Information in the same manner as an offer. The Government will not pay for any information received under or associated with this RFI. Any expenses associated with a response are the sole responsibility of the responder. Responses will not be returned. Any pricing or cost information received will be non-binding and used for informational purposes only. Failure to respond will not in any way prevent a potential offeror from participation in future solicitations. The purpose of this RFI is to conduct market research on the subject of Performance Based Logistics (PBL) as required by DLAD <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">90.15.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Participation by </span>DLA Troop Support's commercial industry partners is encouraged. All information provided will be given consideration and may influence the development of future proposal requests.</p>
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">DLA Troop Support, Subsistence CONUS Division seeks to motivate Subsistence Prime Vendor contractors to provide fill rates that approach as near to 100% as possible by including Performance Based Distribution Fees (PBDF's) in Navy Ships contracts. </span><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">The proposal is for an Awardee to maintain at least a 98% fill rate per line and a minimum performance standard of 85% on the Worldwide Food Audit for the life of the contract. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The categories to be evaluated in the Worldwide Food Audit are meat, poultry, seafood, and processed products. The actual distribution fees paid as proposed, however, have the potential to be smaller or greater based on the performance of the contractor as measured by the actual product fill rate and Worldwide Food Audit results.</span></p>
<p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">Fill rate calculations are proposed to be based on a seven day lead time and will be recorded by line item. Any line item receiving less than 98% will be recorded as a zero score. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Zero scores will be included in the fill rate calculation to determine the overall fill rate for a specified time period.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For example, the overall or average fill rate for ten (10) lines in which nine (9) lines have a score of 100% and one (1) line has a score of 97% (counted as zero) will be 90%. </span></p>

<p>52.27-103-72A DOJ CONTRACTOR RESIDENCY REQUIREMENT (JUNE 2004)<br />For three of the five years immediately prior to submission of an offer/bid/quote, or prior to performance under a contract or commitment, individuals or contractor employees providing<br />services must have:<br />1. legally resided in the United States (U.S.);<br />2. worked for the U.S. overseas in a Federal or military capacity; or<br />3. been a dependent of a Federal or military employee serving overseas.<br />If the individual is not a U.S. citizen, they must be from a country allied with the U.S. The following website provides current information regarding allied countries: http://www.opm,gov/employ/html/citizen.htm . By signing this contract or commitment document, or by commencing performance, the contractor agrees to this restriction.</p>
<p>52.239-101 Information Technology Security DOJ Order 2640.2F (Nov 2008)<br />Department of Justice (DOJ) Order 2640.2F prohibits the use of non-U.S. citizens in the performance of this contract or commitment for any position that involves access to or assisting in the development, operation, management, or maintenance of any DOJ Information Technology System. By signing this contract or by beginning performance, the contractor agrees to this restriction.<br /><br />52.24-403-70 NOTICE OF CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS (OCT 2005)<br />Compliance with Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) and Federal Information Processing Standard Publication 201 (FIPS 201)1 entitled "Personal Identification Verification (PIV) for Federal Employees and Contractors," Phase I.<br /><br />1. Long-Term Contractor Personnel:<br />In order to be compliant with HSPD-12/PIV I, the following investigative requirements must be met for each new long-term2 contractor employee whose background investigation (BI) process begins on or after October 27, 2005:<br /><br />a. Contractor Personnel must present two forms of identification in original form prior to<br />badge issuance (acceptable documents are listed in Form I-9, OMB No. 1615-0047, "Employment Eligibility Verification, " and at least one document must be a valid State or Federal government-issued picture ID);<br />b. Contractor Personnel must appear in person at least once before a DOJ official who is responsible for checking the identification documents. This identity proofing must be completed sometime during the clearance process but prior to badge issuance and must be documented by the DOJ official;<br />c. Contractor Personnel must undergo a BI commensurate with the designated risk level associated with the duties of each position. Outlined below are the minimum BI requirements for each risk level:<br />&bull; High Risk - Background Investigation (5 year scope)<br />&bull; Moderate Risk - Limited Background Investigation (LBI) or Minimum<br />Background Investigation (MBI)<br />&bull; Low Risk - National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) investigation<br />d. The pre-appointment BI waiver requirements for all position sensitivity levels are a:<br />1) Favorable review of the security questionnaire form;<br />2) Favorable fingerprint results;<br />3) Favorable credit report, if required;3<br />4) Waiver request memorandum, including both the Office of Personnel<br />Management schedule date and position sensitivity/risk level; and<br />5) Favorable review of the National Agency Check (NAC)4 portion of the applicable BI that is determined by position sensitivity/risk level.<br />A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements.<br />If the NAC is not received within five days of OPM ' s scheduling date, the badge can be issued based on a favorable review of the Security Questionnaire and the Federal Bureau of Investigation Criminal History Check (i.e., fingerprint check results).<br />e. Badge re-validation will occur once the investigation is completed and favorably adjudicated. If the BI results so justify, badges issued under these procedures will be suspended or revoked.<br />2. Short-Term Contractor Personnel:<br />It is the policy of the DOJ that short-term contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or fewer are subject to the identity proofing requirements listed in items 1a. and 1b. above. The pre-appointment waiver requirements for short-term contractors are:<br />a. Favorable review of the security questionnaire form;<br />b. Favorable fingerprint results;<br />c. Favorable credit report, if required;5 and<br />d. Waiver request memorandum indicating both the position sensitivity/risk level and the duration of the appointment. The commensurate BI does not need to be initiated. A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements and the badge will expire six months from the date of issuance. This process can only be used once for a short-term contractor in a twelve month period. This will ensure that any consecutive short-term<br />appointments are subject to the full PIV-I identity proofing process.<br />For example, if a contractor employee requires daily access for a three or four-week period, this contractor would be cleared according to the above short-term requirements. However, if a second request is submitted for the same contractor employee within a twelve-month period for the purpose of extending the initial contract or for employment under a totally different contract<br />for another three or four-week period, this contractor would now be considered "long-term" and must be cleared according to the long-term requirements as stated in this interim policy.<br /><br />3. Intermittent Contractors:<br />An exception to the above-mentioned short-term requirements would be intermittent contractors.<br />a. For purposes of this policy, "intermittent" is defined as those contractor employees needing access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for a maximum of one day per week, regardless of the duration of the required intermittent access. For example, the water delivery contractor that delivers water one time each week and is working on a one-year contract.<br />b. Contractors requiring intermittent access should follow the Department's escort policy. Please reference the August 11, 2004, and January 29, 2001, Department Security Officer policy memoranda that conveys the requirements for contractor facility escorted access.<br />c. Due to extenuating circumstances, if a component requests unescorted access or DOJ IT system access for an intermittent contractor, the same pre-employment background investigation waiver requirements that apply to short-term contractors are required.<br />d. If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the contractor will only be issued a daily badge. The daily badge will be issued upon entrance into a DOJ facility or space and must be returned upon exiting the same facility or space.<br />e. If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the approval will not exceed one year.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- <br />(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; <br />(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- <br />(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or <br />(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and <br />(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. <br />Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs <br />(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. <br />(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. <br />(1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: <br />(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or <br />(ii) Stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to an acquisition described in section 835(b)(1) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1). <br />(2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. <br />(3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. <br />(d) Special rule for related partnerships.

The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. <br />(1) Certain stock disregarded.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below. All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401 Ft.

  (2)  The Contractor?s CAGE code is in the SAM database; and 
  (3)  The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record ?Active?.

  (2)  The SAM registration shall be for the same name and address identified on the contract, with its associated CAGE code and DUNS or DUNS+4.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete.

Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database.  Information provided to the Contractor?s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. 
(h)  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.
(End of Clause) <BR> <BR>Questions concerning this quote must be submitted by 0900 ET on Monday, October 22nd, to reasonably expect a response from the Government. Those questions not received within the prescribed time and date WILL NOT be considered. <BR> <BR>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

<DESC><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Executive Summary for Request for Proposal (RFP) FA8629-12-R-2400, Combat Rescue Helicopter (CRH) Program:<br /></span><br /></strong>1. The Government invites your company to submit a proposal in response to the subject RFP. This program will replace the USAF aging HH-60G Pave Hawk helicopter fleet with new air vehicles, training systems, and product support as required for the Personnel Recovery (PR) mission. The requirement is for 112 new air vehicles (most probable quantity); however, the RFP has been structured to handle fluctuations of quantities.<br /><br />2. The CRH system acquisition (air vehicles, training systems, and product support) will use a single Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15 contract with a planned award in the fourth quarter of FY13. If all options are exercised, the period of performance will span approximately 14 years and will include the development, integration, production, and initial sustainment of the entire CRH system. The contract will be Fixed-Price Incentive Firm (FPIF) for Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) and FPIF options for Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP). Full Rate Production (FRP) options will be Firm Fixed-Price (FFP). A small portion of the contract will be a combination of FFP and Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) in order to cover "over and above" repairs and studies and analyses. A total of nine air vehicles will be procured during EMD, 18 air vehicles in LRIP, and the remaining quantity (85) will be procured during FRP assuming all options are exercised at the most probable quantity.<br /><br />3. The competitively awarded CRH contract will incentivize you to reduce costs and share in the savings through the FPIF contract during EMD and LRIP. The FPIF arrangement includes a mandatory profit at target cost of 11% for a cost incentive with a mandatory ceiling percentage of 120% and a mandatory 50/50 share ratio. In addition, 1% of target cost has been set aside for schedule performance incentive.<br /><br />4. You are hereby notified that all amendments to this RFP, along with any notices pertaining to this RFP, will be provided via electronic means only. All amendments and notices will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities website (FedBizOpps) at www.fbo.gov. It is your responsibility to access the information. No paper copies will be distributed.<br /><br />5. To receive a copy of the classified annex to the System Specification, you need to send your request to the CRH mailbox, CRH@wpafb.af.mil, with the following information to receive the CRH Classified Annex: Company Name, Company CAGE Code, Classified Mailing Address for the Outer Envelope, and Classified Mailing Address for the Inner Envelope with a Point of Contact. <br /><br />6. This source selection is conducted in accordance with (IAW) FAR Part 15, Source Selection, as supplemented by the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), Air Force Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFFARS), and the Department of Defense (DoD) Source Selection Procedures, 04 March 2011, and Air Force Mandatory Procedures 5315.3, 04 May 2011. The basis for award is as specified in Section M (Basis for Contract Award) of the RFP. The Government anticipates awarding one contract based upon the best value to the Government. The Government anticipates conducting discussions prior to awarding a contract. However, you should ensure that your proposals are complete and comply with all requirements of the RFP's Section L, Information to the Offerors. Discussions will be conducted with offerors determined to be within the competitive range. The tentative award date is NLT 28 Sep 2013 and the Government requests that the proposals remain valid until 30 Sep 2013.<br /><br />7. The Contracting Officer has initially determined that adequate price competition is anticipated for this source selection; certified cost or pricing data is not currently required. If it is determined that certified cost or pricing data is necessary, you will be asked to provide such data within 30 calendar days of the request.<br /><br />8. A few minor changes to the Government requirements and program direction throughout the RFP development process have been made. All previous discussion and exchanges of information are superseded by this formal RFP. You are cautioned to examine the RFP closely, comparing it to the previous draft versions. In addition, your continuous review of the FedBizOpps website is necessary to know of the latest information pertaining to the RFP. <br /><br />9. If you determine that the technical requirements of this RFP require clarification(s) in order to submit a responsive proposal, these questions shall be submitted in writing by 13 Nov 2012. Government responses or any amendments that may be generated will be posted within five business days.<br /><br />10. Your proposal must be received by the Government at the address contained in Section L, paragraph 2.14., not later than 3:00PM Wright Patterson AFB OH local time, on 3 Jan 2013 for all volumes. These mandatory response times are located on the "Solicitation, Offer and Award," cover page, Block 9.<br /><br />11. In accordance with FAR 15.201(f), and to ensure a fair competition and to maintain integrity in the RFP process, all questions and/or correspondence shall be in writing to the undersigned as the sole point of contact. No verbal or written communication with any Government personnel or activity other than the Contracting Officer is permitted. All contacts or briefings concerning the program by industry are no longer allowed outside of the formal source selection process. Address your correspondence to the attention of the undersigned at the above address or by email to the CRH mailbox: CRH@wpafb.af.mil.<br /><br />12.&nbsp;Offerors are requested to use the posted "CRH Offeror RFP Question Format" in submitting questions in writing to the Government.</p>

<CONTACT>Amanda Jones, Contract Specialist, Email amanda.jones2@navy.mil - Martha Scott, Email martha.scott@navy.mil
<DESC><p>On 5 March 2012, Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) released a market research Request For Information (RFI) soliciting non-proprietary information from industry on potential alternative solutions to the existing Chief of Naval Air Training (CNATRA) advanced rotary wing training pipeline. This was a market research effort to assist NAVAIR in exploring alternatives to the existing training construct to provide better long term training at a lower cost. NAVAIR thanks those industry partners who responded to the RFI with their views on long term training alternatives. It is anticipated that an industry day on this topic will be held in mid 2013. Please monitor FedBizOpps for further details as they become available.</p>
<p>[NOTE: As stated in the 5 March 2012 RFI, this market research effort does not conflict with the Request for Proposal (RFP) (N00019-10-R-0097) for the follow-on Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) contract in support of the existing fleet of TH-57 helicopters. Any procurement associated with this RFI topic will be synopsized separately on FedBizOpps.]</p>

<DESC>*The purpose of this modification notice to the subject pre-solicitation synopsis is to change the response date listed in the text below as follows:

FROM: 31 October 2012

TO: 05 November 2012



NSWC Indian Head requires labor, material, and services required to support the Gun Weapon System Repair Program (GWSRP) in removal, installation, refurbishment, Fleet Technical Assistance and Maintenance, and Modernization of various Gun Weapon System (GWS) Equipment, and Ancillary/Support Equipment under the cognizance of the GWSRP Program.  Thus, the expected contract vehicle referenced under this synopsis shall be an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract that will extend no longer than three years (36 months), if all options are exercised, from contract award.
   It will consist of one base year plus two option years.  Task and delivery orders will be placed as both cost-plus-fixed-fee and firm-fixed-price, as appropriate.  This requirement is considered full and open.  The NAICS code is 811219.  The Size Standard is $19M.  The FSC code is J010.  This synopsis is for non-commercial services.  Proposals are being requested and the attached Data Requirements List and applicable instructions are included with this announcement.  The upcoming solicitation number will be N00174-12-R-0043, and will be issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).

The Contractors support shall be in accordance with applicable Technical Repair Standards (TRS), Engineering Drawings and Standards, technical guidance and instruction identified at time of tasking to support specific Fleet Requirements.
 This will be coordinated by the GWSRP Program Manager (PM) or designee, and in their absence, the In-Service Engineering Agents (ISEA), Ship Support Activity (SSA) or Regional Maintenance Centers (RMC) acting on the behalf of GWSRP.  

The Government intends to make a single award resulting from the solicitation to the responsible offeror whose submissions, which comply with the instructions and conform to the solicitation, will be the most advantageous BEST VALUE to the Government.  Best value will be determined based on an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors for award.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate the offers: (a) technical capability of the items and services offered to meet the minimum needs of the Government based on examination of technical approach narrative, relevant corporate experience, equipment, and personnel resources; (b) Past Performance (see FAR 52.212-1(b)(10)); and (c) Cost.
  These factors are of equal importance.   All non-priced factors, when combined, are approximately equal to Cost in importance.  However, Cost becomes more of a deciding factor of importance when offerors receive similar ratings for the other factors.  General statements, that the offeror can or will comply with the requirements, that standard procedures will be used, that well known techniques will be used, or that paraphrases the RFQs specifications in whole or in part, will not constitute compliance with the mandatory requirements concerning the content of the technical proposal.

Copies of solicitation N00174-12-R-0043 will NOT be emailed, faxed, mailed or provided in person.  These types of requests WILL NOT BE ACKNOWLEDGED.
  This synopsis is being posted to both Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.eps.gov and Navy Electronic Commerce On-Line (NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopses and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by Naval Sea Systems Command.  NOTE:  Offerors are ineligible for award unless registered in DODs Central Contractor Registration Database which has now been integrated with the System for Award Management (SAM).  Information regarding registration and annual confirmation requirements is available at 1-866-606-8220 and http://www.sam.gov.

Any resultant contract will be DO Rated under the Defense Priorities and Allocations system (DPAS).
  

The deadline to respond to this synopsis is 05 November 2012. 

The Contract Specialist must receive any and all questions concerning the RFP no later than 5 business days before the response date of this solicitation.  No questions will be accepted after the close of the solicitation.  Offers and inquiries may be submitted via electronic mail to edward.rogan@navy.mil or mailed to the attention of Eddie Rogan, Code A22P at NSWC Indian Head  Picatinny Detach, Building 61, Code A22P, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000.

It is the REGISTRANTS responsibility to periodically check the FedBizOpps or NECO.

<a href="mailto:charles.hoyes@navy.mil">charles.hoyes@navy.mil</a>
<DESC>The NAVSUP Fleet Logistics Center Norfolk, Philadelphia, PA office is seeking information for potential sources of expertise in the logistics support services necessary to assist Naval Weapons System Support (NAVWSS) in ensuring that the new ERP systems are effectively implemented, corrected defects are validated, and failed IDOCS (intermediate documents) are maintained at an acceptable level. 

This is a SOURCES SOUGHT TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION to determine the availability and technical capability of small businesses to provide the required products and/or services and plan to hire and maintain sufficient qualified staff. Additionally, this Sources Sought notice is being published with the intent to promote competition.
 Suggestions from industry regarding how competition may best be achieved are requested. All such suggestions will be considered; however, the Government reserves the right to solicit for the required services in a manner of its own choosing in accordance with the applicable procurement regulations. The anticipated place of performance and on-site/off-site support requirements is as follows:

Place of Performance:
Naval Supply Systems Command  Weapons Systems Support
700 Robbins Avenue  Building 1
Philadelphia, PA 19111

5450 Carlisle Pike  Building 311
Mechanicsburg, PA 17055
Anticipated Period of Performance:  28 March 2013  27 September 2013 and two 6-month options.
DISCLAIMER
THIS SOURCES SOUGHT IS FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.
 THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION AND SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. RESPONSES IN ANY FORM ARE NOT OFFERS AND THE GOVERNMENT IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO AWARD A CONTRACT AS A RESULT OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. NO FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE TO PAY FOR PREPARATION OF RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. ANY INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY RESPONDENTS TO THIS TECHNICAL
DESCRIPTION IS STRICTLY VOLUNTARY.

PROGRAM BACKGROUND
The NAVSUP WSS has recently implemented a new and complex Enterprise Resource Planning System (ERP) throughout its organization. This new system has completely changed the framework of the Navys information technology system. The system is designed to incorporate the latest commercial technology into the way the Navy conducts its supply and financial operations.
 The end result will be a streamlined system that is less costly to run and more efficient in the management of the NAVYs inventory assets. Due to the complexity of the Navy logistics operations, the Navy ERP Program has evolved into a very unique system with little or no comparison to the private sector.

As with any new system of this magnitude there are several problems that need to be addressed. Principal among these problems are the many documents that fail to successfully process through the new system. These documents fail for a variety of reasons and must be corrected and successfully processed back into the system. This is a critical step in the process and if not properly completed the entire system will be rendered ineffective.
 The failed documents were an expected outcome of the introduction of this new system and a process to analyze causes of these failures and to identify solutions was implemented. In the interim, the failed documents needed correction.

Services associated with this requirement are currently being procured via task order N00189-12-F-Z439 under contract GS-23F-0076K with GENERAL DYNAMICS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY and previously through task order(s) under contract N00421-08-D-0013 with the same. The current contract type is Firm Fixed Price.

The attached draft statement of work provides additional information about the required tasking. It is requested that, in its response to the Sources Sought, a vendor identify whether it has the capability to perform under all of the tasking or only specific portions of it.
 Also, if the vendor has any questions about the structure of the statement of work, please also identify those in the response.

ELIGIBILITY
The applicable NAICS code for this requirement is 541330 and the size standard is $14M. The Product Service Code (PSC) is R706.
SUBMISSION DETAILS
Interested businesses should submit a brief capabilities statement package of no more than ten 8.5" x 11" pages (font no smaller than 10 point) demonstrating ability to perform the services listed in this Technical Description. All responses shall include Company Name, Company Address, Company Business Size and Points-of-Contact information including name, phone number, fax number and e-mail address.

Responses to this Sources Sought shall be submitted electronically by email to Charles Hoyes, Contract Specialist, at charles.hoyes@navy.mil .
 Responses shall be received no later than 1600 Eastern Time on 26 Oct 2012.
Classified material SHALL NOT be submitted. Please submit all questions to the Contract Specialist via email or alternatively at 717-605-2024. No phone or email solicitations regarding the status of the request for proposal will be accepted prior to its release.

Modification Information:
This is not a solicitation; the Government is not seeking offers at this time.  The Government is only examining the market place and the small business market in relation to this effort.  Services were performed via task order(s) under contract N00421-08-D-0013 task order 0265, this is not a re-compete of that entire contract.  There is no information as to the status of the entire contract N00421-08-D-0013 and is not part of this requirement.
  This potential requirement is just for the services outlined in the draft Statement of Work which was attached to the Source Sought notice.

It is anticipated that the solicitation will be published before the end of this calendar year.  The attached Draft PWS includes all performance and deliverable requirements as currently performed.  There will be no conference calls or discussions at this time.  It has not been determined whether this requirement will be set aside for small business.

The workload estimates for the base period of this requirement (28 March 2013 through 27 September 2013) include the following labor categories.  This information is provided for whatever purpose the contractor may use it; however, the Government expressly disclaims responsibility for estimates accuracy in connection with any submission made of the resultant order.

Labor Category:  Hours

Senior Logistician I:  175
Logistician I:  17,100
Logistician II:  15,070
Senior Financial Analyst:  92
Technical Admin Support V:  480

It is anticipated that Option Period I will have a reduced workload estimate when compared to the Base Period as will Option Period II when compared to Option Period I although a firm estimate has not been established at this time.

There was an error in the Draft PWS period of performance whereas Option II was listed as running through September 2015.
  This is incorrect, the based period is 6 months and there are two six month option periods.

Period of Performance:
Base Period:  28 March 2013 through 27 September 2013
Option I:  28 September 2013 through 27 March 2014
Option II:  28 March 2014 through 27 September 2014

<DESC>Listed below are all questions and answers in regards to the RFI.<br /><br />1. Question: I understand this is only an RFI but I was hoping you could tell me if this requirement has an incumbent Contract that has performed these or similar requirements in the past? if so, could you provide the Contract #, Contractor, Expiration date and value?<br /><br />Answer: This is a new requirement.<br /><br />2. Question: For RFI1066205120, Professional and Expert Support Services, is DoS looking for contract management support to include skills that a typical 1102 would possess?<br /><br />Answer: No. This requirement is not for contract management support.<br /><br />3. Question: The RFI details various position level (e.g., Program Analyst - levels 1-5, and junior, mid, and senior level experts among the other categories. Is there any clear mapping of these various levels against expected GS pay scale levels?<br /><br />Answer: No, not a direct mapping. While it is convenient to think in terms of GS to Contractor mapping for labor rates and descriptions, pricing, experience, and seniority, it is important to distinguish the two types of resources (Government and contractor). The working conditions and activities will be similar for Government and contractor resources will be similar, but the responsibilities vary significantly. Contractors can participate in key support activities, but responsibility for key decisions, negotiations, and other Inherently Governmental functions (IGF) is retained exclusively by Government personnel. <br /><br />4. Question: In the discussion on pricing requirements, paragraph #4. Trade-offs, references the "total composite price per labor category." Can you confirm this is the same as a fully burdened rate?<br /><br />Answer: Yes, total composite price is the same as fully burdened rate. Other terms used for the fully burdened rate include fully loaded rate, invoice rate, and bill rate, among others. It is the final rate after salary, direct labor overhead (DLO), material handling rate (M&amp;H), general and administrative rate (G&amp;A), fee and/or profit have all been applied. The composite rate, when multiplied with the hours worked in each labor category, shall equal the proposal cost, and monthly invoice total. <br /><br />5. Question: In the illustrative rates shown, is the "composite overhead" inclusive of fringe benefits, overhead, and G&amp;A costs?<br /><br />Answer: Yes<br /><br />6. Question: Are the illustrative rates for the referenced GS levels meant to be prescriptive? In other words, must we bill someone at a GS-12 level at $50.52/hour? If not, are there specific rate targets the government has? Or are there existing rates off which the government is looking to achieve material savings?<br /><br />Answer: Illustrative rates are not prescriptive. They are based on midpoints from the standard GS salary table to provide examples of the targets CSO has set for labor increases and overhead savings. Ultimately, contractors responding to the RFP, which will follow this RFI, will be evaluated on a comparative basis. The Government is seeking to maximize limited available financial resources by seeking deeply discounted overhead rates, and eliminating the costs of overhead functions typically carried by the performing contractor. As CSO will be supporting HR identification and placement functions, office and building support, IT and desktop services support, Visa processing, travel coordination, security processing, only a small subset of typical overhead functions and costs should remain. Contractors will need to develop or retain the ability to prepare properly formatted invoices, and carry the appropriate Defense Base Act (DBA) insurance for overseas travelers.<br /><br />7. Question: The government posted this RFI on October 3, 2012, which stated that all questions must be submitted no later than ten (10) working days prior to the due date of this notice, which is October 15, 2012. However, the government only provided seven (7) working days for Q&amp;A and response. Will the government extend the response date of the RFI?<br /><br />Answer: Yes, the response due date has been extended until October 23, 2012, at 3:00 P.M.<br /><br />8. Question: For personnel on travel, how will post differential be billed or handled within the target rates provided?<br /><br />Answer: Post differential, where applicable, will be handled as a separate line item, and invoiced separately.<br /><br />9. Question: The government states that it performs tasks associated with personnel and human resources and virtually every aspect of engaging its manpower. Does the government expect for vendors to incur costs and pay for benefits and time off within this rate structure?<br /><br />Answer: Yes. All normal costs for Direct Labor Overhead (benefits, sick time, time off) are to be accommodated within the rate structure.<br /><br />10. Question: Will surge and "on-call" support requirements be segregated into a different Contract Line Item (CLIN) structure?<br /><br />Answer: Not necessarily. If you see benefits in having a separate structure, please document your assumptions in response to the RFI.<br /><br />11. Question: The government specifies that, "it anticipates awarding a single contract from the solicitation to MOBIS firms." Does the government intend to procure these services under GSA's MOBIS Schedule 874?<br /><br />Answer: No. This is a separate full and open competition, not associated with current GSA schedules. The MOBIS reference was included in error.<br /><br />12. Question: The RFI's "Delivery or Performance-Period Requirements" section states that "CSO anticipates awarding a single contract from the solicitation to MOBIS firms." MOBIS is a GSA contracting vehicle that contains pre-approved fixed hourly rates for services by labor category. Therefore, MOBIS supports time-and-materials (T&amp;M) and fixed-price labor-hour (FPLH) contracts built up using GSA-approved labor categories and rates that may or may not align with the categories or targeted rates listed in the RFI. Could the Government please clarify if it plans to use MOBIS for this procurement, and if so, clarify how the target hourly rates correspond to contractors' pre-approved MOBIS schedules.<br /><br />Answer: MOBIS language was included in the RFI in error.<br /><br />13. Question: Since the government breaks down illustrative Unloaded and Composite Bill Rates, please specify how many contractor personnel are anticipated within each illustrative GS Labor Category? (i.e.: GS-12 - "25 personnel", GS-13 - "10 personnel", etc.) <br /><br />Answer: Additional information on pricing proposal preparation shall be disseminated in the RFP. Please document your assumptions about the number of FTE available in your RFI response or use 10 FTE per labor category to facilitate proposal evaluation.<br /><br />14. Question: The government is asking contract firms to, "waive or virtually discount all fees, general and administrative costs, and contribution to overhead normally associated with federal contracting." Is it the government's intent that CSO contractor personnel under this task order will work without benefits?<br /><br />Answer: No. CSO greatly values its Government and contractor resources, and fully anticipates the composite bill rate will include reasonable benefits. The target of the RFI is to reduce corporate overhead, fee, profit, and G &amp; A.<br /><br />15. Question: Please specify how each of the six categories in contract requirements (i.e.: Program Analyst 1,2,3,4, and 5, Junior, Mid-level, and Senior experts) relate to the illustrative GS Labor categories.<br /><br />Answer: There is no direct correspondence between the six categories in the contract requirements and the illustrative GS labor categories (see answer to Question 3 above).<br /><br />16. Question: The objective states, "A critical assumption in this plan is that personnel contracted by CSO are generally well known professionals in their field that CSO has found or dealt with previously." Does the government anticipate awarding a firm-fixed price "personal services" contract in accordance with FAR Part 37.104?<br /><br />Answer: Yes, is considered to be firm-fixed-price but will not be a personal services contract.<br /><br />17. Question: How does the government plan to reimburse the contractor for travel expenses, Defense Base Act (DBA) insurance, etc.?<br /><br />Answer: Contractors should bill the Government for travel expenses as Other Direct Costs.<br /><br />18. Question: The RFI states under instructions, "The pricing schedules must detail indirect pools and follow the format specified in DCAAP 7641.90." Will the government consider a response to this RFI nonresponsive provided a vendor takes exception in providing indirect/pricing data under the provisions of FAR 52.215-20(a)(ii)?<br /><br />Answer: Yes. The goal of this acquisition is to target the specific information related to indirect rates, typically considered cost or pricing data.<br /><br />19. Question: Under Contract Requirements, Capability or performance, it states, "The selected offeror must demonstrate the capability to provide professional expert support services on an "on-call" basis for both short-term and long-term deployment assignments to CSO." However, GSA specifically states that an agency cannot utilize the MOBIS schedule to fill short/surge and/or long-term agency staffing shortfalls. Is a particular GSA Schedule anticipated for this procurement?<br /><br />Answer: MOBIS references in this RFI were included in error.<br /><br />20. Question: Does the government anticipate a Performance-Based Statement of Work for this acquisition?<br /><br />Answer: No.<br /><br />21. Question: What is the projected value and years of service of the anticipated contract award?<br /><br />Answer: . The projected CSO budget has been severely cut from $80 million per year, to less than half that value for FY2013. CSO anticipates using Government personnel, Personal Services Contractors (PSCs), While Actually Employed (WAE) resources, and contractor personnel in the optimal mix to meet Bureau requirements. This requirement is for contractor personnel and should range from 10 to 20 FTE in the first year, although operational conditions may change this estimate, The estimated years for services is a base year and four option years.<br /><br />22. Question: The RFI under Objectives states "The costs associated with finding new personnel for CSO shall only be billed once in the first year of service." Is it the government's intent to develop a CLIN for this service on a cost-reimbursable basis? Please provide a detailed description of what expenses the government intends to reimburse the contractor.<br /><br />Answer: Typical executive search finder's fees will be a separate CLIN. The concept here is that the HR requirements are so few and far between that it will be more effective to incur head hunter services, if CSO has not identified the specific resource it needs vs. having access to corporate HR services on overhead.<br /><br />23. Question: Is overtime anticipated under this requirement? If so, how will it be billed or charged to the government within the anticipated rate structure?<br /><br />Answer: Bill rates shall be calculated without overtime. Overtime, where authorized, will be filled at the negotiated rate, up to 60 hours per week.<br /><br />24. Question: The RFI's "Trade Off" section that discusses current and target hourly rates does not appear to take into account the difference between how contractors load indirect rates on short-term consultants compared to long-term staff. For example, contractors generally load long-term staff with fringe benefits, where they may not load fringe onto consultants providing short-term technical assistance. Could the Government please clarify if it has a different set of fully-loaded "Composite Bill Rates" for full-time personnel, as the current and target rates shown in the RFI appear to only represent short-term consultants. If the Government does have a full-time table, could it share these figures with offerors?<br /><br />Answer: A table of comparative rates has not been established by the Government. Period of performance (POP) for specific contractor resources will be communicated at the time of task order execution. POP may vary from 1-2 weeks, to a year for particular resources. For pricing purposes, assume all contractor resources are short term (6 months or less) and document your assumptions related to longer, or shorter, periods of performance.<br /><br />25. Question: The RFI's "Trade Off" section contains a table that shows current and target hourly rates. Each table refers to a "composite overhead." Different contractors build up indirect rates differently based on their Negotiated Indirect Cost Rate Agreements (NICRAs) with their cognizant agencies. For example, some firms have different overhead rates for home office vs. client-site employees, while others do not take overhead but G&amp;A only on short-term staff. Could the Government please clarify what the "composite overhead" figure includes. Alternatively, does the Government mean "composite indirect rate" instead of "composite overhead"?<br /><br />Answer: As stated in the RFI, "Bidders should be prepared to waive or discount virtually all fees, general and administrative costs, and contribution to overhead normally associated with federal contracting". The Government fully understands that variations exist in the preparation of indirect rate tables, which is why that information is being requested in this RFI so an equitable comparison and evaluation can be made.<br /><br />26. Question: As a company working OCONUS, we assume post differential is not included in the target rates. How will the USG address post differential rates in a FFP contract?<br /><br />Answer: Appropriate post differential will be handled as a separate line item, and invoiced separately.<br /><br />27. Question: Will the government consider a competitive contract award as to not incur the fees associated with the MOBIS Schedule?<br /><br />Answer: The reference to MOBIS in the RFI was in error.<br /><br />28. Question: What are the destinations, durations and frequencies of travel for these positions?<br /><br />Answer: TBD as Department needs dictate. CSO operates in diverse areas across the globe.<br /><br />29. Question: Will the USG dictate the number of personnel required for each task order?<br /><br />Answer: Yes. Details will be enumerated at time of task order award.<br /><br />30. Question: The "critical assumptions" paragraph in the RFI insinuates that DoS has the majority of contractor personnel identified for this opportunity. Lower than industry standard rates will put these individuals at risk. How did the government determine their target base rates?<br /><br />Answer: The Government disagrees with the assertion about placing "individuals at risk". Please document your assumptions about risk in your response to the RFI.<br />&nbsp;

<DESC>**19 OCT 2012 - AMENDMENT TO THE SPECIAL OPERATIONS FORCES AVIATION SYSTEM TRAINER-ENHANCEMENTS (SOFAST-E) SOLICITATION
<p>A critical system failure which occurred last week with the Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) has been preventing accessibility to the draft documentation originally posted for this solicitation. This Amendment is to notify industry that this information will be re-posted directly through FedBizOpps and will be available for download.</p>
<p>Additionally, this notice is intended to inform industry of the Government's change in strategy for disseminating the Government Furnished Information (GFI) which will be made available solely for proposal preparations purposes. Due to the numerous file formats of the documentation, FedBizOpps is unable to accommodate our request. As a result, we will be providing DVD compilations of the available GFI to those interested parties that comply with, and submit the signed Distribution Agreement (DA) (Attachment 14) found in the solicitation. Interested parties must provide a formal request for the GFI via email along with the signed DA to the identified Government Point of Contact (POC). This request, at a minimum, must include the company's full name, Cage Code, DUNS number, physical address and POC (must be the same as the signatory on the Distribution Agreement). The POC must provide current contact information (email and phone number). For those parties who have already provided signed DAs, please contact the Government POC via email to set up the delivery method most suitable. For those parties able to pick up this GFI in person, you must coordinate with the Government POC to arrange a time/day for pick-up at the appropriate PEO STRI location in Orlando, Florida.</p>
<p>The new cut off for parties interested in utilizing this GFI for proposal preparation is 23 October 2012. Again, please provide your signed DA along with an email identifying the aforementioned information.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER: This notice does not constitute an invitation for bids or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not a commitment by the U.S. Government to procure subject products or services nor will the Government reimburse any parties for costs associated with this request.</p>
<p>The GFI available for proposal preparations will be provided by the Government as a courtesy and is made available only for those approved Offerors that wish to utilize it for proposal assistance. The Government will not guarantee that the data made available represents the most recent version or that it conveys a complete system, subsystem or architecture. Offerors shall not assume or expect that any data provided in the library constitutes technical direction on the part of the Government This information is not intended to be part of the Governments RFP and is provided only for the purpose of assisting Offerors in gaining a better understanding from a technical perspective. The Government will not accept responsibility for any errors or misleading assumptions proposed by the Offerors from information derived from this GFI proposal preparation library.
