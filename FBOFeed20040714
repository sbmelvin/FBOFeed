<DESC>The Health Resources & Services Administration (HRSA) intends to negotiate - on a sole source basis -- with National Kidney Foundation (NKF) of New York – National Donor Family Council (NDFC), New York, New York.  

The purpose of this acquisition is to assist the Division of Transplantation (DoT), Special Programs Bureau with the planning and implementation of meeting services and activities related to the ninth National Donor Recognition Ceremony and Workshops. 

NKF/NDFC is an expert in this field and their services are critical to the performance of this requirement.
The Contractor has spent a considerable amount of effort in developing dynamic and influential affiliations between donor families and assists the healthcare professionals who work most closely with these families.  Any other source would have to duplicate a substantial array of current and previous efforts to accomplish the same objectives.  This would cause substantial duplication of cost, which would not be expected to be recovered through competition.  Therefore, NKF/NDFC is determined to be the only responsible source under the authority found in 41 USC 253(i), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(a) (2).  
This is not a solicitation, but a notification of our intent to contract.  A justification for other than full and open competition (JOFOC) is on file. 

Cite solicitation #04-N234-5019 HA when corresponding.  

WE WILL RESPOND TO WRITTEN CORRESPONDENCE ONLY.

<DESC>Jones Lang LaSalle Privatization Support Contractor, acting on behalf of the Air Force Center for Environmental Excellence (AFCEE), the Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC), and the Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) anticipates the release of its Request for Proposal for the Privatization of Military Family Housing at Eglin Air Force Base and Hurlburt Field, Florida on or about 6 August 2004.  Jones Lang LaSalle intends to employ a two-step RFP process.  In the first step, each prospective offeror (or offeror team) will submit written evidence of its qualifications, experience, references, access to financial resources and a brief summary of its approach to the Eglin AFB and Hurlburt Field project.  Jones Lang LaSalle, with Air Force concurrence, will pre-qualify those offerors that satisfactorily demonstrate their financial and technical capability and understanding of the requirements of the Eglin AFB and Hurlburt Field project.  In the second step, up to five qualified offerors will be invited to submit fully specified technical and financial proposals.  Jones Lang LaSalle will evaluate proposals on the basis of evaluation criteria stated in the RFP and recommend a Successful Offeror (SO) to the Air Force.  The Eglin AFB and Hurlburt Field Housing Privatization Project will be initiated with a real estate transaction. The objective of the transaction is to provide quality homes for Military Families and management of a 2,155-unit housing community for a period of at least 50 years. The Government will lease the land. The existing 2,739 housing units, secondary associated utility and infrastructure systems, and other improvements will be conveyed to the SO.  The Government may subsidize the project's financing to the degree necessary to enter into an agreement with the successful private offeror.  The SO will contribute cash equity, will obtain private sector debt, and will be responsible for managing and operating the Eglin AFB and Hurlburt Field family housing inventory.  Except in very limited respects, and subject to certain specific cash-reserve requirements, the SO will be entitled to a portion of the project's operating cash flow as specified in the RFP and in the agreements that will be executed after selection of the SO.  This transaction is not subject to requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. The Statement of Need is available at http://www.jllpsc.com.

<CONTACT>Patricia Sullivan, Contracting officer (781-377-3956
<DESC>Notification of Contract Action (NOCA).  This FEDBIZOPS announcement constitutes a NOCA for proposed contract modification award to MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates (MDA).  ESC/SRK intends to award a modification to the existing Eagle Vision/RADARSAT 2 contract to modify the RADARSAT 2 satellite bus in support of the RADARSAT Tandem Topographic Mission.  This modification will design, build and test two omni-directional C-band antennas on RADARSAT 2 for frequency synchronization between RADARSAT 2 and the Tandem satellite. <br><br> The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1 entitled "Only one source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."  Authorization to do this is contained under 10 U.S.C. 2304-(c ) (1).  MDA is the sole proprietor of the license to develop, market and produce the downlink reception and processing algorithms and systems for the RADARSAT 2 and Tandem satellites, and is therefore the only contractor able to perform the requested service.  This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal, nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach, nor should it be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Notes 22 and 26 apply.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intend to negotiate on a sole source basis with the University of Rochester, Dr. S.R.S. Rao Produri to perform a professional service contract for Linear Unbiased Prediction For Small Domains.  The PSC is a continuation of previous research on small domain estimators; therefore, this announcement is being issued for informational purposes only.  This acquisition is being processed under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures

BACKGROUND INFORMATION

Several approaches for small domain estimation employing data collected in large and small scale surveys have been proposed and described in statistical literature. A substantial body of research on Bayesian approaches, including empirical Bayes and hierarchical Bayesian models, now exists. The research to be conducted under this PSC differs from other ongoing research in that it involves extensions of classical random-effects models and the attending estimation theory with a special focus on evaluating the estimators for individual small domains.  Thus, the research emphasis is on how well a small domain estimator performs in each instance where an estimate is needed and not on how well an estimator performs on average overall.

This PSC is a continuation of previous research on small domain estimators in which the following features of Best Linear Unbiased Predictors (BLUP’s) and Empirical BLUP’s (or EBLUP’s) were investigated:

1.	Unconditional biases and mean-square-errors (MSE's) of the BLUPs and EBLUPs and their expected values.  Comparison of these MSEs with the variance of the sample mean.

2.	Expected values of the conditional biases and MSE's of the BLUPs and EBLUPs.


3.	Conditional and unconditional biases and MSEs of the BLUPs and EBLUPs for estimating the mean of a small domain.

Both the cases of equal and unequal sample sizes for small domains were considered.  It is essential to note that some of the results on the biases and MSEs were obtained through ad hoc approximations which require further study.


OBJECTIVES

As discussed above, in the completed research, biases and MSEs of the BLUPs and EBLUPs were examined through approximations to their expressions.  Further examination of the biases and MSEs will be conducted under this PSC.

The biases and MSEs of the BLUPs and EBLUPs for the small domain means will be examined for unequal sample sizes and some consideration will be given to the randomness of the number of sample units for a small domain.  This is important since the sample sizes for the small domains are usually random and unequal.

The unconditional MSE of the BLUP and the average of the unconditional MSEs of the EBLUPs have been examined in the literature.  The conditional and unconditional biases and MSEs of the EBLUPs will be examined.  This topic is of central importance since the mean of each small domain must be estimated.

Estimation of the small domain means can be improved through the regression-type of models.  Regression models for BLUP and EBLUP estimators will be proposed and studied.  This part of the research will bring out the additional benefits of using auxiliary information for the BLUPs and EBLUPs of small domain means.



SCOPE OF WORK

To achieve the above objectives, the following tasks will be carried out in collaboration with the Project Officer:

(1) The approximations to the biases and MSEs of the BLUPs and EBLUPs will be evaluated by considering additional terms in the respective expressions.

(2) The conditional and unconditional biases and MSEs of the BLUPs and EBLUPs for the individual small domain means for the case of unequal sample sizes will be examined.  The biases and MSEs of the estimators and the ratios of the squared biases to the MSEs will be examined for different patterns of the sample sizes.

(3) Regression type of estimators and the corresponding BLUPs and EBLUPs for small domains will be suggested, and their properties will be evaluated.  The average biases and MSEs of the estimators will be examined. Further, biases and MSEs of the estimators for the individual means will be evaluated

To be considered qualified, sources must submit a capabilities statement which demonstrates in writing their ability to meet the following requirements:

1.	Provide detailed and extensive knowledge of linear model theory covering conditional and unconditional biases and MSE’s of BLUPs and EBLUPs and mixed model estimators.
2.	Formulate and solve problems in small domain estimation arising in the context of data analysis for public health surveys.
3.	Develop design-based, model-based and model-assisted estimation strategies for use with data from national sample surveys.

All of the above requirements should be supported by a record of completed and funded research projects. Evidence of the required formal theoretical justification for that work can be provided by citation of books, articles in learned journals and research reports on the subjects of interest.

Qualified organizations are encouraged to submit a capabilities statement which addresses the requirements and contains material in sufficient detail to allow the CDC to determine if the party can perform this requirement. Capabilities are to be received in the contracting office no later than fifteen (15) days from the date of this announcement. Submit written information to:  Margaret Mooney, MS-P05, Reference: MLM000HCS13-2004-10275, CDC/PGO/AAFB, 626 Cochrans Mill Road, PO Box 18070, Pittsburgh, PA  15236-0070 or responses may be submitted electronically to Margaret Mooney at zia3@cdc.gov 

The intent of this synopsis is to determine whether alternative sources exist. Information received will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All responsible sources may submit a response, which shall be considered by the Agency.  If any responses are submitted in response to this presolicitation notice and the agency determines to compete this requirement, an RFQ will be issued solely to the responders of this notice.  A subsequent presolicitation notice will not be issued.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Instron Corporation, of Canton, Massachusetts, for acquisition of one (1) each, Video Extensometer System, which includes a CCD Video Camera with a lens providing a Field of View no greater then 60 mm, Image Processing Electronics, Lighting Fixture, Marker Pens and Gauge Length Template, Mounting Kit, Signal Conditioning Card, and On-Site installation and calibration.  The Video Extensometer System will be used by the Electronics and Electrical Engineering Laboratory at NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland.

*****Sole source determination is based on the need for the Video Extensometer to be electronically compatible with Instron’s Model 4482 Universal Testing System (UTS), which is currently in the laboratory and running Instron’s Series IX Software package.  Instron’s 4482 UTM is capable of measuring mechanical properties of a wide range of materials.  A video extensometer that is not interoperable with the 4482 and the Series IX software package would lead to that software producing erroneous results, and would require an extensive amount of post processing of data and additional software code development.  Instron Corporation is the only known vendor for the required Video Extensometer.

*****Delivery is required within 90 days or less after receipt of order (ARO) and shall be made FOB destination.

*** FOB Destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.  The contractor shall deliver all line items to NIST, Building 301, Shipping and Receiving, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-0001. ***

The PCC shall provide the selected CoEs with a Program Development and Implementation Manual, a pre-and post-survey for the health professional students (HPS),and the In Touch with Teens curriculum developed by the Los Angeles Commission on Assaults Against Women (LACAAW).  Three hours of curriculum training on teen dating violence prevention shall be provided by the PCC.  The PCC shall set up an evaluation plan for the program to include a draft of the pre and post program evaluation survey and any other evaluation tools proposed.  The purpose of the evaluation shall be to determine if the program has any effect on the knowledge and attitude of HPSs regarding the topic of relationship violence, as well as working with adolescents.  The evaluation shall measure the effect of the program on career goals of HPSs and include questions to determine what about the program was most influential for the HPSs.  The PCC shall develop a database, preferable using Access to track both contact information of the HPSs and data collected through the survey for evaluation.  The PCC shall collect all data from the selected CoEs, enter it in the database, follow-up on missing data, analyze the data and submit a written report to OWH and the selected CoEs.  The PCC shall prepare a technical paper describing purpose, methods, results and conclusion of the evaluation and the paper shall be written for potential submission to an appropriate journal to be determined by the OWH.  UCLA has been justified in accordance with FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b)(1) as a sole source.  In 2003 UCLA was competitively awarded a contract for negotiation skill building and conducted a mini evaluation that serves as the template for this proposed evaluation.  UCLA’s direct experience in designing this program and implementing it, designing an evaluation and conducting the evaluation gives it the unique expertise to act as the PCC.  Award shall be fixed price in accordance with FAR Subpart 13  Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

<DESC>The Office of Justice Programs (OJP), Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) attends to award on a sole source basis a purchase order to Howard Snyder, Ph.D., 1616 Randolph Lane, Verona, PA 15147.  In accordance with the Prison Rape Elimination Act of 203 (P.L. 108-79), BJS is implementing a program to compile statistics on the incidence and prevalence of sexual assault in jails, prisons, and juvenile facilities.   BJS has extensive experience collecting data from and within jails and prisons, however, there is limited in-house experience regarding the collection of data from and within the juvenile justice correctional system.  Outside expertise is needed in order to properly address the concerns regarding confidentiality, consent, facility classification, juvenile justice terminology, and other issues which may arise in the collection of data from youth.  Dr. Howard Snyder,is the Director of Systems Research for the National Center for Juvenile Justice (NCJJ). The Systems Research Division (SRD) provides policymakers, practitioners, the media, and the public with statistical information on child victims and offenders, as well as the entire juvenile justice system. Dr. Snyder has worked extensively with the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) to improve the quality, accuracy, and utility of national data on juvenile justice. Dr. Snyder is an ideal candidate to aid BJS in developing a national data collection on the sexual assault of juveniles in correctional placement. He was actively involved in the design and development of the Census of Juveniles in Residential Placement (CJRP) and the Juvenile Residential Facility Census (JRFC) conducted by OJJDP. He is also very familiar with the development and implementation of OJJDP’s new Survey of Youth in Residential Placement (SYRP), which interviewed about 10,000 youth in residential placement regarding their background, delinquency, and facility experiences, including a brief section on sexual assault.  Dr. Snyder’s expertise is of importance because BJS is under a mandate by Congress to provide estimates of sexual assault within juvenile correctional facilities as soon as possible. His knowledge of the juvenile justice system and juvenile delinquents is the ideal resource to tap to expedite the development and implementation of this data collection.  This is not a request for quotation.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Neurological Disorders and Stroke, Division of Intramural Research (DIR), Light Imaging Facility (LIF), plans to procure a megapixel EMCCD camera from Perkin Elmer LAS Inc, 710 Bridgeport Ave, Shelton, CT 06484.  The LIF is an institute-wide facility created to provide scientists in the DIR with access to state-of-the-art light imaging equipment which currently has scientists from many laboratories using the equipment for ongoing research.  One of the four Government owned laser scanning confocal microscopes (LSM) is an Ultraview RS laser confocal microscope purchased from Perkin Elmer in 2003 which incorporates an Orca ER camera that lacks the sensitivity and speed needed for optimal imaging of fluorescence in living specimens.  The megapixel EMCCD camera has improved sensitivity and speed and has been customized by Perkin Elmer for use with the Ultraview RS confocal system, allowing coordinated control of camera and other elements of the system (spinning disk, acousto-optical filters, shutters).  Installation of the camera is included and can only be performed by technicians from Perkin Elmer in order not to void current warranties and maintenance agreements.  This item is commercial as defined in FAR Part 2, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR 13.5. This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement including installation without voiding current warranties it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  This procurement is in the aggregate and the Government will not consider any proposals offering just the camera without installation.  An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EDT, on July 21, 2004.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov .  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect call will be accepted.  NIACS 334516, Size Standard 500.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION 1-04 - CONTRACTOR SUPPORT: OPERATIONAL CONCEPT DEVELOPMENT AND EXPERIMENTATION

1.0	Description

1.1	Allied Command Transformation (ACT) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) announcement on behalf of the Deputy Assistant Chief of Staff Joint Experimentation, Exercises, and Assessment (DACOS JEEA). 
1.2	This Is A Request For Information (RFI) only. The intent is to only identify potential Vendors for on-site Contractor support in building an operational concept development and experimentation (CD&E) program for NATO.
1.3	This RFI DOES NOT constitute a current Request for Proposal (RFP) nor a promise to issue a future RFP. ACT is not seeking proposals at this time and will not accept unsolicited proposals prior to potential release of an RFP in late January 2004. Respondees are advised that NATO will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in responding to this RFI. All costs for responding to this RFI shall be borne solely by the responding Vendor. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP when issued. 
1.4	Planning, Vendors should consider potential Contractor support to consist of 15-25 on-site personnel with short-term surge capability of 5-10 additional personnel for fiscal 2004. Contractor personnel may be further increased in fiscal 2005 and the out years. Expected specialties will include: project management, contracting support, information technology support, concept developers, experimenters, and operations research analysts. 
1.5	Any future RFP that may be released shall be listed on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website (http://www.fedbizopps.gov). Vendors are responsible for monitoring this site for additional information on this requirement.

2.0	Background 
2.1	DACOS JEEA is seeking Contractor support to help design and conduct a credible NATO-wide CD&E program, and develop metrics to identify the program’s successes and deficiencies. The design and metrics must have sufficient detail to identify opportunities to improve warfighting capability, especially relating to the NATO Response Force (NRF). This RFI seeks responses that will be used in developing and issuing a proposed RFP for Contractor services by the end of January 2004. 
2.2	The mission of ACT is to lead Alliance Transformation. Experimentation works with Concept Development to be the highly adaptive engine to accomplish this Transformation mission. Experimentation is the intellectual engine for the entire Transformation process. For a Transformation Command, experimentation equals the ammunition and fuel to the warfighter. No new concept nor capability should (or will) be moved into doctrine, interoperability work, training, capability packages, or force proposals until validated through credible experimentation. Experimentation controls the pace of Transformation. In the Transformation environment, the effectiveness of the entire process depends on delivering credible products. 
2.3	ACT provides a common NATO setting for experimental activities. ACT expects to accomplish experimentation objectives in various ways including: building experimental venues in which future-looking concepts can be validated; using existing exercises in which mature concepts can be demonstrated by NATO agencies and nations; leveraging the efforts of others such as NATO nations, coalition partners, industry, business, and academia; and by being involved in training and innovation shown by operational commanders.

3.0	Requested Information
3.1	White Paper. Vendor companies and organizations are invited to provide a white paper, of no more than 15 pages, on their operational CD&E experiences; previous demonstrations of; and capabilities to design, develop, conduct, and assess capabilities to support an experimentation program. The white papers shall be due by 1600 hours on 5 Jan 2004. Information in the white papers will be considered in developing any potential final Statement of Work requirements. Proprietary information, if any, should be minimized and clearly marked as such. Please be advised that all submissions become NATO property and will not be returned. The white papers shall be in Microsoft Word for Office 2000-compatible format, and shall not contain classified information. The white papers shall address, at a minimum, the following concepts and methods to:

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>17.  This is a combined synopsis/notice of intent for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included 
in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are not being re-quested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This requirement is being issued as a Notice of Intent under NOI4074.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 01-24.  This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is a small business set-aside.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 112930 and the Small Business Size Standard $0.75M.  The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) intends to procure Two (2) Male fpr-rs2 kockout mice and Two (2) Female fpr-rs2 knockout mice.   These Knockout mice will be procured  from Deltagen, Inc.   These mice are required to study the role of the receptor gene fpr-rs2 (FPR-L1) in inflammation and Alzheimer’s Disease.  This is a continuous study  of chemotactic and chemokine receptors and the role they  play in human disease.  During our studies we discovered that a particular receptor (FPR-L1 in humans and fpr-rs2 in mice) were receptors for amyloid-B.  This discovery has suggested that the receptor is involved in Alzheimer’s Disease.  The NIH has been working to develop a fpr-rs2 gene deleted mouse to ascertain the role this receptor plays in the disease process.  Deltagen, Inc. of San Carlos, California has developed a mouse with its fpr-rs2 gene deleted. Deltagen, Inc. is the only company that has developed the fpr-rs2 knockout mouse.  The fpr-rs2 knockout mouse will be used in studies of  1) proinflammatory responses and the expression of cytokines and chemokines; 2) the role of fpr-rs2 in affecting susceptibility to infectious diseases; and 3) the role of fpr-rs2 in the pathogenesis of disease including Alzheimer’s disease.  If the knockout mice are dead upon delivery or die within thirty (30) days of delivery through no fault of NIAID, Deltagen will replace any dead mice, if replacement mice are available.  If replacement mice are not available,  NIAID shall have no obligation to pay the fee.  The vendor  must have a PHS Approved Animal Welfare Assurance.  Delivery is three months after receipt of the purchase order.  These mice must be quarantine 8-10 weeks at the Rockville Facility.  The FOB Point shall be Destination, Rockville, Maryland, 20852. The government will award a firm fixed price purchase order to the responsible contractor.   FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors – Commercial Items; Offerors must include with their offer a completed copy of the Provision FAR 52.212.3 Offeror Representations and Certifications – Commercial Items; FAR 2.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certification – Commercial Items; FAR 52.212.4 Contract Terms and Conditions of Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-5  Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes of Executive Orders Commercial Items. (B)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.

a.	Statement of Work

Background & Need:
The task of bringing science based interventions to the field of HIV prevention has been advanced by the CDC with its innovative projects, the Replicating Effective Programs (REP) project and the Diffusion of Effective Behavioral Interventions (DEBI) project.  The REP project packages interventions with evidence of effectiveness into easy understand and use designs which can be used by any agency to deliver an intervention that has been proven to reduce behaviors associated with HIV transmission.  These packages contain all intervention materials, manuals to guide their use, and marketing materials to promote the program.

Upon completion of each REP intervention package, the DEBI project is charged with ensuring that it is used in the field.  The DEBI strategy involves providing training for trainers that can teach the intervention to various community agencies, support for those trainings, and on-going technical assistance to agency implementers who choose to deliver the intervention.  This nationwide diffusion strategy involves the work of the original curricula writers and package designers who can train other trainers to deliver the intervention, additional trainers, and coaches who can address technical assistance needs to ensure appropriate delivery of the intervention.

CDC’s Advancing HIV Prevention initiative has emphasized addressing the prevention needs of PLWH using science-based programs.  The CDC endorsed this intervention further with Program Announcement 04064 that specifically stated that CBOs that serve HIV infected populations should implement this intervention with general populations of HIV infected persons. The stature of the CDC in national and international public health influences the direction of prevention initiatives throughout the US whether they are funded by CDC (through direct or indirect methods) or by other organizations.  Community organizations and their funders are looking to the CDC to provide guidance on the implementation of proven interventions for PLWH.  This contract shall be used to procure the materials, training, and on-going technical assistance for agencies wishing to deliver the Healthy Relationships intervention.  The Healthy Relationships intervention is the only intervention for a general population of people living with HIV that has is based in science and has been proven effective.

The diffusion of the Healthy Relationships intervention addresses CDCs goal of improving HIV prevention by bringing evidence-based interventions to the field of HIV preventions.

Scope of Work:

The contractor shall manage the diffusion of the Healthy Relationships intervention for interested community and non-governmental organizations and health departments.  This diffusion effort shall include developing a Healthy Relationships training curriculum and producing training materials for training of trainers, delivering a training of trainers, training of coaches, providing Technical Assistance Guides for all coaches, managing training for community agencies, and provision of materials.  Required personnel for this project include trainers with experience in curriculum development.

Detailed Technical Requirements:
Train-the-trainer curriculum development and production of  training materials for training of trainers, and providing a training of trainers:  The contractor shall develop a train-the-trainer curriculum, and shall conduct a training of trainers with representatives from the four behavioral STD/HIV Prevention Training Centers and the focus area 2 Capacity Building Assistance Providers funded under Program Announcement 04019.  The contractor shall provide all materials for this training of trainers.  This training of trainers shall be appropriate for adult learners, and shall include a review of materials, a review of all sessions, demonstration of all intervention concepts, mock training sessions, and teach-backs at a minimum.  At the end of training, participants shall have all skills necessary to train agencies on the delivery of the Healthy Relationships intervention as evidenced by demonstration of training skills in the Healthy Relationships intervention materials.

Curriculum development for training of coaches, delivering a training of coaches, and production of a Technical Assistance Guide: The contractor shall conduct a training of coaches for the Healthy Relationships intervention.  The training shall prepare coaches to answer all technical assistance inquiries from agencies that have been trained to deliver the Healthy Relationships intervention.  The training shall be designed with adult learning principles in mind, and shall address the salient learning points of the Healthy Relationships intervention. Coaches may be selected from programs funded under Program Announcement 04019.

Provision of Materials:  The contractor shall print materials for the training of trainers, the training of coaches, and the training of implementers of the intervention.  The contractor shall ensure that at each training every participant has a copy of the intervention package which shall include an implementer’s manual, 4 video clips, a marketing video, and a risk/stress continuum banner.  The contractor must print and provide for the training up to 600 intervention kits.  The contractor shall be responsible for shipping all training materials to each training site.

A waitlist of agencies who wish to receive training on Healthy Relationships will be managed by an external contractor funded through a pre-existing task order, the Academy for Educational Development (AED).  Agencies will sign up for training by visiting www.effectiveinterventions.org, the Diffusion of Effective Behavioral Interventions (DEBI) homepage.  AED will be responsible for scheduling agencies to receive training and for cooperating with the HIV/STD Prevention Training Centers and the focus area 2 Capacity Building Assistance (CBA) providers funded through CDC Program Announcement 04019 to plan the training.  The waitlist, including a listing of all agencies who have received training will be made available to CDC staff in the Prevention Program Branch and the Capacity Building Branch.  In this way the CDC project officer will be able to monitor the list to ensure that trainings are provided appropriately, and that agencies receive training in a timely manner.

<DESC>MODIFICATION 02: The powerpoint presentation from the pre-proposal conference held on July 14, 2004, is attached. It includes responses to questions received to date. The information in the pre-proposal conference presentation, including the response to questions, is provided for clarification purposes only and does not change, supplement, or or otherwise revise the original request for quotation. In the event there is a conflict, the original RFQ shall take precedence.  ORIGINAL SYNOPSIS:  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), a bureau operating within the Department of Commerce, is interested in awarding one or more Blanket Purchase Agreements with venders capable of providing short-term, project-based specific scientific and technical support.  During government fiscal year 2003, NOAA’s headquarters acquisition office acquired over $92 million worth of supplies and services to support the mission of the Ocean Service, Marine Fisheries Service, and Research Office.  Approximately 70% of the 1,200 transactions issued in 2003 were simplified acquisitions for services and supplies that directly support NOAA programs.  A portion of these simplified acquisitions were individual agreements for short-term (i.e., 6-12 months) technical and scientific services that required specialized skills to address a diverse range of projects that support programs and NOAA’s overall mission.  The type of projects include services to collect and analyze scientific data, creating, reviewing and revising scientific and technical plans and reports, reviewing program plans, procedures and results for compliance with pre-stated goals, building and sustaining coalitions among scientific and technical experts, implementing program plans, providing litigation support, and coordinating program/project actions among Federal, state and local governments as well as industry and citizen groups.  The majority of these services require individuals with broad technical and scientific knowledge combined with detailed knowledge of NOAA’s mission, objectives and line office operating plans.  The following is a partial list of the types of labor that have previously been sought to work on short term projects:  physical oceanographer, coastal scientist, oceanographer, marine biologist, marine ecologist, environmental scientist, fishery biologist, and natural resource economist.   The level of experience can vary from junior level (graduate students) to principals and senior scientists.  NOAA’s mission, line offices and program objectives can be reviewed on its webpage: www.noaa.gov. 

PURPOSE OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT:  In order to create a more efficient process for acquiring and managing the scientific and technical support services described above, NOAA is interested in awarding one or more Blanket Purchase Agreements to small businesses holding MOBIS Contracts (SIN 874) under the GSA Federal Supply Schedule.  The first task order to be placed against the BPA is also included with this announcement.  

Small businesses holding GSA MOBIS schedule contracts (SIN 874) who are interested in being considered for award of a Blanket Purchase Agreement for the services described above should review the attached documents.  These documents include:  (1) A detailed Request For Quotation (RFQ-07_08_04); the prospective Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA 07_09_2004); and the first task order (BPA Task Order 0001).

<DESC>The purpose of this request is to collect information that will be relevant to planning NASA's future Space Communications Architecture.  The Vision for Space Exploration, which the President announced in January 2004, will require a robust, extensible communications architecture to meet the needs of expanding human presence into the universe.  The communications architecture will spring from the present legacy systems of the Deep Space Network, the Tracking Data Relay Satellite System, and Ground Systems, and will enable NASA's human, robotic, and scientific endeavors for the Nation.  At present, the Space Communications Architecture is being planned within NASA.  With this Request for Information, NASA is seeking information regarding capabilities and technologies that would enable and enhance this future communications architecture.  No procurement is planned for this request or as part of the Space Communications Architecture planning activity.  However, companies interested in describing their technology to NASA are encouraged to supply documentation in a format of their choosing.  If the company desires to give an oral presentation, the company should so indicate.   Documentation is still required to be submitted before scheduling the oral presentation.

<DESC>The Library of Congress FEDLINK Program requires accounting services to pay invoices for federal libraries who borrow from libraries that charge for lending materials.  Federal libraries that use this Interlibrary Loan (ILL) Payment Service will be participating in the Federal Library and Information Center Committee (FLICC) FEDLINK cooperative program and will establish accounts with LC/FEDLINK to pay for the charges they incur. The ILL Payment Service vendor will pay the lending libraries' certified invoices and will then bill the borrowing library's LC/FEDLINK account for reimbursement for the amount paid to the lender and for a service fee.  The vendor will provide the borrowing library with detailed reports and summaries of lender invoices paid.  This service is designed for payments, not collections.  That is, the vendor is to pay institutions that photocopy or lend materials from their collection to federal libraries; the vendor is not to collect from borrowers (individuals or institutions) fees that federal libraries themselves may charge when they photocopy or lend materials. The FEDLINK ILL fee payment service provides an efficient method for federal libraries to pay ILL fees that may be charged by lending institutions to cover the cost of photocopying or other interlibrary loan processing costs.  WRITTEN RESPONSES SHOULD INCLUDE PRICES AND TECHNICAL DATA SUFFICIENT TO DETERMINE CAPABILITY. Response shall be provided via email or fax to Vanessa Fox at vfox@loc.gov or 202-707-0485.

<DESC>PROJECT: DECK REPAIRS AND WATERPROOFING PAVEMENT, SAGAMORE HIGHWAY BRIDGE, BOURNE, MA THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District, is issuing this sources sought announcement to request submissions from companies that manufacture additives for bituminous highway paving mixtures as described. The produ ct process shall be a polymer additive which is added to a standard highway paving mix at the asphalt plant.  When placed and compacted, the in-place pavement shall be such that the void space is reduced to the point at which the pavement is considered wat erproof and a waterproofing membrane is not required, and the density is increased to the point at which potholes and rutting are minimized or totally eliminated.  Documentation of these properties shall be based on the product/process meeting the criteria  of the following tests and requirements. Test for Fatigue Rating: This test shall compare an unmodified AC 20 asphalt mix with a similar asphalt mix with the specific additive as part of the mix binder to assess fatigue resistance.  The samples shall be t ested according to AASHTO TP 8, Ã¢Â€ÂœStandard Test Method for Determining the Fatigue Life of Compacted Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) Subjected to Repeated Flexural Bending.Ã¢Â€Â  The beam fatigue testing shall be conducted at a test temperature of 25 degrees C,  a loading frequency of 5 Hertz, and a tensile strain level of 600 microstrains.  Samples shall be compacted to 7 plus or minus 1 percent air voids for testing.  Fatigue failure is defined as the number of fatigue cycles which correspond to a 50 percent re duction in the initial beam stiffness. Results shall be considered to meet criteria, that is, shall be considered to have sufficient fatigue resistance, when each sample of the modified mix demonstrates a minimum fatigue resistance of 250,000 cycles at 25 degrees C and at least three times that of the unmodified AC 20 binder mix as determined by AASHTO TP 8. Test for Rut Resistance: The object of this test shall be to evaluate the rutting characteristics of the additive modified asphalt mixture under test w heel loadings at elevated temperatures.  Two types of hot mix asphalt mixtures shall be used; one a neat AC 20 asphalt binder, and the second using the same AC 20 binder modified with the proposed additive.  The aggregate for both asphalt mixes shall be th e same. Three Marshall samples shall be prepared for each HMA per ASTM D1559.  The compaction machine and procedures used for fabricating the asphalt beams shall be according to State of Georgia DOT GDT 115 Specifications.  The loaded wheel testing shall b e performed according to Georgia DOT GDT 115.  Tests shall be performed at 40 degrees C and 60 degrees C.  Results shall be considered to meet criteria when the following values are met or exceeded: The rut depth, in inches, for the AC 20 with additive sam ple is a maximum of  half the value for the neat AC 20 sample. The following minimum rut depths for the AC 20 with additive sample, tested at 40 degrees C shall not exceed the following values: For 1000 cycles a maximum rut depth of 0.04 inches; for 8000 c ycles a maximum rut depth of 0.05 inches. The following minimum rut depths for the AC 20 with additive sample, tested at 60 degrees C shall not exceed the following values: For 1000 cycles a maximum rut depth of 0.15 inches; for 8000 cycles a maximum rut d epth of 0.20 inches. Test for Resistance to Chloride Ion Penetration: This test shall measure the resistance of a concrete specimen with an asphalt coating containing the special additive binder applied to its surface to the penetration of chloride ion.  T esting shall be performed in general accordance with AASHTO T259, Resistance of Concrete to Chloride Ion Penetration.  Four concrete test specimens shall be made and cured according to AASHTO  T126.  Each slab shall be not less than 3 inches thick and twelve inches square.  The specimens shall be moist cured for 14 days and placed in a drying room for 7 days according to AASHTO T160.  Each specimen shall then be removed from the drying room and be coated with a standard highway asphalt mix with additive contained in the binder.  When the specimens have cooled to ambient temperature, they shall be returned to the drying room for 7  days. At that time they shall be removed from the drying room, the dams built around the top edges of the specimens, and returned to the drying room for a final 14 days.  The degree of saturation of the specimens at the time of ponding will affect the chl oride ingress, i.e., water saturated concrete will absorb significantly less chlorides than a drier, but similar material.  Thus, for proper definition of chloride ingress, the requirements for a total of 28 days drying time must be strictly adhered to.  A t the end of the drying period, 42 days, three of the four specimens shall be subjected to continuous ponding with a three per cent sodium chloride solution approximately 0.5 inches deep for ninety days.  The fourth specimen shall be the control.  Glass pl ates shall be placed over the dams to retard evaporation of the solution and the specimens placed in the drying room for a ninety day period.  After 90 days of exposure, the solution shall be removed from the specimen, the specimens shall be allowed to dry , and all salt crystal build up shall be removed from the surfaces. Samples shall then be taken from depths of 0.0625 inches to 0.5 inches, and from 0.5 inches to 1.0 inches per AASHTO T259.  The chloride content shall then be determined for each sample in  accordance with  AASHTO T260.  Results shall be considered to satisfy criteria, negligible transmission of chloride ions, when either no sample exceeds 0.03 percent chlorides, or no sample exceeds the percent chloride in the control by greater than 0.01 p ercent. Test for Impermeability:  This test shall consist of preparing and testing  compacted hot mix samples employing the specific additive in accordance with ASTM D 5084, Hydraulic Conductivity, via Falling Head, Rising Tail,  to determine hydraulic con ductivity.  Results shall be considered to meet criteria, asphalt pavement samples are essentially impermeable, when the Hydraulic Conductivity of each sample is equal to or less than 10 to the minus eighth power cm per sec.  Test for Resilient Modulus: This test shall consist of preparing and testing laboratory-prepared Hot Mix Asphalt  samples using the proposed additive as an integral part of the binder to determine resilient modulus of elasticity at varying temperatures.  A ll testing shall be in accordance with ASTM D 4123 Indirect Tension Test for Resilient Modulus of Bituminous Mixtures.  Results shall be considered to satisfy criteria when the modulus of elasticity of all samples equals or exceed 200,000 pounds per square  inch at a test temperature of 25 degrees C. Test Values for Proposed Additive and Asphalt Binder Only: The following tests shall be performed on the proposed additive and asphalt binder, according to the referenced test methods indicated.  Nominal required values are listed also. The Performance Gra de Test per AASHTO MP1 shall produce a nominal result of PG 94 34. The Dynamic Shear Ratio Test per AASHTO TP5 shall produce a nominal result of 1.034 kPa at 118 degrees centigrade. The Creep Stiffness Test per AASHTO TP3 shall produce a nominal result of 90 Mpa at minus 24 degrees centigrade. The Elastic Recovery Test per ASTM D6084 shall produce a nominal result of  92 percent at 10 degrees centigrade. The Force Ratio Test per AASHTO T300 shall produce a nominal result of 0.99. The Toughness Test per ASTM  D5801 shall produce a nominal result of 210 inch pounds. The Tenacity Test per ASTM D5801 shall produce a nominal result of 140 inch pounds. Results shall be considered to satisfy criteria if all test result values fall within 5 percent  of the nominal va lues listed above. Manufacturers shall submit written specifications, catalog cuts,  and 3 customer references with greater than three years successful field installation of the product. Firm shall indicate whether it is small, large, disadvantaged, etc. The NAICS Code is 324121. This notice is for informational purposes only and is not a  solicitation. POC is Ann Marie Beauregard at 978-318-8668.

<SUBJECT>B -- Modification of the National Evaluation of the Comprehensive Community Mental Health Services Program for Children and Their Families
<DESC>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS), intends to procure on an other than full and open competitive basis with ORC Macro International, 11785 Beltsville Drive, Calverton, MD 20705, for modification of the contract for the National Evaluation of the Comprehensive Community Mental Health Services Program for Children and Their Families (i.e., Child Mental Health Initiative), to conduct the evaluation of the sixth year of 20 grants funded in fiscal year (FY) 1999 and the fifth and sixth years of 2 grants funded in FY 2000.  The statutory authority in 10 USC 2304(C)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), indicates that only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This requirement is considered to be available from only one source because of the lengthy lead time required to develop an adequate infrastructure to conduct the evaluation of the 22 grants of the federal grant program.  Therefore, SAMHSA has determined that award to any other source would likely require a significant period of infrastructure development resulting in a high probability of failure and a significant increase in costs that are not expected to be recovered through competition.   

The current design of the national evaluation includes a baseline description of the population of children and families as they enter systems of care; a longitudinal study to assess improvements in child and family outcomes; a study to assess the impact of evidence-based practices in systems of care; a study of services, costs, and cost-effectiveness; assessment of fidelity to the system-of-care approach; and a sustainability study.  The objectives of the national evaluation are to (1) evaluate the effectiveness of systems of care through implementation of evidence-based interventions; (2) develop and implement a performance-based accountability system for the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART), and for the grantees of the Program, that demonstrates improvements among children with serious emotional disturbance, and children with co-occurring mental and substance use disorders; (3) demonstrate the transformation of the mental health system for children with serious emotional disturbance using a system-of-care approach; (4) document the extent to which systems of care eliminate racial, ethnic, and cultural disparities; (5) describe outcomes of implementing individualized care plans for each child with a serious emotional disturbance, and the child’s family; and (6) demonstrate the extent to which family members are involved in planning, evaluation, and services, and how their own functioning and satisfaction with services improves.  The estimated period of performance is 24 months.  This announcement is for informational purposes only.  No solicitation is available.  Send written responses to the point of contact identified above, referencing 280-99-8023.

<SUBJECT>U -- INDUSTRY DAY for United Kingdom C-17 Training Program
<DESC>Air Force Security Assistance Training (AFSAT/SM) UK C-17 Training Program, plans to host an Industry Day on behalf of and in support of the UK C-17 Maintenance Training School, VCTMS, Royal Air Force (RAF) Brize Norton, UK during August 4-5 2004 starting at 7:30AM and are seeking interested Industry Representatives to participate. This Industry Day will be conducted at Charleston AFB, SC.  We will be meeting the first day (7:30 am – 1:00 pm) at the Base Education Service Center.  The afternoon of the first day (1:30 – 5:00 pm) and the entire second day, we will conduct one-on-one discussions at 315 Airlift Wing Training Offices.  Directions between the two locations and vendor setup details will be provided to registered vendors once online registration has concluded.   

The goal of this Industry Day is to solicit input from industry to assist the United Kingdom in market research related to computer based training capabilities relevant to the C-17 aircraft operation and maintenance.  Specifically, the meeting is to: (1) discuss technical information related to UK C-17 maintenance training, (2) present/demonstrate current “off the shelf” capabilities that are currently available to support UK C-17 maintenance training effort (stressing previously developed technologies/capabilities), (3) to promote technical exchange among government, industry, academia, and other interested parties, and (4) obtain Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) pricing for proposed IMI technologies if selected for use in their C-17 maintenance training programs.  The operational objective is to provide Royal Air Force (RAF) maintenance instructors with the skills necessary to provide O-level maintenance training in support of the UK C-17 fleet via use of Interactive Multimedia Instruction (IMI), Computer Based Training (CBT), Computer Assisted Instruction (CAI) and other training technologies as augmented training aids to their organic training program, effective 2005.  The effort may include contractor identification, development, and implementation of required IMI/CBT/CAI type C-17 Maintenance training aids and or materials.  IMI based courseware may be used to train RAF maintenance personnel in the performance of specific maintenance tasks. These maintenance tasks will be included in the C-17 bidders' library.  At the completion of the Industry Day, vendors should have an appreciation for the scope and breadth of the UK C-17 program and the available opportunities. The AFSAT and UK should also appreciate the interest and capabilities represented in the contractor community.

Participating parties are encouraged to explore the possibility of teaming arrangements that develop integrated solutions to this topic area. IMI and all training technologies demonstrated at this Industry Day should have been developed considering the Instructional Systems Design/Development (ISD) process along with demonstrated concepts/procedures listed in:  1)  AETC Instruction 36–2209, Development and Maintenance of Interactive Multimedia Instruction (IMI), 2)  AFH 36-2235, Volume 5, Information for Designers of Instructional Systems: Advanced Distributed Learning: Instructional Technology and Distance Learning, 3)  MIL-HDBK-29612-3A, Development of Interactive Multimedia Instruction, and 4)  Air Force Institute for Advanced Distributed Learning (AFIADL) Guide for Authors of Interactive Multimedia Instruction ( IMI Guide).  

All discussions and materials presented as this Industry Day will be UNCLASSIFIED.  No contractor proprietary data will be allowed during open briefings and demonstrations. No “on-line internet” accessibility will be provided, so vendors should be prepared to conduct their presentations via alternate and “stand alone” delivery means.  A preliminary Government presentation will take place in the morning of the first day followed by an open discussion period between Government and Industry Representatives. Time will be set aside for vendor questions. A vendor display area will be available for limited demonstrations the morning of 4 Aug 04.  Additionally, one-on-one capability discussions/demonstrations are encouraged and will be scheduled, beginning the afternoon of 4 Aug 04 and continuing all day 5 Aug 04, depending on the number of vendors that register for this interchange via the website below. 

Vendors interested in attending the conference and scheduling one-on-one discussions must register by noon CT 23 July 04 via the following website:  http://www.aetc.randolph.af.mil/afsat/index.htm
ENROLLMENT for this Industry Day is LIMITED to the FIRST 25 REGISTERED VENDOR COMPANIES.  Due to space limitations, attendance is limited to a maximum of two representatives from each company/vendor.  Confirmation and driving details will be provided to the first 25 vendors who complete the above on-line registration.  A notice will be posted on the website when registration is closed.  

All attendees must be registered and present confirmation in order to be allowed on base.  Due to heightened security, please allow time to process onto the base.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation F33DOL41280100 is issued as a request for proposal (RFP).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-23, effective 05 May 2004 and FAC 2001-19 Update effective 28 May 2004.  The Government contemplates award of a Firm-Fixed Price Purchase Order resulting from this solicitation.  The NAICS code is 339111 and the size standard in 500 employees.  This is a 100 % small business set-aside.  The following requirements are being solicited:  The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Munitions Directorate, Ordnance Division, Energetic Materials Branch (MNME) requires an In-Vacuum XYZ Translation System for its Benchtop Energetics project.  Basic Configuration:  In this paragraph, system components to be provided by the vendor are underlined; those to be provided by AFRL/MNME will be identified as “government furnished equipment” or “GFE.”  The GFE will not be made available to the vendor for testing.  The envisioned system will include an in-vacuum positioner comprised of three linear translation stages assembled to provide controlled motion in three mutually perpendicular directions; the two horizontal directions labeled X and Y, and the vertical direction Z.  These stages will be compatible with operation within a high-vacuum enclosure (GFE) at background pressures of order 10-6 torr.  The positioner will communicate with a stand-alone motion controller/driver via two-piece interface cables.  The interface cables will be comprised of in-vacuum, and in-air sections, and will be joined using standard multipin connectors (e.g. D9 or D15 or D25) to permit compatibility with the off-the-shelf vacuum feedthroughs (GFE).  The motion controller/driver will communicate with a personal computer controller (GFE) via either USB or IEEE-488 GPIB interfaces.  The system will include any software required for communication between the motion controller and the computer, and the Vendor is invited to include a description of available software packages for programming the motion controller via the computer.  The motion controller/driver will provide a TTL level output available at a BNC connector, which will remain TTL LOW while the positioner is moving and will transition to TTL HI when the motion is completed.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS:  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests(OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office(GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award or performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3)
                            2100 Second Street, SW

<DESC>QUESTIONS and ANSWERS

1) Section L.1.4 Executive Summary Matrix.  We understand that the Executive Summary Matrix is limited to 2 pages and is not counted against the volume I page limit.  Is there page limit for the Executive Summary itself and is it counted against the volume page limit?

Response: There is no requirement for an Executive Summary per se (beyond the Executive Summary Matrix). Therefore should the bidder include an executive summary it will be counted against the page limit for the volume in which it is included.



2) Past Performance Sections L.2.2.2 and L.2.2.3 appear to be asking for the same references.  Can we combine these two into one template that mirrors the template for Iraq experiences and reference (L.2.2.4)?


Response: No objection to combining reference sections.



POC for this solicitation is LTC Karen Maskew, karen.maskew@cpa-iq.org.  Please submit PROPOSALS in writing only.
