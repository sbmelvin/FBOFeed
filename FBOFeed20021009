<DESC>The United States Coast Guard, Operation Systems Center intends to award on a limited source basis, contracts with Globe Wireless, Foster City, CA, and MMR Radio, Cedar Knolls, NJ, for message service from ships at sea to the Coast Guard Operations Systems Center in Kearneysville, WV, via Coast Guard paid circuits.  To compensate these public coast stations for the handling and delivery of AMVER messages, the Coast Guard will pay the radio stations directly for delivery of each AMVER message.  The Contractors will use delivery invoices to bill the Coast Guard for all AMVER messages electronically delivered.  

It is believed that these 2 radio stations are the sole remaining Coast Station operators in the United States that operate the type of system needed by the Coast Guard.  There used to be many operators over the years; however, they have gone out of the business or been sold to these 2 remaining operators.  Many ships have other methods of communicating directly with whomever they want and do not need the "middle man" services provided by MMR and Globe.  Globe relays SITOR messages that are sent by participating vessels.  Mobile relays both Morse Code as well as SITORS.  Mobile is the only coast station that relays Morse Code.

The Government intends to negotiate with only these 2 sources under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b).  The reason justifying this limited source procurement is that the Goverment believes that only these 2 responsible sources can furnish the services that will satisfy the Government's requirements.  Any firm that believes it can satisfy the services described above are encouraged to give written notification to the Contracting Officer.  Supporting evidence must be furnished, in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to satisy the Coast Guard's requirements.  All responses received by the close of business on October 18, 2002 will be considered.  Any future action based on responses to this notice will be at the sole discretion of the Government.  Inquiries will only be accepted by e-mail or fax (304/262-5997).

<CONTACT>Gaile Higashi, Contracting Officer, 630-252-2383, gaile.higashi@ch.doe.gov;Kristin Palmer, Contract Specialist, 630-252-2708, kristin.palmer@ch.doe.gov
<DESC>DOE intends to issue a Financial Assistance Solicitation on or about December 1, 2002 for integrated demonstration of communication and control solutions that would enable interoperable and integrated operation of large numbers of distributed energy resources (DER) from varying suppliers to achieve optimization in power quality, power reliability and economic performance. The objective of the solicitation is to demonstrate sensing, communication, information and control technologies to achieve a seamless integration of multi-vendor DER units at aggregation levels that meet individual user requirements for facility operations (residential, commercial, industrial, manufacturing, etc.) and further serve as resource options for electric and natural gas utilities.  The fully demonstrated DER aggregation system with embodiment of communication and control technologies will lead to real-time, interactive customer-managed service networks to achieve greater customer value. The scope of work for this cooperative research and development solicitation will be in two phases.  It is DOE?s intent to evaluate submitted designs and business plans in Phase I, and support the further testing of only the most promising approaches in Phase II.  Phase I activities involve the design and the proof-of-design stage and Phase II involves the demonstration of the Phase I design architecture to a large scale in real-world settings while integrating with the operations of one or more feeder lines.  The duration of the Phase I project is expected to be six months, with the entire project?s scope of work ? for Phase I and Phase II combined ? to be completed within 2.5 years.  DOE expects to award four to six cooperative agreements under this solicitation for Phase I.  Estimated total DOE funding for Phase I is $1.2M.  It is anticipated that two or three of the Phase I applicants will proceed to Phase II.  Any future DOE funding for Phase II is subject to the availability of funds. Estimated total DOE funding for Phase II is $1.8M.  A minimum non-federal cost sharing commitment of 20% of the total proposed costs for Phase I is required. A minimum non-federal cost sharing commitment of 50% of the total proposed costs for Phase II is required.  Any non-profit or for-profit organization or other institution of higher education, or non-federal agency or entity is eligible to apply, unless otherwise restricted by the Simpson-Craig Amendment. Integrated project teams that include electric utilities (investor-owned, municipal, cooperative), energy service companies, DER suppliers, information technology providers and customers who will use the aggregated DER system are highly encouraged.  Collaborations with state energy agencies, national laboratories and universities are also encouraged.  DOE National Laboratory participation as a subcontractor is limited to no more than 20% of the total cost of all tasks to be performed.  The response due date is anticipated to be on or about January 31, 2003.  Specific response instructions and deadlines will be included in the solicitation package.  The solicitation when issued will include a narrative statement of work, program requirements, qualification criteria, evaluation criteria, program policy factors and other information. It is further anticipated that award(s) as a result of the solicitation will be made in May 2003.   The solicitation and any amendments will be available on DOE?s ?Industry Interactive Procurement System? (IIPS) Web page located at http://e-center.doe.gov on or about December 1, 2002.  Prospective applicants can obtain access to the solicitation from the above Internet address or through the DOE Chicago Operations Office (CH) Internet address at http://www.ch.doe.gov under ?current solicitations?.

<DESC>The Transportation Security Administration seeks qualified firms to provide selection assessments to be used as component(s) of Transportation Security Administration (TSA) selection systems for law enforcement and security screener positions.  Specifically, TSA seeks firms that may provide the following types of selection assessments:  1) normal personality; 2) psychological; and 3) English proficiency.  

All three assessments, normal personality, psychological, and English proficiency MUST meet the following criteria: 
a) be developed and used consistent with generally accepted professional principles as exemplified by the Principles for the Validation and Use of Personnel Selection Procedures; Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures; and the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing;
b) have available normative data for a sample(s) of working adults, and descriptive statistics including subgroup data by race, national origin, and age;
c) be able to be administered in both pencil and paper and computerized formats; and
d) be supported by a manual or technical reports that provide clear evidence of validity for use in employment selection.

NUMBER ONE (1) - The instrument for assessing normal personality MUST meet the following criteria:
a) be based on the Five Factor Model (FFM; "Big Five") of normal personality;
b) have demonstrated validity for law enforcement and security jobs;
c) be supported by a manual or technical reports that provide clear evidence of construct and criterion-related validity. 

NUMBER TWO (2) - The instrument for psychological assessments must be useful in screening out individuals unlikely to be suitable for employment in the positions of interest and must be appropriate for administration to candidates prior to a bona fide offer of employment, i.e., must not elicit information about or otherwise result in a diagnosis of a disability. 

NUMBER THREE (3) - The instruments for English proficiency MUST have established validity evidence for measuring the ability to read, speak, understand, and write English sufficiently so as to:
a) receive and carry out written and oral instructions regarding the proper performance of screening duties; 
b) read English language identification media, credentials, airline tickets, and labels on items normally encountered in the screening process, as well as read English language during various training courses, read English language of equipment operations and safety procedures, and read English language of various federal employment forms, security-related bulletins, memos, and notices, and all other related reading requirements on the job (i.e., screener logs, incident reports); 
c) provide direction to, and understand and answer questions from, English-speaking individuals undergoing screening; and 
d) write incident reports and statements and log entries into security records in the English language. 

Note that English reading, writing and listening assessments used for strictly academic purposes or primarily for assessment of individuals for that English is a second language WILL NOT be considered.

Interested parties should submit a qualification statement, not exceeding three (3) pages, that addresses the following issues consistent with the above specifications:

a) brief description of the instrument (e.g. number of items, administration time, constructs measured, etc.);
b) narrative summary describing instrument development
c) narrative and tabular summary of validity evidence for jobs of interest or similar jobs, including sample description(s) and criterion measure(s), validity coefficients, and adverse impact statistics 

Offerors may submit qualification statements for one, two or all three assessment types.   If an offeror is submitting responses for two or all three, the offeror shall submit a separate qualification statement for each assessment type, each within the page limit specified above.

A Government Team will evaluate the qualification statements received and will determine which submissions meet the Government's need/requirement, as stated above. Offerors that meets the TSA's minimum need/requirement will be included in the bidders' mailing list.  Any offeror that fails to demonstrate that they meet the TSA's minimum need/requirement will be excluded from any further consideration.

Responses may be submitted via email, to paul.casagrande@tsa.dot.gov, or facsimile to (202) 493-1802.  Responses are due by 5:00 PM, EST, Wednesday, October 23, 2002.

Award to any other source would likely result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency requirements. Currently, the RFP has not been prepared; however, the requirements should parallel those contained in Option Year 6 of the existing contract and can be viewed at https://cms1.ssg.gunter.af.mil.  Respondent is to specify in its response whether it is a large business, small business, very small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a) concern, women-owned small business, HUBZone small business, veteran-owned small business or service-disabled veteran-owned small business.  Also, respondents shall specify if U.S.- or foreign-owned.  Reference numbered notes 12, 22, and 26.

An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential sources.  The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the Program Manager or Contracting Officer, but to communicate offeror concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of the proposals or in the source selection process.  The Ombudsman should only be contacted with issues or problems previously brought to the attention of the Program Manager and/or the Contracting Officer, which could not be satisfactorily resolved, or issues that require contractor confidentiality.  The Ombudsman for this acquisition is Col Jerry T. Corley, ESC/CO, at telephone Number:  (781) 377-5106.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM), acting on behalf of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Department of Defense, to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Regenstrief Institute, Inc. under the authority of FAR 6.302.  The required work entails the creation of new records, maintenance of existing records, and electronic distribution of Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC), a registered trademark of the Regenstrief Institute's database.  LOINC is a coding system for laboratory tests and other clinical measures used in electronic transactions between independent computer systems.  LOINC is distributed free via the Internet and is also included in NLM's Unified Medical Language System Metathesaurus (UMLS).   The purpose of this contract is to ensure the continuance of LOINC as a freely available and openly developed source of standard identifiers, names, and codes for clinical observations, claims attachments sets, and individual questions being asked as part of claims attachments.  The development of LOINC was initiated and is directed by the Regenstrief Institute, Inc. which leads the LOINC Committee of volunteers from academia, industry, and government who maintain the coding system.  LOINC development has been partially supported by a private foundation, the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, and the National Library of Medicine.  LOINC has been selected for use by the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense, and the Indian Health Service for mutual exchange of laboratory data as part of the Federal Health Information Exchange project, formerly known as the Government Computer-Based Patient Record (GCPR).  LOINC has been specified as one of the standards for the National Electronic Disease Surveillance System (NEDSS) initiative developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  It is the standard coding system for segments of the HL7 clinical message standard.  It will be proposed as a national standard for use in claims attachments under the Administration Simplification provision of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, which will require additional expansion of its content.  Because this coding system is unique and is a proprietary project of the Regenstrief Institute, Inc. and the LOINC Committee, NLM has determined the Regenstrief Institute, Inc. is the only source capable of providing the necessary services.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, nor is a Request for Proposals available.  However, all proposals received within forty-five days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the National Library of Medicine.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to make clarification of an issue raised. The intention in the design of the positioning system is to maximize use of space within the vacuum chamber.  The "not to exceed 24 inches in any primary direction" restriction is for the physical dimensions of the positioning system, not of the extreme locations of the sample on top of the positioning stage.  The range of motion of +/-6 inches is to allow us to work with a sample larger than the 6"x6" table surface.  If possible, the surface of the positioning table should be the highest point in the design, so that none of the components in the positioning system would interfere with positioning a sample larger than the table surface.

<DESC>Below are Questions and responses in regards to the solicitation. Question 1 : We understand this solicitation is a RFP (mentioned in the beginning of the solicitation). But we are confused in the part of "E. Cost, Contract Award" (near the end of the solicitation) it says "..., in conforming to this RFQ,...". Is this solicitation a RFP or RFQ?  Question 1 Government Response: This acquisition is in accordance with FAR 13.5 - Test Program for Certain Commercial Items. Simplified acquisition procedures are being used in accordance with FAR 13.5, therefore, this is an RFQ. The contractor shall provide a Technical proposal and a price quote. Question 2: Is this solicitation a small business set aside or not?  Question 2 Government Response: This acquisition is not a small business set-aside.  Question 3 : Is there a criterion that you based on to set the requirement for using 2 ng or less DNA per assay? In other words, which type of technology do you use in your studies to use 2 ng of DNA for the assay?  Question 3 Government Response: For our present studies, we want to use less than 2 ng sample DNA per genotype. Our current technologies allow us to use from 0.25 ng to 2.0 ng DNA per genotype (MALDI-TOF, SNaPshot, and others). We are seeking technologies which either require less DNA per reaction or can reliably work in multiplexed reactions so that overall less DNA per genotype is consumed. Question 4 : Do you have any preference of using an existing SNP assay?  Question 4 Government Response: If an existing assay can be proven to interrogate the specific SNP requested and passes our QC steps, then we will accept that assay for this contract. Question 5 : Is there a time line for the assay development for the first 25 SNPs? Question 5 Government Response: We would expect completion of the first 25 assays within 3 months of the beginning of the project initiation. We would be willing to negotiate somewhat on timing with the appropriate discussions. Question 6: Will all of the SNP assays established in phase 1 of this project be applied to phase 2 and phase 3 samples?  Question 6 Government Response: Yes, all of the SNP assays established in phase 1 of this project are applied to phase 2 and phase 3 samples. Question 7: Will all of the desired SNPs to be analyzed for this contract be supplied to the contractor in electronic format at the same time, or at different times?  Question 7Government Response: The majority of the assays will be supplied at one time but there will be other assay requests made during the contract period. Question 8: For cost estimation purposes, should we use 25 SNPs per sample, 50 SNPs per sample, or an intermediate number? Question 8 Government Response: For cost estimation purposed, the ideal would be to use the 25 for a 'low # estimate' and the 50 for a 'hi # estimate' to give an estimate with a low/high range. If that is not possible, then use the 50 for the estimate. Question 9: For cost estimation purposes, should we assume that all phases of the project will have the identical number of SNP analyses required for each sample? Question 9 Government Response: Yes, for cost estimation purposes, assume that all phases of the project will have the identical number of SNP analyses required for each sample. Question 10: For cost estimation purposes, should we include costing of the fourth and optional phase of 3000 clinical DNA samples, and would the number of SNPs required be identical to the assay quality control samples and the pilot clinical sample set? Question 10 Government Response: Yes, for cost estimation purposes, include costing of the fourth and optional phase of 3000 clinical DNA samples and the number of SNP analyses required for each sample will be the same as for the assay quality control samples and the pilot clinical samples. Question 11: Will the DNA which is provided to the contractor for SNP analyses be accurately quantitated? Government Response: The DNA provided to the contractor will be quantitated by a picogreen DNA quantification assay before shipment to the contractor. Question 12: Has any previous genotyping work been performed on the "variety of clinical samples" to be genotyped in this contract, which would have demonstrated that the quality of all (or at least 80%) of the samples is sufficient for genotyping analysis (i.e. the DNAs are not extensively degraded)? Question 12 Government Response: Yes, the clinical DNA samples will have been though our lab quality control process and generated previous genotyping data of sufficient quality to expect them to perform well in the assays for this contract.

PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE
for
Smithsonian Website/Multimedia Pro-Bono [No Out-of-Pocket, or Under-Market-Value really] Development

1.	General.  The Smithsonian Institution was created by Act of the United States Congress in 1846 to carry out the terms of the Will of James Smithson who bequeathed the means to found a national institution based in Washington dedicated to  "the increase and diffusion of knowledge . . . ."  The estate property was accepted by Congress which pledged the faith of the United States to a charitable trust for the benefit of the People of the United States.  The trust is administered by the Smithsonian Board of Regents, composed of the Chief Justice, the Vice President, three Members of the Senate, three Members of the House of Representatives, and nine citizens appointed by joint resolution of Congress.

2.	Background.  On April 30, 2002, the Smithsonian Office of Equal Employment and Minority Affairs (OEEMA) in conjunction with the Smithsonian Office of Contracting (OCon) conducted a Web/Multimedia Fair in which 68 web/multimedia vendors/producers participated.  At the Fair, Smithsonian staff were approached by multiple vendors requesting information about contracting opportunities for Smithsonian projects, whether paid or not.  In response to this unforeseen demand, Smithsonian program offices were invited to create a "wish-list" of projects for which development and implementation were immediately desirable.  The result is attached separately to this notice for the review of any interested vendors (the "Wish List").

3.	Project Descriptions.  The Wish List is a synopsis, by Smithsonian museum/program office, of current needs for which there is no or insufficient money for development.  For all identified projects, we have estimated project size in accordance with the following scale: (A More Perfect Union <http://americanhistory.si.edu/perfectunion/experience/index.html> = small, Hirshhorn redesign <http://www.hirshhorn.si.edu/> = medium, Explore the Universe <http://www.nasm.si.edu/galleries/gal111/universe/etu/index.html> = large), and, where relevant, the desired timeframe for completion. Initially created and posted on June 25, 2002, we intend to keep the Wish List up to date, adding newly identified needs and removing projects for which sufficient qualified and serious vendor response has been received as well as any for which a full commitment for programmatic support has lapsed.  Smithsonian reserves the right to rescind the Wish List in the event that insufficient response is generated on the identified projects.

4.	Minimum Requirements for Pre-Solicitation Response.  We can't build it if you don't come, therefore we invite interested and qualified vendors to identify those projects for which they would like to submit an offer.  To be responsive, submissions need merely identify your company, your URL, and any project(s) for which you desire the opportunity to develop on a pro bono basis. Please be sure to stipulate any restrictions which may apply to your level of interest (stating a hierarchy of preferred projects if, for example, you would care to submit a proposal for multiple ones but only enter into a contract to create a single one). This information will be collected and distributed to the originating program offices on a rolling basis, and for each project, as soon as a suitable bidlist has been established (e.g., at least 2-3 qualified candidates) we will contact the prospective offerors.  An indication of project interest by vendor(s) shall NEITHER obligate the vendor to submit a proposal to perform any work NOR obligate Smithsonian to invite proposals or issue contract(s) to have work performed.

5.	Responding to this Announcement:  Prospective offerors may ONLY submit information via e-mail to Bruce Falk, Office of Contracting at FalkB@si.edu.  Since it is presumed that relevant portfolios are viewable at the vendors' URL or obtainable upon request, no work samples are sought or required at this time. Offerors who submitted proposals in response to Smithsonian?s IDIQ RFP#F0236SOL0012 are permitted to make reference to any samples provided therein.  For these reasons, submissions greater than ONE SINGLE PAGE in length will be met with disdain.  (We are trying to make identification of desirable projects by interested firms as easy as possible; invited vendors will be given full opportunity to provide proposal(s) which address in detail specific project requirements.)

6.	Methodology for Competition.  Because these projects have little or no money attached to them, we will conduct the solicitation process in the following way.  First, the seriousness of vendor intent will be determined by follow-up contact prior to establishment of a bidlist, as bidlists will be kept small (preferring three offerors, but in no event more than five ? to the extent that more than five vendors express serious interest in a given project, we will make a determination as to which vendors to invite to submit a bid to ensure limited competition while minimizing vendor burden).  Second, identified, interested vendors will be provided with all criteria needed to draft a responsive proposal and invited to an initial discussion with the project team at least two weeks prior to the formal submission date.  Finally, Smithsonian shall evaluate the received proposals and intends to award a contract to the offeror whose proposal is evaluated to be responsive to project/solicitation requirements and the best from among all proposals received.  While specific criteria for any given project will be established and provided to preselected offerors prior to establishing a proposal due date, it is likely that credit recognition for any pro bono work awarded as a result of this announcement will be approximately equal to or greater than that currently offered by Smithsonian for its fully-budgeted development.

7.	Further Contact Info.  Please contact Bruce Falk immediately if you desire to receive a copy of the Wish List by e-mail, fax, or other format.  Vendors desiring clarification can submit questions either by phone (202) 275-1602, or in writing, by e-mail, or by fax at (202) 275-0624.  (We will make all reasonable effort to answer questions, but cannot guarantee response.)  Thank you for your attention to this pre-solicitation notice.  We look forward to hearing from you!

<DESC>This modification is hereby issued to change the point of contacts to Beverly Williams, Contract Specialist and Shedric Crump, Contracting Officer. The following information remains unchanged:  This is a market survey to determine the availability of state of the art mobile transportable storage.  The following Portable Fuel Storage specification is provided to give an in-depth description of services required:  

The Department of Defense requires portable fuel storage systems.  These systems are composed of individual storage containers that must be fully capable of holding and compatible with military and commercial specification fuel without leaking or seeping.  The systems must have the ability to receive and issue fuel simultaneously.  Operating conditions for these systems consists of cold to desert field environment with temperatures ranging from a negative 25 degree Fahrenheit to a positive 150 degree Fahrenheit.  In addition, the containers must have a storage life of 10 years with temperature variables of a negative 30 degree Fahrenheit to a positive 160 degree Fahrenheit.  The system must be capable of holding fuel in the following three categories:

Category I: A highly transportable, very temporary, lightweight individual storage system consisting of one or more containers with a combined storage capacity up to 60,000 US Gallons (USG).

	Operation Concept:  A transportable temporary, lightweight tactical, fuel storage system, consisting of individual fuel storage containers, with the ability to be fully operational within four hours using only four or less personnel and no Materiel Handling Equipment (MHE).  Once establish and fuel is introduced into the system, it should remain operational, without failure, for a minimum of three years.  This temporary fuel storage system will also require the following specifications:

o	Individual storage containers should range nominally from 3,000 through 60,000 USG.
o	Individual storage container?s expected minimum storage life from date of manufacture is 10 years in any type of storage environment.
o	 Storage system should be highly transportable and include shipping dimensions not to exceed those of a TRICON container (6 feet 2 1/16 inch x 7 feet 6 ? inch x 7 feet 5 ? inch (L x W x H)).
o	All water and fuel must have the ability to be easily evacuated from the system.
o	System must be field repairable by field personnel with minimal additional gear.
o	Interoperability with standard 2 ? 4 inches US KAM-LOC connections.

Category II: A transportable, temporary, medium weight individual storage system consisting of one or more containers with a combined storage capacity of 60,000 to 1 million USG.

	Operation Concept:  A temporary, tactical, fuel storage system, consisting of individual fuel storage containers, with the ability to be fully operational within 24 hours using a maximum of eight personnel and a 4,000 lbs. Forklift.  Once established and fuel is introduced into the system, it should remain operational, without failure, for a minimum of three years.  This temporary fuel storage system will also require the following specifications:

o	Individual storage containers should range nominally from 20,000 through 50,000 USG.

<SUBJECT>70 -- Commercial Off the Shelf Workload Scheduling Software
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-KC-2003-FCAD01
<RESPDATE>102102

<CONTACT>Steven Prado, Contract Specialist, Phone 816-926-6759, Fax 816-926-1782, Email smprado@kcc.usda.gov
<DESC>This is Request for Information not a Request for Proposal to locate potential sources for a Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) Workload Scheduling tool for the Farm Service Agency (FSA) an agency of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). FSA has a need for moving the scheduling, tracking, follow-up and completion of workload activities to the Internet.  Most of the workload activities for making and servicing loans are required by regulation and/or statute and must be completed within specific time frames.  There is a need to know the number of county activities completed, incomplete, and canceled/deleted at the county, State, and National levels and the time frames involved.  There is need to have history of what has been accomplished or not accomplished for at least three fiscal years.

The Government Paperwork Elimination Act of 1989 (GPEA) mandates government agencies to provide individuals and entities the option to submit information, transact business and maintain records electronically as an alternative to manual processes.  E-Loans supports IT initiatives that meet its objectives of creating a Web-enabled and fully integrated loan-making environment and seamless loan-making process with reduced paper-based manual processes and increased efficiency.  This IT initiative also supports the President?s Management Agenda and FFAMIA (P.L. 106-107).

FSA has identified the need to replace their existing IBM AS-400 based Workload Scheduling facility of the Management of Agricultural Credit (MAC) software.  MAC software renamed Direct Loan System (DLS) is being reengineered and developed for the Web.  Its sister system, the Guaranteed Loan System (GLS) is already Web-based and has no workload scheduling component.

The COTS workload scheduling component software must be compatible with DLS/GLS and their DB2 databases. The workload scheduling component must be able to receive data from different DB2 databases which store data from DLS, GLS and other Farm Service Agency systems.  It must have the ability to send data to the same systems.  Access to workload scheduling data must be easy. For example, a button or tab on a Web page or other web-enabled screens.  Users should be able to access and update workload information grouped by customer, subject (item code) and/or due/follow-up date. 

Whatever workload items in MAC/DLS that are generated automatically and/or completed automatically through data input into the DLS system must remain automatic.  Agency personnel must be able to create and modify workload scheduling items from their DLS/GLS systems.   In the current MAC system, National Office-defined workload scheduling items are standardized. The State and County Offices also possess the ability to add to these standardized items with local items that they create.  At a minimum, the new workload scheduling component software must provide the same functionality.

Workload scheduling must be tied to a calendar system such as Microsoft Outlook or similar product.  The calendar system must provide for the county office calendar as well as individual county employee calendars.  In addition, workload items may also be created and completed from the calendar with the revised status or new workload item sent back to the DLS/GLS DB2 databases for storage.

The new workload scheduling component must have the capability to generate reports with selection and sort capabilities and also have the ability to download data into an Excel spreadsheet.

The Farm Service Agency has a technical requirement that all software placed on a PC in the Service Center. The software must be Section 508 compliant.  The FSA uses Page Screamer with Spider as the software to test for 508 compliance.  The software must also be compatible with Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP).  The software must be able to convert existing PDF (Adobe) forms into E-forms input documents, utilizing the application database to gather and present information.  Database connectivity must be ODBC compliant.  

Software must use common industry available Web-based reporting tools (i.e. Crystal Reports, Brio, WebFOCUS, etc.), which will allow output to be created in HTML, Excel, PDF and other common output formats.  

Only firms that currently have software product(s) possessing the above characteristics are invited to response to the RFI.  Responses should include: (1) Two (2) copies of all technical documentation, limited to twenty (20) pages, which address each of the above described characteristics and any other important technical aspects of the product.  (2) Commercial price list or GSA schedule for license and maintenance fees  (3) Points of contact (including name e-mail address, phone number and fax number) from three customers currently using the identified product.  This is an RFI and not a request for comments or a request for proposals.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - Sandra J Jones, Contract Specialist, 858-537-0306
<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR), Program Management Warfare-176, San Diego is interested in identifying sources who can provide a fully integrated C, X, and Ka band SHF SATCOM system. Background The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) intends to seek sources capable of designing and producing the next generation of the Navy?s wideband super high frequency (SHF) shipboard satellite communications (SATCOM) terminal for surface ships, the AN/WSC-6(V)XX, via a solicitation planned for the Third Quarter of Fiscal Year 2003.  This request for information (RFI) seeks responses that will be used in developing the contract specification for the AN/WSC-6(V)XX. The AN/WSC-6(V)XX shall support full duplex communications simultaneously in multiple frequency bands to communicate with the Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS), commercial SATCOM, and the planned Wideband Gapfiller System (WGS) Satellites.  Defined by the frequency plans of present and planned military and commercial communications satellites, these simultaneous multi-band capabilities shall include the ability to support full duplex communications (a) in the Government X (7/8 GHz) band at the same time as in the Government K/Ka (20/30 GHz) band, or  (b) in the non-Government C (4/6 GHz) band at the same time as in one of the non-Government Ku (11/12/14 GHz) bands.  Capability (a) and (b) are not required simultaneously; switching between the two capabilities must be accomplished in less than or equal to 30 minutes. Maximum conformance of the AN/WSC-6(V)XX to MIL-STD-188-164A as is reasonable in the shipboard application is desired.   AN/WSC-6(V)XX certification for operation on military and commercial SATCOM systems is a threshold requirement. The AN/WSC-6(V)XX contract specification will contain a common terminal with four variants distinguished by antenna size intended for various ship classes.  The four antenna aperture diameters are currently envisioned to be approximately 38, 60, 93 and 108 inches although the actual sizes shall be proposed by offerors in response to the G/T and EIRP requirements in the final contract specification.  The terminal will not be required to provide C-band capability in the smallest antenna size. The AN/WSC-6(V)XX shall provide external modem interfaces at intermediate frequencies (IF) of 70 MHz, 140 MHz and L-band frequencies consistent with those required by the emerging Enhanced Bandwidth Efficient Modem (EBEM) specification.  In addition, the terminal shall provide a dedicated IF output at 950-1950 MHz in order to make available Global Broadcast Service (GBS) signals received in the Government K or X space-to-Earth bands to a separately procured GBS receiver.  It is desired that the AN/WSC-6(V)XX operate only with external modems and not contain an internal modem.  The AN/WSC-6(V)XX shall provide 10/100 Base-T Ethernet and EIA/TIA-422 serial outputs for simultaneous control of up to four external modems from the terminal?s operator interface unit (OIU). The AN/WSC-6(V)XX shall be capable of controlling one, two or four topside antennas simultaneously.  In the multiple antenna configurations, the terminal shall be capable of handing off from one antenna to another (configured for the same radio frequency bands) with a means for preserving bit count integrity (BCI) that is independent of the modem.  (BCI is defined here as the maintenance of cryptographic equipment synchronization.)  An interface shall provide a signal indicating initiation of a handover event for use by the external modem.  It is envisioned the antennas will operate in single or pair configuration with handover events occurring only between a dedicated pair of antennas operating in the same bands with the same satellite. Requested Information Commercial companies and other technical organizations are hereby invited to provide information on their previous demonstrations of, and/or capabilities to develop technologies to support any of the following capabilities in the AN/WSC-6(V)XX.  This information will be considered in developing the final contract specification for the AN/WSC-6(V)XX such that this new terminal expands the Navy?s shipboard wideband SATCOM capabilities in a fashion that can be realized affordably. X/K/Ka Feed The terminal shall have a feed system capable of supporting simultaneous communications with two full duplex carriers in the Government X-band and at least one transmit carrier in the Government Ka-band and two simultaneous receive carriers in the Government K-band.  The threshold frequency coverage is as follows; X: 7.25-7.75 GHz space-to-Earth, 7.9-8.4 GHz Earth-to-space; K/Ka: 20.2-21.2 GHz (K) space-to-Earth, 30-31 GHz (Ka) Earth-to-space.  The objective frequency coverage would add a portion of non-Government K/Ka:19.2-20.2 GHz (K) space-to-Earth, 29-30 GHz (Ka) Earth-to-space without compromising RF performance in the threshold frequency ranges by more than 1 dB.  As a threshold requirement, the feed system shall provide left hand circular polarization (LHCP) for reception of X-band signals and right hand circular polarization (RHCP) for transmission of X-band signals.  An objective capability would add non-simultaneous selectable right hand circular polarization (RHCP) for reception of X-band signals.  As a threshold requirement, the feed system shall provide simultaneous RHCP and LHCP for reception of K-band signals and selectable LHCP and RHCP for transmission of Ka-band signals.  An objective capability would add simultaneous transmission of two carriers, one each at LHCP and RHCP, in the Ka-band coverage of the feed.  SPAWAR seeks information on state-of-the-art simultaneous X/K/Ka feeds with the capabilities described above. C/Ku Feed The terminal shall have a feed system capable of supporting simultaneous communications with at least one full duplex carrier in the non-Government C-band and at least one full duplex carrier in the non-Government Ku-band. The threshold frequency coverage is as follows; C: 3.7-4.2 GHz space-to-Earth, 5.850-6.425 GHz Earth-to-space; Ku: 10.70-12.75 GHz space-to-Earth, 14.0-14.5 GHz Earth-to-space. An objective C-band capability would extend the space-to-Earth frequency coverage down to 3.4 GHz and the Earth-to-Space frequency coverage up to 6.65 GHz.  An objective Ku-band capability would extend the Earth-to-Space frequency coverage down to 13.75 GHz. "As a threshold requirement, the feed system shall provide selectable RHCP and LHCP for reception of C-band and Ku-band signals and selectable LHCP and RHCP for transmission of C-band and Ku-band signals. An objective capability would provide simultaneous RHCP and LHCP for reception of C-band and Ku-band signals and simultaneous LHCP and RHCP for transmission of C-band and Ku-band signals.  The feed system shall also be re-configurable to support the reception and transmission of linearly polarized signals in the C- and Ku-bands, providing as a threshold requirement selectable vertical and horizontal polarizations.  An objective linear polarization capability would provide simultaneous vertical and horizontal polarizations to support the reception and transmission of C-band signals.  The feed system shall provide electronic or electromechanical means for rotating the linear polarization orientation of the C- and Ku-band feeds over +/- 90 degrees to maintain alignment with the linear polarization of the received signal(s).  SPAWAR seeks information on state-of-the-art simultaneous C/Ku feeds with the capabilities described above. Wideband Radome To simplify logistics, SPAWAR prefers to procure radomes with a single attenuation versus frequency characteristic for every antenna, regardless if the antenna is outfitted with the simultaneous X/K/Ka feed or the simultaneous C/Ku feed.  Therefore the desired radomes shall provide attenuation less than 2 dB in all frequency bands of interest between 3.7 GHz and 31 GHz.  However, the smallest of the four radomes, the one for the nominal 38? diameter antenna, need not provide for  C-band.  All radome sizes shall be capable of surviving the rigors of the warship topside environment, which include ice loading (up to 4.5 pounds per square foot), salt atmosphere, ship motion forces, gun and missile blast pressure fields, shock, vibration, wind loading, blowing sand and dust, and exposure to solar radiation (causing temperature elevation to 65 degrees Celsius within the radome).  The moisture seals of the radome must keep the enclosed antenna and other equipment dry in all environmental service conditions. Low Radar Cross Section Considering that the radome will be largely transparent across a significant portion of the threat bands, the antenna pedestal and reflector must have provisions for yielding a low radar cross section (RCS). Nonetheless, radome shape will also contribute to the RCS of the topside antenna groups.  SPAWAR seeks information on state-of-the-art design concepts for reducing the RCS of topside antennas. Methods for Antenna Remoting With its four antenna size variants, the AN/WSC-6(V)XX will see service on virtually all US Navy and Military Sealift Command (MSC) surface ship classes.  On some of the larger ship classes, the cable run distances from the below decks equipment group to the topside antennas can be quite large. Therefore, the AN/WSC-6(V)XX will require the capability to support cable run distances up to 450 feet in length.  SPAWAR seeks information on a variety shipboard SATCOM terminal design concepts that would allow such antenna remoting.  Applicable concepts can include the use of fiber optics (a desirable solution, if practicable) for some signals, the placing of miniaturized system components (e.g., frequency converters, antenna controllers and high power amplifiers) at the antenna rather than in the below decks rack(s), and other techniques. Modem-Independent Dual Antenna Handover System (DAHS) In order to maximize commonality with the other Armed Services, SPAWAR envisions that the AN/WSC-6(V)XX would use a Joint external modem that does not necessarily contain provisions for antenna handover (e.g., the EBEM mentioned above).  Therefore, the AN/WSC-6(V)XX BCI preserving antenna handover technique shall operate independently of the modem.  The AN/WSC-6(V)XX Dual Antenna Handover System (DAHS) shall mitigate SATCOM disruptions caused by antenna handover switching when the AN/WSC-6(V)XX operates at full-duplex data rates from 64 kilobits per second to at least 24 megabits per second, with an objective maximum of 40 megabits per second.  The DAHS shall maintain full-duplex communications with full BCI during handover interruptions of up to 80 ms on the ship-to-shore link, and up to 1 ms on the shore-to-ship link.  Considering that shipboard SATCOM antennas are often separated by large physical distances, the DAHS must also accommodate satellite-to-modem path length changes up to at least +/- 900 feet during the handover event.  (The maximum path length difference is calculated by adding the physical separation, in air, between the two topside antennas to the difference in the signal cable run lengths from the antennas to the below decks equipment.)   The DAHS may require hardware both aboard the ship and at the corresponding shore terminal; however, SPAWAR prefers approaches that require DAHS hardware aboard the ship only. In either case, the DAHS will be separate from the shipboard and shore SATCOM terminal modems and not require modification of either modem.  The DAHS may operate on either side of the modem, that is, on the modulated RF waveform (perhaps at an intermediate frequency [IF]) or on the demodulated baseband bit stream.  DAHS approaches that require a dedicated modem or beacon receiver for each shipboard antenna will be considered.  The DAHS will not degrade bit error rate (BER) performance when the time between handover events is greater than or equal to 15 seconds, with an objective of maintaining non-degraded BER performance when handover events occur as frequently as once every 10 seconds.  SPAWAR seeks information on techniques for implementing a DAHS as described above. PACKET SWITCHED CAPABILITY The AN/WSC-6(V)XX shall be capable of accommodating the planned packet switched capability of future WGS satellites.  This capability can be included with all terminals as a base capability or added when WGS implements packet switching. WEB-ENABLEMENT The AN/WSC-6(V)XX shall be capable of both local and remote terminal control and diagnostics for operation, maintenance, and technical assistance.  This terminal control should be capable from a computer on the shipboard IT-21 LAN or from a computer ashore on the SIPRnet.  The terminal should be capable of being fully incorporated into the Navy?s FORCEnet architecture. Responses White papers are requested from interested organizations describing your satellite communications experience and AN/WSC-6(V)XX concepts and technologies.  White papers in Microsoft Word for Office 2000 compatible format are due no later than 27 November 2002.  Responses shall be submitted via e-mail only to sandra.jones@navy.mil.  Interested parties must limit their electronic response to no more than thirty (30) pages.

<SUBJECT>66 -- High Cycle Fatigue Test System-Release of Draft PBSOW for Industry Comments
<DESC>The Propulsion Systems Evaluation Facility (PSEF), at the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division in Patuxent River, MD is responsible for conducting test and evaluation of fan, compressor and hot section rotating components used in military gas turbine engines to determine life-limiting characteristics.  The PSEF?s Rotor Spin Facility (RSF)  has been designated a Department of Defense Center of Excellence for spin testing of military gas turbine engine components.  Current test capability of the RSF is limited to the determination of low cycle fatigue impact on life expectancy of rotating components. The use of advance aerodynamic designs and materials in high performance engines has increased the risk of High Cycle Fatigue (HCF) failures.  Successful completions of a number of Government contracts and independent corporate research efforts have demonstrated the capability to provide dynamic excitation of gas turbine airfoils to fatigue levels in a vacuum spin chamber.  Concurrent with the development of the excitation system has been the development of a Non-intrusive Stress Measurement System to measure very small amplitudes of all the airfoils of the rotor while rotating at high speeds.  With these advancements, it is now possible to assemble a system capable of simulating a stress environment in a vacuum spin chamber, measuring rotor/airfoil stresses and assessing the effects of these stresses on component life with respect to high cycle fatigue at conditions simulating the rotor?s operating environment.  The Navy at Patuxent River would like to take advantage of these technological advances to procure a High Cycle Fatigue Test System.  Our objective is to obtain a state-of-the-art High Cycle Fatigue Test System using proven technological capabilities.  This is not a request for competitive proposals.  Currently we have a draft Performance Based Statement of Work (PBSOW) for this requirement and are looking for comments from experts in this field.  In addition, please provide a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost for the High Cycle Fatigue System as you understand it from the PBSOW.  It is understood that this ROM has an accuracy of +/-30% and will only be used for budgetary purposes.  A draft of the PBSOW can be obtained for review, comments and suggestions by contacting Ms. Rachel Luther via phone (301) 757-9711, fax (301) 757-0200, or e-mail lutherrn@navair.navy.mil or through the NAVAIR Solicitation page at http://www.navair.navy.mil/business/ecommerce/index.cfm under N00421-02-T-0129.  Comments and suggestions are due in writing by 02 August 2002.  They should be forwarded by mail to: Contracts, Attn: Rachel Luther ? 251717 Bldg 588 S2, Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, 47253 Whalen Rd Unit 9, Patuxent River MD 20670-1463; by e-mail to lutherrn@navair.navy.mil; OR by fax to (301) 757-0200.  This draft PBSOW does not obligate the Government to award a contract for a High Cycle Fatigue Test System nor does this letter authorize you to bill the Government for your review and comments on our draft requirement.

<SUBJECT>A -- DMSP Future Meteorological Satellite (METSAT) Architecture - Industry Day and Request for Information
<DESC>This solicitation for information is for planning purposes only, in accordance with the FAR Clause 52.215-3.  The Request for Information (RFI) initiated herein is an Exploratory Development and preparation of material by contractors to respond to this RFI will not be funded by the government.  The Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) System Program Office (SPO) is seeking concept solutions and Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost estimates for the future architecture for receipt, processing, display, and routing of real-time METSAT data.  The proposed solutions and cost estimates should show the architecture migration from the current systems to the NPOESS era over the next 10 years.  The intent is to provide a light, lean, and responsive capability to exploit all channels of METSAT imagery from foreign and domestic geostationary and polar-orbiting meteorological satellites.  Compatibility with existing systems, processes, servers, and terminals in effect today is required at the start of the migration.  Interoperability with weather subsystems is a key performance consideration.  The subsystems at the Operational Weather Squadrons (OWS) and Combat Weather Teams (CWT) include the OWS Production System (OPS II) and the New Tactical Forecast System (N-TFS).  The solution will support a decentralized regional architecture, while providing worldwide coverage, driven by changes in the world conditions and advances in communications technology.  It will also reduce the forward-deployed footprint by minimizing the number of required direct readout terminal systems and having a common user interface.  Achieving a secure environment for data transmission, reception, storage, and distribution is of primary importance.  The Government seeks sources with system level experience to supply information describing potential hardware and software solutions.  The design attributes should include an emphasis on the sustainability, life cycle cost, interoperability, interface with strategic and tactical battlefield systems, transportability, reliability, maintainability, supportability, readily accessible components and no single-point failures.  Communications solutions to distribute products from a regional Operations Weather Squadron (OWS) capable of receiving multiple satellite systems including X-Band High Rate Data (HRD) should be optimized to reduce reliance on portable downlink systems.  In September 2001, the NPOESS IPO issued an RFI for field terminals in the NPOESS era.  Though similar in nature, this RFI is broader in scope: it expands upon the previous effort, considers the transition from the current systems architecture to the end state, and encompasses all functional aspects of METSAT data consumption, to include collection (ingest)/data processing, analysis/product tailoring, and dissemination.  An Industry Brief will be held to provide an overview of the requirements on 24 Oct 2002 between 0800-1600 at Aerospace Corporation, Bldg A3, Room 1607, A/B, 2330 East El Segundo Blvd, El Segundo, CA, 90245.  An opportunity for one-on-one sessions with the government will be provided.  Interested parties must complete a registration form via fax (310) 336-4364 or e-mail robert.Donovan@losangeles.af.mil NLT 17 Oct 2002.  Current capabilities include the Small Tactical Terminal, Mark IVB Meteorological Data Station and Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA) central processing facility data generation and exchange capabilities.  These systems currently ingest, store, and process meteorological data from all current polar-orbiting and geostationary satellites.  The NPOESS is the next generation polar-orbiting environmental satellite that will replace the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite (POES) and Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) satellites approximately 2008-9.  The current field terminals used throughout the Department of Defense (DoD), Department of Commerce (DOC), and worldwide civilian community are not capable of receiving the data provided by NPOESS in their current configurations.  In addition, some terminals will be reaching end of life prior to and during the fielding of NPOESS.  Contractors may identify innovative hardware or data ingest solutions, and may also incorporate any part of existing systems as part of their architecture in the RFI.  All components in the delivered architecture must be consistent with and an integral part of operational, technical and system views of the current Air Force Weather (AFW) architecture. These components must also be in compliance with Joint Technical Architecture (JTA) standards. Specific JTA information can be obtained from the following websites: http://www-jta.itsi.disa.mil/. Terminals will be fully interoperable with DoD and non-DoD systems (e.g., Defense Information Infrastructure - Common Operational Environment) and will have the capability to be networked worldwide.  The goal is to ensure a fully open architecture from today's operational systems through to future systems.  Submittals:  Potential system providers are invited to respond to any or all parts of this RFI.  Pertinent information can be found at the following website: http://www.losangeles.af.mil/smc/ci/ind/index.htm.  Respondents are also requested to e-mail the Point of Contact (POC) of their intent to respond.  1Lt Robert Donovan, program management POC, can be e-mailed at robert.donovan@losangeles.af.mil.  Prepare a budgetary ROM and basis of estimate for this development.  Your solution should include an architecture migration from current capability through the NPOESS era.   Identify your proposed software and hardware.  Supply your pertinent company information, including contact person, phone number, and email address.  Responses should not be restrictive and all proprietary information should be identified. Proprietary information will be protected and will not be divulged unless mandated by existing laws.  In accordance with FAR 52.215-3 entitled "Solicitation for Information or Planning Purposes (Oct 1997)", it states, "The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to pay for information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulations."  Respondents to this RFI are invited to submit comments on the Government's proposed requirements, or alternately recommend approaches that will satisfy the Government's overall goals of procuring an open architecture. Interested firms are requested to submit any comments and suggestions on the preliminary documents and their capability statements to the address cited above.  Pages should be printed on 8 and 1/2 x 11-inch paper, with type no smaller than 12 point. Figures, tables and charts are not limited to 8 and 1/2 x 11, but must be folded to that size. 
Submit two paper copies and one electronic media copy on 5 inch CD-ROM using MS Office 2000 version of Microsoft WORD, Excel, or PowerPoint.   The responses should be concise and direct.  Any peripheral data on unrelated programs, or excess corporate or marketing data is not desired.  Please also include information on the response title, the lead organization responding, the type of business, and contact points for members of the technical and business team.  This RFI is for information and planning purposes only, and should no be construed as a Request for Proposal (RFP) or solicitation of an offer.  The response to the RFI shall be submitted no later than 25 November 2002 between 0800-1500 hours to SMC/CIK, 2420 Vela way Suite 1467-A8, El Segundo, CA, 90245, Attention:  Ms Jo Ann Takayama Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO).  Refer any questions regarding the Industry Brief to 1Lt Robert Donovan, program management POC, to robert.donovan@losangeles.af.mil.
