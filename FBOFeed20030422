<DESC>NASA/LaRC plans to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) to procure a 3 dimensional (3-D)Fused Deposition Modeling Fabricator (FDM Titan Modeler)to create 3-D models made of polycarbonate or polyphenylsulfone materials. Metal castings of models will not satisfy this requirement. The modeling fabricator will be used at NASA LaRC to create models.	This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP)under FAR Part 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from Stratasys,Inc., which is the only responsible source and no other supplies or service will satisfy the agency requirements. Only the FDM Titan Modeler uses polycarbonate and polyphenylsulfone materials to create 3-D models, no other company manufactures a system that creates models using polycarbonate or polyphenylsulfone materials. The FDM Titan Modeler machine uses unique, patented technologies that have not been licensed to any other manufacturer. Although other manufacturers have processes for producing models using other materials such as cast metals (aluminum, and copper), acrylic polymers or wax, there is no other machine that uses polycarbonate or polyphenylsulfone material to develop the type of models NASA LaRC requires.  NASA LaRC is not seeking businesses who perform modeling services; it is only interested in procuring the modeling equipment. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on April 30, 2003.  Respondents shall clearly state whether or not thier proposed equipment is capable of creating models using polycarbonate and polyphenylsulfone materials.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.   An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT), Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) , Department of Health and Human Services contemplates awarding a one year cost reimbursement contract with four option years.  This solicitation is issued under Full and Open Competition.  SAMHSA, as are all Federal agencies, is required by the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) to develop and monitor performance measures so that it can demonstrate accountability for all of its programs.  CSAT must ensure that its varying activities support and are integrated with the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) and SAMHSA strategies, performance measurement systems, and long-term programmatic plans.

The purpose of this contract is to consolidate GPRA reporting and related activities for CSAT’s entire discretionary program under one umbrella; these are currently spread across multiple CSAT Technical Assistance and GPRA contracts.  This contract for the Services Accountability Improvement System (SAIS) will provide funding to cover GPRA activities for all CSAT discretionary programs, specifically for use in conducting accountability and performance assessments of these programs, making such information available to CSAT Project Officers for improved project oversight and CSAT management for improved staff and grantee portfolio oversight.  In addition, the contract will provide support for the delivery of training and technical assistance to grantees on the collection of GPRA data, serving as a data entry point for GPRA data collection as well as a data repository.  The Services Accountability Improvement System will provide additional support for GPRA and CSAT accountability and management activities, separate from grantees’ programmatic funding, and will ensure a coordinated focus on GPRA, performance monitoring and accountability data, across all discretionary grant programs.  It is expected that improved funding availability will lead to more, and better data on programs and potentially will contribute to standardization of key data elements across all CSAT discretionary programs.  Specifically, CSAT will have, at a minimum, the capacity to report for all CSAT programs on:  Particular populations served, numbers of people served, types and locations of particular activities supported, effectiveness across programs for particular populations, the characteristics and effectiveness across programs of activities relative to national, subpopulation and geographic area data and trends.  The estimated date for issuance of this RFP is May  8, 2003 with proposal responses due June  9, 2003.  This solicitation may be obtained in any of three ways; by mail; picked up in person at 5515 Security Lane, Suite 640, Rockville, MD 20852; or, electronically at the SAMHSA web site: http:/samhsa.gov/contracts.  Files will not be made available on the Web Site until after the estimated issuance date.  If you have a continuing interest in the RFP, notify the individual identified below that you wish copies of amendments to the RFP (if any) sent to you, or check the Web Site regularly for amendments which will also be posted there.  Note: If you rely on the Web Site for obtaining amendments, SAMHSA has no way to assure, and therefore assumes no responsibility for assuring you have downloaded these amendments.  Requests for copies of the RFP must be made in writing.  Requests will be filled on a first-come, first-served basis until the supply is exhausted; however, there is no assurance that copies requested after the twentieth day will reach the requestor before the due date for receipt of responses. Requests shall be forwarded to the attention of Matt Johnson, Contract Specialist, Division of Contracts Management, OPS, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Rockwall II Building, Room 640, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Maryland 20857.  Requests may be sent via fax to (301)594-0535.  Electronic mail and telephone requests will not be honored.  * * * * *

STATEMENT OF WORK: INTRODUCTION: GIT III is a Minerals Management Service (MMS) initiative to continue and extend the use of Geological Interpretive Tools (GIT). GIT are commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) geoscience, geophysical and engineering software applications focused in Petroleum Exploration and Production analysis. The MMS, a bureau in the U.S. Department of the Interior, is the federal agency that manages the nation's natural gas, oil and other mineral resources on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). The agency includes two major programs, Offshore Minerals Management (OMM) and Minerals Revenue Management. OMM, which manages the mineral resources on the OCS, comprises three regions: Alaska, Gulf of Mexico, and the Pacific. GIT is a critical technology for OMM. GIT provides the ability to automate mission critical assessments, including: Fair value determinations, field determinations, reserves inventory, G&G permits, chemosynthetics and gas hydrates analysis, royalty relief, unitization, reservoir analysis conservation, rate control volumetrics determination, shallow hazards and environmental assessments. GIT ensures that the MMS has the capability perform sophisticated analysis of 3-D seismic, depth migrated data and other highly technical data using state-of-the-art interpretation techniques and technologies similar to those employed by the Petroleum Industry. The MMS must keep pace with the changing technology used by industry to ensure proper decisions for mission critical functions which allows for timely lease sale evaluations which industry expects. CONTRACT OBJECTIVES: The MMS is looking to leverage existing investments in GIT hardware infrastructure, software and training. The OMM has invested heavily in existing GIT software through both direct costs and indirect cost. Critical data is stored in existing software application database formats and workflows have been developed around these existing project data stores. The cost of migrating data to new project database solutions would be high in the short term. Furthermore, OMM geoscientists and engineers have achieved a high level of proficiency in these applications. Key existing software applications are: GeoFrame from Schlumberger, IESX by, CPS-3 from Schlumberger, WellPix by Schlumberger, Stratimagic from Paradigm and LCTseis from Fugro-LCT. The implementation and use of the key software components has provided increased productivity and improvements to OMM work processes. A primary objective of a new contract is to provide access to critical new technologies that will provide a new step increase in productivity. Another goal is for the OMM to achieve more flexibility to manage all software licenses. The flexibility includes the ability to reorganize the existing portfolio of software applications as well as adding different licensing options. To achieve these goals the MMS is seeking options on WAN pricing, leasing options and ASP service options, as well as license remix options where the MMS can trade licenses for credits to be used to acquire newer technologies. The MMS would like an option to set aside a percentage of the yearly maintenance for software development that focuses on MMS needs or initiatives. SCOPE: The scope encompasses all technologies used in an E&P environment, including software, documentation, training, support and services that can allow the OMM geoscientist or engineer to meet the objectives of their mission described above. SOFTWARE: The software functionality required by the original GIT contract was divided into geophysical analysis, petrophysical analysis, reservoir analysis, interactive mapping and geographic information systems. GIT II leveraged the original investment and expanded the software functionality to include visualization, gravity and magnetic modeling, velocity modeling, stratigraphic analysis and 3-D geological modeling. GIT III will leverage the existing information technology developed to support GIT. The currently identified solution categories are: AVO ANALYSIS: Software in this category will be used to estimate the lithology and fluid content or reservoir rocks using the analysis of seismic amplitude variations with offset. Software that generates impedance data will also be considered under this category. DATA MANAGEMENT: The data management requirements include: data audit records management, database reconciliation, data rationalization, digital data archive and storage database maintenance. The data managed are E&P data including: seismic data (both 2-D and 3-D time and depth migrated data) in both SEG-Y format and in GeoFrame project format, well logs in LAS and TIFF, velocity models in ASCII format, GeoFrame interpretation project data (horizons, markers, grids, etc.), and CGM and other image file outputs. Applications should provide the means to view, quality check, clean, and load the data, collect and catalog meta-data, store the meta-data, archive the data and allow retrieval of the archived data. A web browser tool and a map interface should be provided for users to view archived or available on-line data and provide a means to access the data. GEOLOGY: Provide detailed geological analysis of the near-well area and well-to-well interpretation and correlation. Types of analysis include well top picks, correlations, cross-section generation, zone identification, lithology classification, facies classifications and dip and image interpretation. Log display and editing can also be accomplished. Display capabilities and function capabilities should be both single and multi-well. GEOLOGIC MODELING: This category covers a wide range of needs for the OMM from 3-D geological modeling structural modeling and restoration, and basin maturity and oil migration modeling. GEOSTATISTICS: The requirements are to provide krieging, cokriging and simulation capabilities to analyze and compare geological and geophysical data to extract statistical relationships in the data. GRAVITY/MAGNETICS: The software must model gravity and magnetic data to compare and verify seismic interpretations. The software must closely integrate with OMM seismic data sets. INTEGRATION: Integration provides users access to all data and information needed to perform their work in their application of choice either through data transfer or translation.  Integration includes publishing information back to the master data store. The integration software should provide options for filtering data and quality checking data during the integration process. KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT: Knowledge management software should allow geoscientists and engineers to capture knowledge, share information, create reports and collaborate online. Workflow and decision processes of projects should be easily captured and preserved. MAPPING AND GRIDDING: Maps and grids are a primary output mechanism for virtually all data generated. There must be a strong integration with all software disciplines. This module must contain a full complement of quality mapping functionality including coordinate geometry (COGO), projection, datum, spheroid, and scale functions. Accurate and conditionally sound gridding and contouring of horizon tops and bases, isopachs, and all seismic attributes are required. PETROPHYSICAL ANALYSIS: The component requires the capabilities to load industry standard well log formats, edit raw curve data, and environmentally correct and analyze data. A variety of porosity, water saturation, resistivity and shale volume calculations are necessary to realistically define reservoir limits. These analyses must include deterministic, probabilistic and multi-mineral methods of analysis. RISK AND VALUE: The OMM undertakes probabilistic play analysis, economically recoverable reserves estimates, and economically recoverable resources. The resource economic value of tracts offered for lease is determined by calculating the amount of economically recoverable resources, estimating cost recovery factors, production profiles, exploration and development costs, operating costs, revenue streams, and performing discounted cash-flow analysis. Computer simulation modeling incorporating geologic and economic risk is performed to accomplish this task. RESERVOIR ENGINEERING: Analytical tools are required to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze oil and gas reservoirs. In order to evaluate the reservoirs' current production capability and its expected ultimate recoverable hydrocarbons, decline curve analyses, of several types, will be performed. Pressure and temperature studies with well performance tests, reservoir pressure and temperature, relative permeability and capillary pressure, porosity and water saturation will be used to evaluate individual well cumulative production potential and the reservoir's production potential over its expected lifetime. Quantitative economic analyses of the production rates, in conjunction with other test results, will be used to determine ultimate dollar return for the reservoir to the operator and government. RESERVOIR PROPERTIES: Mapping log properties to seismic data and seismic attribute analysis to determine reservoir property extent. RESERVOIR SIMULATION: Black oil and compositional simulation that includes gridding and preparation routines to get models ready for simulation. SEISMIC DATA PROCESSING: Software to manipulate and change seismic data from field orientated data into interpretation-ready quality data. Processing includes: demultiplexing, gain recovery, amplitude analysis, wavelet shaping, deconvolution, statistics analysis, velocity analysis, normal moveout correction, mute, stack, filtering, and migration. SEISMIC INTERPRETATION: The use of interpretation techniques to evaluate 2-D, 3-D, 4C, depth and other potential types of seismic data collected to evaluate the hydrocarbon potential of the subsurface. SEISMIC MODELING: The OMM uses seismic forward modeling to determine if a survey accurately images an objective target and to test and validate seismic structural and attribute interpretations. OMM requires both 2-D and 3-D forward seismic modeling capabilities and illumination analysis. STRATIGRAPHIC ANALYSIS: The OMM uses seismic facies and neural network technology to determine subtle reservoir characteristics by mapping seismic character and assessing the variation in signal shape over an interval of interest (e. g. reservoir). The result is a color classified facies model that represent seismic data heterogeneity. Classification maps are then computed to show the distribution of seismic facies. VELOCITY MODELING: The OMM requires post-stack velocity modeling capabilities to provide interactive time to depth conversion of horizons or seismic data sets to generate velocity models to determine the reasonableness of acquired depth migrated data. VISUALIZATION: The OMM requires a multi-platform 3-D canvas to integrate interpretations from the other GIT applications and interpret all data. This data includes, but is not limited to, wells, well paths, velocity data, seismic data, well log data, horizon data, markers, grids, faults, etc. The visualization software should be a scalable solution and be able to handle multi-attribute volumes, multiple 3-D volumes and volumes of any size. SOFTWARE COMPATIBILITY: The functionality of the software acquired through GIT III must be compatible with OMM systems architecture. The current system environment utilizes client/server architecture with SUN Server 2000's, Auspex and Network Appliance servers, SUN workstations running Solaris 8 and personal computers running Windows 2000. Both a local area network (LAN) and a wide area network (WAN) are employed. The architecture uses on-line and near-line data storage in a combination SAN and NAS configuration. Plotting is done through ZEH software. As technology changes, the system architecture may also change. All software must maintain compatibility with changes in the OMM system architecture throughout the life of the contract. Data is stored using the master data/project level data store concept. The master data store is an Oracle-based relational database that consists of TIMS, an internally developed data model, and Finder. The data is currently moved via GeoShare from the master store to the project applications. As new technologies are acquired, compatibility between the software applications becomes a concern. To try to maintain software compatibility, the software should adhere to industry standards. The following are the minimum standards that effect this proposal: Petroleum Open Software Corporation (POSC), Public Petroleum Data Model (PPDM), OpenGIS (Open GIS Consortium) and GeoShare. DOCUMENTATION: One copy per license of appropriate documentation, including a programmer guide, quick reference guide, technical reference manual and on-line help should be provided written in plain English. TRAINING: Multiple training options are required to support the OMM train-the-trainer system. The training options available to OMM should not be limited to standard training at the vendor site teaching basic software use. The OMM requires on-site training option at its own training facilities. These facilities allow for 12 people per training session. OMM requires system level training, project level, and user training that uses OMM workflows and OMM data. SUPPORT: OMM requires the following support options: Technical support via telephone as needed, technical support via on site visits to MMS as needed, technical support via facsimile screen dumps as needed, technical support via user support groups as needed, technical support via remote system operation as needed, and technical support via on line context sensitive help as needed. MAINTENANCE: Software maintenance will provide the OMM both with new software version upgrades and the latest software corrections modifications and fixes. New software versions, patches or releases generated with the latest corrections will be provided to the OMM in a timely fashion, i.e., the same time the corrections are made available to any other software client. The OMM will receive the initial three months of maintenance as a warranty for the software to ensure that the software is acceptable for OMM use. At any time during this 3-month period, the software can be returned for a full refund. The OMM requires the ability to transfer licenses to other regions without penalty. Software bugs or problems reported by the OMM to the software vendor should be dealt with in a timely and efficient manner. Within 24 hours of notifying the vendor of a problem, the OMM will receive a report indicating the status of the problem and a time frame for problem resolution. The OMM will have the option to assign a mission critical status to issues. A procedure will be established between OMM and the vendor to ensure that OMM problems are dealt with to OMM's satisfaction.  SERVICES: Services include, but are not limited to, on-site support and guidance. Typical on-site support services include software installation, project upgrades, and workflow analysis. Additional services include participation in an on-line exploration and production marketplace or business, the use of an application service provider, or the storage and management of data.

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) intends to procure approximately 1000 Optical Stripe Reader/Writers and Biometrics Verification Systems for deployment to the ports of entry.  These systems will enable the DHS to read, and authenticate the biometrics encoded in the optical stripe of the Border Crossing Card (BCC) and display the encoded data of the Permanent Resident Card (PRC).  The offeror(s) selected must be able to provide an initial deployment of 200 units of the required hardware and software to DHS by no later than 30 days of the award.  The remaining 800 units shall be delivered in increments of 200 or more per month thereafter until delivery is complete.

The reader/writers and verification systems must run on existing DHS platforms (Dell 2.26 Ghz Pentium 4 or similar workstations) using Windows 2000, with Universal Serial Bus (USB) Port and a Cross Match fingerprint capture device. Software and peripherals cannot interrupt other peripheral devices, which currently reside on the workstations. The viability/efficacy of these reader/writers will ultimately be determined through DHS tests conducted at ICE Headquarters.

The Optical Reader/Writers and Biometrics Verification Systems must read the BCC and other legacy INS optical stripe card stock as rapidly as possible, systems will be evaluated for time, and be able to record data onto the optical stripe portion of the card.  Systems must rapidly authenticate the biometrics of the BCC and presenter and display the results, identify expired, fraudulent, and counterfeit documents.  The system shall display transactions and verifications in a user-friendly format, and store images and information obtained from scanning the PRC and BCC to include the card presenter.

Systems must indicate when the system has made the biometrics match and identify or has encountered an impostor.  The systems must be able to write onto the optical stripe and display such notes, when present, upon initial read and be available to print comparison images of the fingerprints, photos, and signatures of documents and candidate in both color and black and white.  The Optical Reader/Writers and Biometrics Verification Systems shall be robust systems, which operate in several climatic and inspectional environments, and under extreme use. 

The DHS requires a reader/writer, software and required peripheral with the ability to make biometrics verification.  Most BCCs have two Cogent® minutiae encoded on the optical stripe portion of the card.  If a positive match is not accomplished on the first finger searched, the system should read the other minutia on the card and make a comparison and results should be displayed on the screen.

The DHS will select a source or sources that offer the best value, price and other factors considered. The DHS reserves the right to award a contract to one or more sources. 

Interested vendors capable of meeting these requirements shall formally express their interest, request copies of the formal solicitation from DHS, and provide marketing information to DHS regarding their respective readers/writers (not to exceed 20 pages) to the undersigned contract specialist by May 5, 2003. Interested vendors must identify whether or not they hold current Federal Supply Schedule contracts with the General Services Administration (GSA), and specify the pertinent Schedules and contract numbers under which their reader/writers may be procured. Responses to this announcement are not offers and cannot be accepted to form a binding contract.  No cost data should be submitted, except in accordance with the solicitation which is available from the contract specialist named below. 
 
Materials submitted will not be returned to the senders.  All expressions of interests, requests for copies of the solicitation, marketing information, and inquiries along with a valid E-mail address shall be directed to DHS contract specialist, Joseph Spencer, Room 2208, Chester A. Arthur Building, Headquarters Procurement Division, Department of Homeland Security, 425 I Street, N.W. Washington, D.C. or by E-Mail at Joseph.Spencer@usdoj.gov.

<DESC>NA Furnish all materials, labor, equipment and perform all operations that are necessary to demolish and dispose of two existing concrete guardwall monoliths at Lock and Dam 53, Ohio River (Grand Chain, Illinois) and replace with a driven pile and fabricated steel structure.   The project incorporates the following specialized construction operations:  underwater demolition of approximately 700 cubic yards of reinforced concrete without the use of explosives; lifting and driving four ten-foot diameter steel ca sings, each weighing approximately 24 tons, at a radius of no less than 35 feet; shop fabrication and field installation of two structural steel impact walls, totaling approximately 74 tons; driving of approximately 120 PZ-27 heavy sheet piles in two 90-fo ot long parallel alignments; placement of approximately 350 cubic yards of concrete by the underwater tremie method.  Rip rap must be removed from the Ohio River bottom in front of the wall and there is a requirement to dredge several thousand cubic yards of sediment behind the wall.  The 10-foot diameter steel casings and the PZ-27 sheet piling are both Government Furnished Property.  Additionally, the project worksite is accessible only by the Ohio River, there is no roadway access.  Therefore only barge- mounted lifting, pile driving and equipment with concrete batch plant can be utilized on this project.  Another significant factor is that the project site is entirely under water and therefore no work can be performed during approximately 6 to 9 months a year.  The low water season starts in July, therefore a relatively narrow window of opportunity exists for accomplishing this project.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 237990, the SIC code is 1629, size standard is $28.5 m illion, however,  THIS PROCUREMENT IS UNRESTRICTED.   This invitation for bids will be available on the Internet.  Solicitation DACW27-03-B-0001 will be available on the website approximately 07 May 2003, and bid opening will be 05 June 2003 at 1:00 p.m. ( local time).  Project files are Portable Document Format (PDF) files and can be viewed, navigated, or printed using Adobe Acrobat Reader.   Interested offerors MUST register through the Louisville District homepage at http://www.ebs.lrl.usace.army.mil.   T elephone requests/faxes will not be honored.  Questions can be addressed to B.J.

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command intends to issue solicitation N00024-03-R-2308 for the accomplishment of Post Shakedown Availabilities (PSA) for DDG 90 (CHAFEE), DDG 92(MOMSEN) and DDG 93 (CHUNG-HOON) with options for the accomplishment of two additional DDG 51 Class PSAs. The PSA encompasses all the manpower, support services, material, non-standard equipment and associated technical data and documents required to prepare for and accomplish the PSA. The work to be accomplished will include correction of Government responsible trial card deficiencies, new work identified between ship custody transfer and the start of PSA and incorporation of approved engineering changes that were not incorporated during the construction period which are not otherwise the building yard’s responsibility under the ship construction contract.  This will also include engineering and management support o f PSA’s, providing effort and material to perform specified work items inclusive of tests and post repair sea trials to complete performance of PSA’s and emergent and other work. Work on all vessels will take place in the ship's homeport area in either Pearl Harbor, HI or Everett, WA.  The five year PSA execution contract will be awarded through a limited competition between BIW and NGSS in order to develop and maintain one shipbuilder’s capability to respond to emergency repair situations in remote ports.  Lessons learned from the near loss of the USS Cole in Yemen after an attack on October 12, 2000 indicated that a quick commercial shipyard response to DDG 51 Class complex battle damage in remote areas is a critical need.  For the DDG 51 class, only BIW and NGSS maintain the requisite design expertise and production experience necessary for this remote capability.  See Numbe red Note 22.

<DESC>This notice announces the intent of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to issue a competitive Request For Proposals (RFP) on or about May 7, 2003, for offers to provide test administration services.  On February 21, 2003, the OPM first announced its intent to conduct a public / private full cost comparison study in accordance with OMB Circular A-76 for test administration services for government customers across the country through its Nationwide Testing Program.  The Testing Program provides test and applicant scheduling, test administration, and test warehousing and distribution services for customers of the OPM.  Through its testing network, OPM has the capability to administer employment and other tests at thousands of locations nationwide, with a commitment to offer any test at any location for their customers.  During FY2002, OPM provided scheduling and test administration services for over 7,000 employment test sessions in hundreds of locations requested by its Federal agency customers.  OPM also conducted approximately 34,000 sessions of the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) for 72 Military Entrance Processing Stations (MEPS) of the U.S. Military Entrance Processing Command.  Of these ASVAB sessions, OPM conducted about 20,000 Enlistment sessions at 564 fixed sites and over 13,000 Student sessions at thousands of high schools throughout the United States.  OPM warehouses and distributes test material to support these sessions through its Denver Service Section (DSS).  The DSS has about six million tests in its inventory and another six million test-related items.  During FY2002, the DSS handled about 15,000 shipments of test material to and from authorized test administrators around the country.  Security of the test material at all times to prevent loss or compromise is an essential part of the services OPM provides to its customers.  OPM’s current customers have chosen to use paper and pencil test in over 99.5 percent of the sessions OPM conducts for them.  They use computer-assisted testing in the remaining 0.5 percent of the sessions.  They do not have internet-based testing.  The objective of this solicitation is to administer the tests as customers have designed them, not to deliver or develop other testing formats (e.g. on-line or computer-assisted testing.).  The current Nationwide Testing Program customer base is subject to change over time.  Because of changes in such things as agency mission, funding, staffing levels, and human capital assessment strategies and techniques, the customer base has changed over time and is subject to change in the future.
This procurement is unrestricted, i.e., it is open for competition to both large and small businesses.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 611710, "Educational Support Services," which has a size standard of $6,000,000 in average annual sales for the three prior years.  The period of performance for any contract that may be awarded is expected to be for a base period of one year, with four one-year, follow-on option periods, per FAR 17.2 - Options.  The contract is expected to be a fixed-price, requirements type contract.  Please note that this notice DOES NOT OBLIGATE THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD ANY CONTRACT. Under the A-76 process, the in-house government organization that is currently performing this work will be allowed to compete against the private sector and other agencies for the referenced work. Accordingly, a contract may or may not be ultimately awarded as a result of the study.  Furthermore, the solicitation will contain solicitation provision, FAR 52.207-2 Notice of Cost Comparison (Negotiated), and the contract clause, 52.207-3 Right of First Refusal of Employment. If a contract is awarded through this study, displaced, permanent Government employees hired by the successful offeror must be provided employee benefits commensurate with those received by Government employees. Any questions concerning this procurement should be submitted to Henry Wong, Contracting Officer, 202-606-1598, e-mail: hlwong@opm.gov.

<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement for a DUPLICATE UNIQUE FUEL INJECTOR. This item will be a duplicate of a Fuel Injector developed & built under the NASA Research & Development Contract NAS3-00143 Task Order #1.  It is anticipated that the original developer & builder will build & deliver the duplicate. NASA/GRC intends to purchase this unique fuel injector from WOODWARD FST, INC., in accordance with the sole source authority granted by FAR 6.302-1 [Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements].  Specifically, this effort requires the original developer/builder to slightly modify its design of its unique fuel injector (which was built to meet the requirements of NAS3-00143 TO#1), and to build & deliver that item to NASA no later than June 30, 2003.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  This item meets the definition of a commercial item, because the developer/builder has a history designing/building this specific item.	If any other entity were to attempt to duplicate this item, the government would consider it a non-commercial item. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION.  A COMPETITIVE SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED PURSUANT TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. If an organization wishes to, it may submit its capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing (preferably, via e-mail) to the Contracting Officer not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on May 12, 2003; such communication shall include the organization's explanation of how it intends to accomplish a duplication/modification of the unique Woodward design/build within the time frame (delivery date of June 30, 2003).	Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated SOLELY for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  If the Government does decide to compete this effort, another synopsis will be issued & a competitive solicitation will then be posted.  However, at this time, the Government anticipates that this will be a non-competitive acquisition and no competitive solicitation will be available. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice -- Please e-mail any responses/comments/inquiries to the Contracting Officer no later than May 12, 2003. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<DESC>The National Library of Medicine intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the University of Pennsylvania under the authority of FAR 6.302.  The University of Pennsylvania currently has a two-year contract (N01-LM-1-3541) to develop and assess a computerized educational game, Heart Sense, for potential heart attack victims. The goal was to take advantage of the attractions of video-gaming to involve such patients in a game that would educate in an interesting way about heart disease, its symptoms, and the appropriate timely response in order to take advantage of the best therapeutic interventions, with emphasis on the administration of reperfusion therapy (thrombolysis).  The contractor made substantial progress in the work with development of an attractive product that was well received in early evaluations. The field of edutainment interventions is brand new. It promises a novel way to conduct health promotion and education of the public. A major impediment to the field is that there is no widely available generator for producing interventions. NLM now intends grant the University of Pennsylvania a one-year no-cost extension to use the production system for the Heart Sense Game as a basis for producing an environment that the laity can use for writing new interventions in a variety of clinical conditions. It is anticipated that 9 months will be spent in this effort to convert Heart Sense into a game generator. Another 3 months will be used to test the generator, first with student writers, and then with actual health promotion professionals in the Medical complex at University of Pennsylvania. Because the University of Pennsylvania is the inventor of Heart Sense, they are the only source that can develop new interventions to their product.  Introducing a new contractor, who would have to redevelop the structures now in place, would add materially in time and cost.  This notice of intent, therefore, is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the National Library of Medicine.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke (NINDS) intends to procure sample analysis studies involving Idebenone and QS-10 from MDS Pharma Services, 621 Rose Street, Lincoln, Nebraska 68502  The NINDS is conducting a Phase l dose escalation trial of Idebenone in patients with Friedreich’s ataxia.  The doses under study range from 2.5 mg/kg to 75 mg/kg.  At the high end, this is several fold higher than delivered to humans previously, and an important component of this trial is determining the pharmacokinetic profile of high dose Iodebenone and its major metabolite QS-10.  Under a previous NIH study, MDS Pharma Services obtained the reference material from Takeda Pharmaceuticals (the original developer of the drug), and utilizing a protocol established by Takeda, developed a validated method for Idebenone and QS-10 in human plasma according to Good Laboratory Practice methods accepted by the Food and Drug Administration.   Under this new procurement, MDS Pharma Services will analyze Idebenone and QS-10 on samples from approximately 80 patients utilizing methods validated and accepted by the FDA Industry Guidance for Method Development and Validation of methods for the measurement of drugs in biological matrices.  As the only organization with a validated method for Idebenone and QS-10 in human plasma, MDS Pharmaca Services is uniquely qualified to perform this study.  This procurement is commercial as defined in FAR Part 2, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR 13.5.  This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a capability statement.  This statement must demonstrate that the analysis methods proposed have been validated in accordance with FDA standards, and utilize the protocol established by the Takeda Pharmaceuticals.  This information must be furnished in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to permit the NINDS to determine if the party meets the requirement.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the contracting office, by 1 PM EDT on April 28, 2003.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or sent via e-mail to dm170b@nih.gov.  It is the vendor’s responsibility to ensure that all questions are received by the Government via fax or e-mail.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received in response to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This is Amendment No. 002 to the combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice under Request for Quotation No. 03-SQ-34-0128 which incorporates all provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular No. 2001-12.  This amendment answers questions which were received regarding the requirement and provide clarification on the requirement.  Clarification of the  Requirement - The Contractor shall provide the following items under this Request for Quotatio: Six (6) 18-inch Diameter high performance wafer style butterfly valves, including actuators, mounting plates, and incidentals meeting the requirements of the Requirement Specifications.  Three (3) Actuators for Class 300, 18-inch Alfa Laval (Lug type) valves with metal seats, Model Number MYPH11400.  No torque values or other paperwork are available on the existing valves.  Based on the information, available for the Tricentric valves, the seating/unseating torques would have to be a minimum 35,000 inch pounds. Two (2) - Actuators for Class 300, 18-inch Tricentric high performance wafer style triple offset high performance butterfly valves.  The seating/unseating torques for the Tricentric valves is 35,000 inch pounds.  One (1) -  Actuator for a Class 300, 24-inch Alfa Laval (Lug type) valves with metal seats, Model Number MYPH11400.  No torque values or other paperwork are available on the existing valve.  Based on the information, available for the Tricentric valves, the seating/unseating torques would have to be a minimum 79,000 inch pounds.  One (1) - Actuator for a Class 300, 24-inch Tricentric high performance wafer style triple offset high performance butterfly valve.  The seating/unseating torque for the Tricentric valve is 79,000 inch pounds.  Two (2) - Actuators for class 300, 12-inch Tricentric high performance wafer style triple offset high performance butterfly valves.  The seating/unseating torques for the Tricentric valves is 22,000 inch pounds.  Flow rates through the valves will be approximately:  18-inch, 15.2 cubic feet per second (6800 gallons per minute); 24-inch, 45 cubic feet per second (20,000 gallons per minute).  The valves will not be used to modulate flow, and will be opened 100 percent during plant operation and left open. An estimated 25 percent duty cycle would be sufficient for the actuator motors.  The valves will be installed with flow arrow pointing towards the discharge of clearwell pumps in order to prevent flow from the pressurized header leaking back through a de energized pump.  The actuators do not accept a 4-20mA analog signal nor does it output a 4-20mA analog signal.  The actuators will only require a discrete pulsing (by remote N.O. contacts) of the motor to the desired position. The fully open and fully close position limits shall be sent for position indication.  Actuator shall also have mechanical position indicator.  All other terms and conditions remain the same. The deadline for receipt of quotes is extended to Monday, April 28, 2003, 4:15 p.m. local time.  Responses to this RFQ should be mailed to Bureau of Reclamation, Yuma Area Office, Attention: YAO-3110, 7301 Calle Agua Salada, Yuma AZ 85364.

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled "To Create a Blue Ribbon Panel For Educator Astronaut Positions", Solicitation Number 4200008022JDP, which was posted on 04/01/03.  The purpose of this modification is two-fold:  1) to delete in its entirety Modification 01 issued to this synopsis; and 2) to provide answers to questions that have been received.	A formal Request for Quotation will be released today. Questions and Answers are as follows: Q: Could you tell me if the solicitation will be looking for a company to find and set up a blue ribbon panel, or are you simply looking for individual panel members?	A: The solicitation NASA will issue seeks a contractor to form the "Blue Ribbon Panel." The contractor selected will be responsible for setting up the panel and delivering the product of the panel to NASA.	Q: Would a not-for-profit organization be eligible to compete for this (once the solicitation is released)?  A: This effort is set-aside for small business participation only.  A not-for-profit would only qualify for this effort if the not-for-profit meets the definition of a small business concern as defined in FAR 19.001 and qualifies as a small business under the NAICS Code and size standard of 611710 and $6.0M, respectively. Q: I need some direction on what to do next.  A: The solicitation NASA will issue seeks a contractor to form the "Blue Ribbon Panel." The contractor selected will be responsible for setting up the panel and delivering the product to NASA. The expected product of the Blue Ribbon Panel is criteria with which to evaluate job applicants for the Educator Astronaut positions to distinguish which are "superior" applicants. These criteria will be used by another panel of subject matter experts in their evaluation of the applicants. If you are interested in submitting a proposal, please refer to the instructions contained in the Request for Quote. Q: Are you looking for one organization to accomplish your goal?  A: NASA seeks a contractor to take on the responsibility of forming the "Blue Ribbon Panel." The panel that is formed by the contractor should be comprised of a diverse group of professionals reflective of the education community, who will develop criteria which NASA will use to evaluate job applicants for Educator Astronaut positions to distinguish which are "superior" educators.  Q: Must the people on the panel be an educator?  A: The "Blue Ribbon Panel" should be comprised of a diverse group of professionals reflective of the education community. It may include, but is not limited to representatives from both the teaching profession and professional education associations.  Q: Regarding the RFQ for the Blue Ribbon Panel for Educator Astronaut Positions, what is the status of an HBCU in this small business set aside?  A: An HBCU does not qualify under a small business set-aside since it is an educational institution.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Request for Information (RFI) synopsis.  Information obtained as a result of this synopsis is for planning purposes only.  It does not constitute an invitation for bid (IFB) or request for proposal (RFP), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the United States Air Force (USAF).  No contract may arise by responding to this RFI.  Also, a response to this RFI does not require the Air Force to further respond. The Air Force will not provide you its views or opinions about your products or services.  No proprietary information should be provided under this RFI, since, once provided, it may be used by the government in the normal course of its business, including disclosure to the public.
The United States Air Force Communications Agency (AFCA/ITXP) is researching varieties of Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP) architectures, and is interested in receiving commercial White Papers and other like documents detailing their cost, availability, capabilities, and benefits to assist in this research. It should be noted that the need for cost data to assist in the planning process, if even only rough order of magnitude data, is the primary driver behind this RFI.
 	Specifically, we would like to see representative data for Router-based, Server-based, and Switch-based VoIP systems, to include estimates of cost and time frames for systems (hardware/software) acquisition, installation, training, and sustainment (2-3 years); specific methods of maintaining high quality of service/quality of signal; and provisions for compatibility with Defense Switch Network (DSN) requirements and interface with the latest commercial TCP/IP developments/upgrades.  
Further, as signal security is an area of major concern relative to VoIP systems, responses should include a brief statement/appraisal of the status of VoIP systems in regard to compliance with Air Force Instruction (AFI) 33-202, Computer Security; CJCSI 6215.01B (Policy for DoD Voice Networks, DSN Certification); and DoD Instruction 5200.40 "DoD Information Technology Security Certification and Accreditation Process" (DITSCAP), December 30, 1997.

Operational density/mission parameters are 700,000 users at 108 fixed bases worldwide, with provision for remote deployment of up to 20% of users. 

NOTE:  THIS SOURCES SOUGHT RFI (REQUEST FOR INFORMATION) IS BEING ISSUED FOR AFCA/ITXP.  QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS RFI AND SUBMITTALS IN RESPONSE TO THIS RFI SHOULD BE SENT TO THE ATTENTION OF EITHER ED DASHMAN, 618-229-6810/6713, edward.dashman@scott.af.mil; ROLAND DUBOSE, 618-229-6810/6472, roland.dubose@scott.af.mil; or STEVEN STONER, 618-229-6810/6709, steven.stoner@scott.af.mil.

Answer: An example of Business Scene can be sent via electronic mail by contacting bsesky@ibb.gov.  Question 5.  What are the expected dimensions of Business Scene?

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis for written information from all parties, especially small and small disadvantaged firms, interested in the upcoming acquisition for operation and maintenance services for the Alaska Radar System.  The information is requested for market research and is not a solicitation announcement for proposals.  No contract will be awarded from this announcement.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests.  There is no solicitation available at this time.  Responses should focus on your firm's technical and financial capability to provide technical and management services for the operation and maintenance of the radar sites in the Alaska Radar System, as described below.  You should address the contracting officer's interest items on (i) North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), (ii) Statement of Objectves (SOO) v. Statement of Work (SOW), and (iii) commercial practices; standard publicity brochures are not particularly desired.  Responses to this synopsis will be used for market research to determine under what, if any, set aside procedures this acquisition will be conducted.  The contractor shall be responsible for all operation and maintenance of the manned and unmanned AN/FPS-117 long-range radars and the AN/FPS/124 unattended short range radars, as well as the site facilities (real property, real property installed equipment, and utility systems) at approximately 18 remote Alaska locations on Alaska's northern and western coasts and mountain interior (access by air, seasonal access by barge).  The contractor will also be responsible for the Maintenance Control and Communications Center and for certain equipment in the Regional Air Operations Center at Elmendorf AFB, Alaska.  Radar operations and maintenance, and other communications-electronics systems, is the core of the requirement, but facilities support is also critical to mission success.  The contractor is responsible for maintenance and snow removal for seven gravel airstrips, many miles of gravel roads, tram systems at several sites, utilities, water and sewage systems, power generation, and environmental protection.  Transportation, logistics, food service and housekeeping, and weather operations are also important elements of operation.  The Government will probably issue the solicitation in the summer of 2003, with award in the January-March 2004 time frame and with performance to begin on 1 October 2004.  The current and previous contracts were solicited on an unrestricted basis, but the Government solicits capability statements and expressions of interest and intent from small businesses.  Given the great complexity of the mission and the broad expertise required in addition to particular expertise on radars, please include information as to the size of your business and any planned teaming arrangement.  Small businesses (including veteran-owned, service-disabled veteran-owned,  HUBZone, disadvantaged, and women-owned, and other small businesses) are particularly invited to respond to express interest in submitting a proposal and to provide information as to their qualifications.  The current contract was acquired with SIC 8744, Facilities Support Management Services.  The corresponding NAICS is 561210, Facilities Support Services.  The corresponding size standard is $23M.  The contracting officer invites input as to whether 513390 for radar station operations is not a more appropriate NAICS.  The current contract's Performance Work Statement (PWS) is attached for industry comments.  The contracting officer invites comment from industry as to whether using a SOO SOO would encourage or discourage firms, especially small businesses, from submitting an offer.  Under the SOO approach, the Government would issue a SOO as part of it solicitation. The SOO would broadly describe the top-level requirements allowing indus

<DESC>THIS SOLICITATION IS HEREBY BEING ISSUED ON AN UNRESTRICTED BASIS INVITING FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.  This procurement will result in the award of up to four (4) separate Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) design-build Construction Contracts general building type projects (new construction and renovations) including but not limited to administrative, aircraft support facilities, medium industrial buildings, marine construction, mechanical and electrical improvements, civil construction (grading, drainage, and sewage, potable water – storage and transmission, training, dormitory, family housing renovation, and community support type facilities for activities in Pensacola, Milton, and Panama City Regional Areas of the State of Florida managed by Southern Division Naval Facilities Engineering Command.  The work will be at the following primary locations:  Naval Air Station Pensacola and outlying airfields; Corry Station; Naval Surface Warfare Center Coastal Systems Station Panama City; Naval Air Station Whiting Field, and outlying airfields in the Panhandle of North West Florida.    Proposers will be evaluated using the Two-Phase Design-Build, Request for Proposal (RFP) procedures that result in awards based on Best Value to the Government, cost or price or other factors considered.  Each contract is for one year with four option years.  The anticipated workload is $75-$100 million over the life of all contracts and the maximum combined value of all contracts will not exceed $200 million. Projects will vary in size from around $3 million to $15 million with the average project in the $3 - $6 million range. The successful offerors will be encouraged to submit technical and price proposals on all future task orders. Lack of participation may result in the Government not exercising the option for extending the contract.  Participation in Pre-Proposal Conferences or Site Visits for the initial award or any task orders would be responsibility of the offeror and is not directly reimbursable by the Government.  Task orders would require multi-disciplined design services in all aspects of general building construction for new and renovation projects including comprehensive interior design, lead and asbestos abatement.  Projects would also require incorporation of sustainable features.  Multiple design teams may be proposed to satisfy a variety of building types projected to be awarded during the term of the contract.  All professional disciplines shall be registered and/or certified in their discipline.  In those states requiring specialized knowledge of local permitting or regulatory agency requirements, the professional discipline shall be registered or certified in that state.  Phase I of the procurement process is a narrowing phase of 3 to 7 proposers (design-build teams) based on design-build factors that include:  Past Performance, Technical Qualifications (including proposed subcontractors), Management Approach and Small Business subcontracting effort.  Phase I design-build factors relate to the five (5) year IDIQ contract requirements for general building type projects including (new construction and renovation) but not limited to administrative, aircraft support facility, medium industrial buildings, marine construction, mechanical, electrical improvements civil construction grading, drainage, sewage, potable water-storage, transmission, training, dormitory, family housing renovation and community support type facilities.  Only those proposers selected in Phase I will be allowed to proceed into Phase II.  In Phase II, the successful 3 to 7 Phase I offerors must submit technical and price proposals.  Offerors who fail to submit technical and price proposals would not be considered for an award.  The Phase II technical proposal will require preparation of a limited design solution; Small Business Subcontracting Effort; and other factors that define the quality of construction.  Cost and Price proposal may include total cost or evaluation of scope/design options with the Government’s published budget for award.  The offeror with the best value proposal, for each see project, if there is more than one, will be awarded the seed project under one of the IDIQ design-build contracts.  An offeror may be awarded more than one of the see projects if it is in the Government's best interest. The other IDIQ contract(s) will be awarded to the design-build offeror(s) who provide the best overall proposal(s) for all seed projects after those offerors who have been awarded a seed project(s) have been removed from further competition.   A minimum guarantee of $50,000 will be consideration for the award of the other IDIQ contract(s) where a seed project is not awarded.  The minimum guarantee will be payable only if the offeror(s) are awarded no task orders over the five (5) year contract term.  Future task orders would be competed among the firms that were awarded an IDIQ contract, with each task order awarded based on best value or lowest price technically acceptable proposal.  The seed project(s) for this solicitation are unconfirmed at this time.  Due to funding constraints, authorization to advertise see project(s) is not expected until after the Phase I portion of this solicitation is completed.  It is possible that no seed project(s) will be authorized during this fiscal year and Phase II competition would be postponed until at least one suitable seed project is identified.

Background	                           

Recent events have reinforced the importance of FDA’s long-standing interest in the development of improved methods for the identification of potential threat agents in foods.  CFSAN maintains an active research program for developing and enhancing methodologies to detect and identify microbial hazards that may contaminate food and food products either naturally or through deliberate contamination.  Standard protocols for isolation of the most commonly occurring pathogens have been developed.  Traditionally, these protocols rely on enrichment and selective culture media for the isolation of a pathogen from the food.  CFSAN needs to further enhance its detection and identification capabilities with respect to pathogens that are not typically considered to be foodborne pathogens.  Specifically, there is a need to develop bacterial growth media that will improve the recovery of these atypical pathogens from priority food matrices.  Initial efforts will focus specifically in the detection of Brucella and Burkholderia species associated with human disease. 

Statement of Work

The contract shall include preliminary assessment of growth and isolation characteristics of pure culture isolates in media from commercial or other sources.  Furthermore, selected media preparations which have been found to hold the greatest promise for fulfillment of the goals will be evaluated for use with representative food matrix categories of interest.  Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the contractor shall furnish the necessary personnel, materials, services, facilities, and otherwise do all things necessary for or incident to the performance of the work. 

The contractor shall work closely with CFSAN throughout this requirement.  All services shall be provided in a timely manner to help ensure that CFSAN can fulfill its regulatory responsibilities and guard the American public from intentional or accidental contamination of the food supply with these microbiological agents.

Task 1

Initially the contractor shall identify those liquid and solid, enrichment and selective media that are available for culture of Brucella abortus, melitensis, and suis (Brucella spp.).  These media formulations may be drawn from a number of sources, including, but not limited to commercially available media and the scientific literature. 

The contractor shall evaluate each solid selective and liquid culture medium formulation for its possible application in culturing Brucella spp. from foods that are representative of several food groups of interest to CFSAN.  CFSAN will work with the contractor to identify specific food matrices to be used.  It is intended that a few foods will be chosen as representatives of five general food categories or groups that may be defined either by dietary function, composition or storage conditions.  For example, milk (high fat), powdered infant formula (dry product, consumption on relevant subpopulation), lettuce (leafy vegetable), shrimp salad (high fat, complex matrix), raspberries (fruit).

Upon completion, the contractor shall consult with CFSAN regarding which media hold the greatest potential for use in enrichment and selective culture of Brucella spp.

Those enrichment or selective culture media that demonstrate the greatest potential for use with different food matrices will be modified as needed to produce reliable media for enrichment and selective culture of Brucella spp. species from food.

Task 2

Initially the contractor shall identify those liquid and solid, enrichment and selective media that are available for culture of Burkholderia mallei and pseudomallei (Burkholderia spp).   These media formulations may be drawn from a number of sources, including, but not limited to commercially available media and the scientific literature. 

The contractor shall evaluate each solid selective and liquid culture medium formulation for its possible application in culturing Burkholderia spp. from foods that are representative of several food groups of interest to CFSAN.  CFSAN will work with the contractor to identify specific food matrices to be used.  It is intended that a few foods will be chosen as representatives of five general food categories or groups that may be defined either by dietary function, composition or storage conditions.  For example, milk (high fat), powdered infant formula (dry product, consumption on relevant subpopulation), lettuce (leafy vegetable), shrimp salad (high fat, complex matrix), raspberries (fruit).

Upon completion, the contractor shall consult with CFSAN regarding which media hold the greatest potential for use in enrichment and selective culture of Burkholderia spp.

Those enrichment or selective culture media that demonstrate the greatest potential for use with different food matrices will be modified as needed to produce reliable media for enrichment and selective culture of Burkholderia spp. from food.

Security Issues

All personnel involved in the performance of this task order shall have a secret or higher security clearance.  The clearance shall be obtained prior to commencement of any work.  Performance of this task order shall be conducted in accordance with the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM).  The manual can be accessed at the following web site:   <http://www.dss.mil/isec/nispom.htm>.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT  The U.S. Coast Guard is conducting market research to determine the existence and interest of possible sources to provide and install Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Automatic Data Acquisition System (ADAS) to upgrade an existing LTS101-750B-2 Engine Test Cell located at the US Coast Guard Aircraft Repair and Supply Center, Elizabeth City, NC, that will include labor, materials, software, hardware, engineering and design configurations, modifications, documentation, operating manuals, training and system testing.  The ADAS will perform all required data acquisition and performance calculations defined in the LTS101-750B-2 Original Engineering Manufacture Testing Instruction (OEM-TI) 8124 revision B.  The basic system will consist of necessary hardware and software to acquire raw analog engine data, perform signal conditioning and time averaging, perform specific engine performance calculations, and output the data results to a video display, printer, and magnetic media.  It shall also have capability to perform diagnostics/troubleshooting on the engine under test and determine engine stability to enable the system to automatically record data at engine stabilization.  The ADAS will display all pertinent parameters for the engine under test, their target values, and operator instructions in accordance with the OEM-TI 8124.  This system shall be self-calibrating.  The ADAS system and all related upgrades must be compatible with the T700 Engine Test Cell and also adaptable to all future upgrades.  The T700 Engine Test cell has a CMR-ADAS that is an operator prompted and controlled computer based data acquisition system that monitors, conditions, processes, calculates, records and displays in graphic/animated formats various channels of engine/dynamometer generated electrical signals that represent specific engine/dynamometer operating parameters.  The CMR-ADAS performs the same functions on electrical signals generated by thermocouples and a barometric pressure transducer that when processed by the CMR-ADAS, equate to the ambient conditions (temperature and barometric pressure) in the engine run room.  The resulting ambient condition valves are also used by the CMR-ADAS to calculate certain engine performance factors such as the Shaft Horse Power output of the engine under test.  It shall be contractor's responsibility to acquire any and all specification data concerning the Original Engineering Manufacture Testing Instruction (OEM-TI) 8124 revision B prior to award.  Interested companies are encouraged to respond to this announcement as soon as possible.

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis for written information from all parties, especially small and small disadvantaged firms, interested in the upcoming acquisition for operation and maintenance services for the Alaska Radar System.  The information is requested for market research and is not a solicitation announcement for proposals.  No contract will be awarded from this announcement.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests.  There is no solicitation available at this time.  Responses should focus on your firm's technical and financial capability to provide technical and management services for the operation and maintenance of the radar sites in the Alaska Radar System, as described below.  You should address the contracting officer's interest items on (i) North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), (ii) Statement of Objectves (SOO) v. Statement of Work (SOW), and (iii) commercial practices; standard publicity brochures are not particularly desired.  Responses to this synopsis will be used for market research to determine under what, if any, set aside procedures this acquisition will be conducted.  The contractor shall be responsible for all operation and maintenance of the manned and unmanned AN/FPS-117 long-range radars and the AN/FPS/124 unattended short range radars, as well as the site facilities (real property, real property installed equipment, and utility systems) at approximately 18 remote Alaska locations on Alaska's northern and western coasts and mountain interior (access by air, seasonal access by barge).  The contractor will also be responsible for the Maintenance Control and Communications Center and for certain equipment in the Regional Air Operations Center at Elmendorf AFB, Alaska.  Radar operations and maintenance, and other communications-electronics systems, is the core of the requirement, but facilities support is also critical to mission success.  The contractor is responsible for maintenance and snow removal for seven gravel airstrips, many miles of gravel roads, tram systems at several sites, utilities, water and sewage systems, power generation, and environmental protection.  Transportation, logistics, food service and housekeeping, and weather operations are also important elements of operation.  The Government will probably issue the solicitation in the summer of 2003, with award in the January-March 2004 time frame and with performance to begin on 1 October 2004.  The current and previous contracts were solicited on an unrestricted basis, but the Government solicits capability statements and expressions of interest and intent from small businesses.  Given the great complexity of the mission and the broad expertise required in addition to particular expertise on radars, please include information as to the size of your business and any planned teaming arrangement.  Small businesses (including veteran-owned, service-disabled veteran-owned,  HUBZone, disadvantaged, and women-owned, and other small businesses) are particularly invited to respond to express interest in submitting a proposal and to provide information as to their qualifications.  The current contract was acquired with SIC 8744, Facilities Support Management Services.  The corresponding NAICS is 561210, Facilities Support Services.  The corresponding size standard is $23M.  The contracting officer invites input as to whether 513390 for radar station operations is not a more appropriate NAICS.  The current contract's Performance Work Statement (PWS) is attached for industry comments.  The contracting officer invites comment from industry as to whether using a SOO SOO would encourage or discourage firms, especially small businesses, from submitting an offer.  Under the SOO approach, the Government would issue a SOO as part of it solicitation. The SOO would broadly describe the top-level requirements allowing industry maximum flexibility to propose innovative and cost effective methods to meet those objectives.  The previous acquisition for this requirement was not accomplished under FAR Part 12 because of the complexity and type of contract terms and conditions.  However, responses to this synopsis will be used to assist the contracting officer to determine whether the upcoming acquisition can be accomplished under Part 12.  Interested firms should submit information on their experience, capabilities, and resources to satisfactorily perform the mission as stated in the PWS.  Capability statements of up to 15 pages in length may be submitted to the contracting officer, Timothy Inman, 3CONS/LGCZ, 10480 22nd Street, Elmendorf AFB, AK  99506, and are requested by 8 October 2002.

<SUBJECT>42--Radiation Biodosimetry Assessment Tool (BAT) Decision Support Software for Emergency Response.
<SOLNBR>TSWG-0003
<RESPDATE>062303
<ARCHDATE>08222003
<CONTACT>Renee Hodge, 410-278-0881
<DESC>NA The Technical Support Working Group (TSWG) invites interest from developers and producers of decision support systems capable of using or incorporating the Radiation Biodosimetry Assessment Tool (BAT) program, public domain data and software developed by t he Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute (AFRRI), in limited support (no funding) for commercial development of systems for use by military, federal, state, and local first responders to incidents involving weapons of mass destruction, and all manne r of disasters, whether natural or man-made,involving a radiation threat.  The BAT program provides diagnostic information (clinical signs and symptoms, physical dosimetry, etc.) relevant to the management of human radiation casualties.  Designed primarily for prompt use after a radiation incident, the program facilitates the col lection, integration, and archiving of data obtained from exposed persons.  Data collected in templates is compared with established radiation dose responses, obtained from the literature, to provide multi-parameter dose assessments.  The program archives clinical information (extent of radioactive contamination, wounds, infection, etc.) useful for casualty management, displays relevant diagnostic information in a concise format, and can be used to manage both military and civilian radiation accidents.  An integrated, interactive human body map permits convenient documentation of the location of a personnel dosimeter, radiation-induced erythema, and radioactivity detected by an appropriate radiation detection device.  In addition, the program archives collec ted information for later use in radiation protection matters.  The executable code and supporting graphics files fit on a single CD-ROM and require standard 32-bit Windows operating systems.  TSWG is funding the conversion of the BAT program to be compatible with a number of handheld systems - Windows OS, Palm OS, and MS Windows CE (or Windows for Pocket PC) - to make the BAT program more accessible and operationally suitable to emergency respo nse units. Converted software will be available incrementally over the next 12 months depending on application and operating system.   Developers or producers of decision support systems or software incorporating the BAT program may, at their option and subject to availability of resources at AFFRI,  enter into No Cost Demonstration Agreements with AFFRI to facilitate review and beta test ing of their systems for military and other applications as well as the development of improved versions of the BAT program for follow-on release. Expressions of interest are requested within 60 days so that accommodations can be made for specific software adaptations and arrangements can be made for fast track demonstration, review, and testing. The Technical Support Working Group (TSWG) is the U.S. Government's national forum that identifies, prioritizes, and coordinates interagency and international research and development (R&D) requirements for combating terrorism.  For information on TSWG tec hnology projects, transition opportunities, and other user information, please visit the TSWG web page at www.tswg.gov. PROCUREMENT: This is not a solicitation for procurement, nor does it imply one will be forthcoming from the U.S. Government.  Any company interested in utilizing the BAT program may respond to this Notice of Data Availability by sending e-mail to the follo wing address: TechTrans@TSWG.gov. The e-mail should contain contact person’s name, address, telephone number, and information on the decision support system for which they are requesting use of the software.

<SUBJECT>R -- Notice of Intent to Modify an Existing Contract
<DESC>This is a notice of intent to negotiate a non-competitive contract modification with The Futures Group International, 1050 17th Street, NW, Suite 1000, Washington, DC 20036 under existing contract number HRN-C-00-00-00006-00 (Policy II Project).  This modification will extend the estimated completion date by nine months, from July 7, 2005 through March 6, 2006 and increase the total estimated cost by $55,000,000. This modification will provide a bridging mechanism for the continued provision of highly specialized technical assistance in health issues such as reproductive health, safe motherhood, and HIV/AIDS until a new contract is competed and awarded. The types of activities to be supported during this extension period include the following: 1) provide assistance to expand the participation of non-governmental organizations in the policy process; 2) help policymakers design policies and financial mechanisms to increase the level of available resources and promote use of those resources for reproductive health services; 3) provide information to support policy decision-making by conducting or commissioning country-specific research to answer policy questions; and 4) train and support locally-hired, long-term advisors to promote the policy process in-country. USAID intends to negotiate this modification with only one source under the authority of AIDAR 706.302-70, where an award is for the continued provision of highly specialized services and award to another source would result in substantial additional cost to the Government or would result in unacceptable project delays.  This notice is not a request for proposals and no solicitation is available. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement by submitting capability statement (limit two pages).  The firm’s experience must include familiarity with health issues such as reproductive health, safe motherhood, and HIV/AIDS.  The firm must have a cadre of highly qualified professionals, including local in-country staff with policy expertise, who have experience working with host-country governments, civil society organizations, and USAID Missions. All expressions of interest must be received within ten (10) days after issuance of this notice. Any information received will be considered for the purpose of conducting a competitive procurement.

<DESC>MapInfo Software: The United States General Accounting Office (GAO) intends to issue an order under other than full and open competition to MapInfo Corporation, 3 Bethesda Metro Center, Suite M025, Bethesda, MD 20814.  The purpose of this acquisition is to convert GAO’s existing installed base of standalone MapInfo software licenses to a limited concurrent license able to be managed through GAO’s Novell-based network.  The total number of limited concurrent use licenses to be acquired is to be 25.  As well, GAO will acquire Upgrade Protection for a period of 1 year.  This limited concurrent use license is a custom license to be provided by MapInfo Corporation to allow GAO to satisfy its pattern of intermittent project driven use without having to acquire a large number of individual licenses, or the unlimited concurrent use license, both options being cost prohibitive.  MapInfo is the sole provider of this custom license and it is not available from MapInfo partners or VARs.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only once source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, the Government will consider all proposals received within thirty days after date of publication of this synopsis.

<SUBJECT>38 -- Mirror Lake Picnic Ground Pre-Solicitation Site Visit
<DESC>The one-time pre-solicitation project site tour will be conducted on September 26, 2002, 11:00 am local time. The pre-solicitation meeting will be conducted at the Brush Creek/Hayden Ranger District Office, South Highway 130, Saratoga, Wyoming. 

Description: This project consists of furnishing all labor, supervision, materials other than Government furnished, and transportation necessary to reconstruct and pave the Mirror Lake Picnic Ground Roads (NFSR 228), parking areas and trails along with recreation fixture construction (picnic tables, benches, grates, harden surfaces, etc.). Work to be performed shall include construction staking, clearing & grubbing, excavation, borrow excavation, topsoil stripping, crushed aggregate, hot bituminous pavement, chip sealing, culvert installation, recreation fixtures, seeding, signing, and pavement striping. The project site is located adjacent to Wyoming State Highway Number 130, approximately 45 miles west of Laramie Wyoming, in Albany County, on the Brush Creek/Hayden Ranger District, Medicine Bow-Routt National Forest. The legal description is in T16N, R79W, Sec 19 (NFSR 228). 

It is anticipated that a solicitation for this project will be issued and awarded this winter; work is tentatively scheduled to begin July 7, 2003. Contract duration will be 75 days. The estimated dollar range for the project is $250,000 to $500,000. Note: another Notice will be posted prior to issuance of the actual solicitation. Because access to the project site in the spring is difficult at best, the site visit is being held this fall. All potential offerors are invited to attend. If you plan to attend the pre-solicitation site visit, please contact Scott Brown at 970/498-1151, by September 23, 2002. If there are no calls indicating attendance, the meeting will be cancelled.

<SUBJECT>A -- Cooperative Research and Development Agreement to Further Develop DNA Melting Analysis for Detection of Single Nucleotide Polymorphism
<DESC>The Laboratory of Neurogenetics (LNG), National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) at the National Institutes of Health seeks a CRADA Collaborator. The principal goal of this CRADA is to increase the efficiency and sensitivity of identifying gene variants, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Because SNPs are present in large numbers in human populations (estimated at several million over the entire genome), they are likely to be retained because they are either genetically neutral or they confer survival advantages. However, when combined with other polymorphisms or environmental factors, SNPs may become low-level disease risk factors or disease modifiers. An understanding of functional variations among groups of people is important to medicine for many reasons, including the design of more effective therapeutic drugs and a better understanding of drug side effects, a concept known as pharmacogenetics. DNA melting analysis developed by LNG uses melting of DNA duplexes in solution to detect sequence variants.

Potential Areas of Application:

-rapid discovery of gene sequence variants 
-individualized drug therapeutics 

Main Advantages of Technology/Invention:

-non-gel-based fluorescence, high throughput method 
-ability to detect previously undiscovered sequence variants 
-knowledge of the SNP (or other variant, such as an insertion or deletion) sequence is not required 
-expensive oligonucleotide hybridization probes is not required 
-modification of the primary sequence (i.e. introduction of a "GC clamp") to a PCR-generated amplicon to detect differences in melting behavior is not required 
-method is easily automated using available equipment 
-simultaneous analysis of a large number of samples 
-necessary reagents may be combined in a single step 
-melting analysis may be repeated multiple times on a single sample to reduce statistical data variation 

State of Development:

-DNA melting analysis readily detects differences in the melting temperature between mixtures of DNAs having single base mismatches, deletions, or insertions and a perfectly based paired primary sequence 
-PCR-generated amplicons of 15-167 base pairs in length have been shown to be amenable to this technology/invention. Even larger longer DNAs can be potentially used to discover sequence variants 
-DNA amplicon concentrations are highly reproducible, with a coefficient of variation of 2.6% 

Further R&D Required:

Under the present proposal, the overall goal of the CRADA collaboration will involve the following:

1.Further improvement of the technology/invention for high throughput applications including improved efficiency and sensitivity. 
2.Developing improved melting parameters for larger PCR-generated DNAs for DNA melting analysis. 
3.Developing software to improve variant detection by DNA melting analysis.

<DESC>I.  	BACKGROUND - 

The U.S. Department of Education, Office of Federal Student Aid (FSA) is seeking a contractor to perform system enhancements and maintenance work to an automated appeal processing system.  Search & Appeal Professional (S&A Pro) is Default Management's IT system for tracking all documentation submitted by schools for its cohort default rate (CDR) adjustments and/or appeals in a given year.  It is also used to capture and maintain the adjustment and appeal data and it provides basic logic to assist the caseworker with the decision making process during their review and analysis.  The system, an MS access database with a visual basic front end, was developed over a 4-year period, between 1995 and 1999.  Revisions and/or upgrades to S&A Pro have been made in FY 2000 and 2001 in response to system instability, FSA software upgrade to MS office suite, and to the CDR regulatory changes impacting system logic.  

Further system enhancements and maintenance work are required to ensure Default Management staff continues to work efficiently and effectively in a stable and reliable environment.  Below are several system requirements that need to be addressed this year to resolve system deficiencies and to enhance functionality.  These system requirements must be resolved and the system fully operational no later than mid-September, 2003. 

II.	REQUIREMENTS - 

S&A Pro currently consists of four sub-systems - mail tracking, loan servicing, erroneous data/new data adjustment, and uncorrected data adjustment.  The mail tracking subsystem tracks the submission of all appeal/adjustment documentation and appeal/adjustment determinations.  The loan servicing, erroneous data/new data adjustment, and uncorrected data adjustment subsystems are used to record and review the appeals/adjustments that are submitted to Default Management.

A.	Development Environment Requirements - 

1)	System must be developed and tested by the contractor within the Department's network environment.
2)	Appropriate source code must be identified and used by the contractor in the development and/or modification of the system.
3)	Appropriate version control tools and procedures must be used.

B.	S&A Pro Modification Requirements - 

1)	The latest version of S&A Pro, developed by a contractor, was tested by Default Management prior to acceptance.  However, due to the unavailability of the FY 2000 loan record detail report (LRDR) at the time of the testing, neither Default Management nor the contractor was aware of problems related to the year "2000" until the system was in use for the FY 2000 appeal season.  The contractor for this project must resolve all problems resulting from the FY 2000 LRDR, including, but not limited to, the following:

a)	FY 2000 tallies not working;
b)	All screens showing FY 2000 as "100";
c)	Problems with LRDR showing loans inappropriately when D5 and D6 loans are included.

2)	At the time S&A Pro was originally developed, the five following appeal/adjustment types were included in the system: erroneous data, loan servicing, mitigating circumstances, Pell exception requests, request for adjustment.  Some of these appeal/adjustment types are no longer in use, and others have changed names.    

The appeal/adjustment types that need to be updated to reflect current regulations are: erroneous data/new data adjustment (in place of erroneous data), loan servicing appeal (in place of loan servicing), economically disadvantaged and completion rate appeal and economically disadvantaged and placement rate appeal (in place of mitigating circumstances), participation rate index appeal (in place of Pell exception requests), and uncorrected data adjustment (in place of request for adjustment).  These names should be updated in S&A Pro and in the Appeal Browser (adding the participation rate index and the two economically disadvantaged appeal types to the Appeal Browser, for a total of six adjustment/appeal types).  
	
3)	Currently, S&A Pro does not contain logic related to a school's eligibility to submit an appeal for a prior year.  In general, a school is not eligible to submit a prior-year loan servicing appeal if the school is not subject to certain sanctions.  A school may only submit a loan servicing appeal based on its most recent cohort default rate, unless the school is subject to loss of eligibility to participate in the loan programs due to high cohort default rates.  This logic needs to be incorporated into S&A Pro to reduce the risk of error by a caseworker. 

C.	System Generated Error Log Requirement - 

Currently, when an error occurs in S&A Pro, the caseworker must capture the situation verbatim, so that it can be replicated and the underlying problem identified and resolved.  This requires the caseworker to create a screen-shot of the error and write up a detailed explanation of exactly what was in the operating field when the error occurred.  Recall of the exact steps is very difficult and time consuming, and an inaccurate recollection will result in an inability to replicate the error.  The caseworker has to delete the case from the file and recreate it.  This does not correct the underlying system problem and generally the error will reoccur. 

Depending on the type of error, the caseworker may not be able to continue to work on the case, or any other case, until the error is fixed.  Downtime can be a few hours to several days and may affect one or all caseworkers. 

The creation of an error log could greatly alleviate the time needed to correct errors.  At the time an error occurs, a "system generated error log" would be created.  The log would accurately record the error and the situation associated with the error.  Thus, quicker error resolution, resulting in less "downtime" and more efficient and accurate work effort.

D.	S&A Pro File Organization and Documentation Requirements

1)	During S&A Pro's development, there were many versions of the system placed on Default Management's shared drive (Q drive).  The various versions were not adequately labeled, making it difficult to determine what is essential and what is obsolete.  There are old versions of set-up programs and old documentation. 

The material currently residing on the Q drive must be reviewed, and irrelevant, outdated material deleted.  The  documentation on the Q drive needs to be organized into an easily usable format, using folders that are properly labeled so that Default Management staff and other IT contract staff can easily identify and access the information.  This will help to ensure that old, outdated files are not used during future S&A Pro development. 

2)	The user manuals for the S&A Pro modules were developed in October, 1999.  They have not been updated since that date.  However, there have been enhancements, revisions and upgrades made to the S&A Pro module that are not reflected in the current manuals, entity relationship diagrams and field descriptions.    

In order to ensure that  Default Management has the appropriate system documentation to be able to fully utilize S&A Pro, to train new users and to enable IT staff to efficiently work on the system, the manuals, entity diagrams and data field descriptions need to be updated.  All system enhancements and features added in FY 2001 and FY 2002 must be documented to limit Default Management's exposure, including the ability to view previous year’s appeals in S&A Pro and the Appeal Browser.  

E.	PEPS Update Requirement - 

The Postsecondary Education Participants System (PEPS) is the Federal Student Aid (FSA) management information system of all organizations that have a role in administering Student Financial Aid and other Higher Education Act programs.  PEPS maintains eligibility, certification, demographic, financial, review, audit and default rate data about schools, lenders and guarantors participating in the Title IV programs. 

Currently, information from S&A Pro regarding revised cohort default rates and appeal/adjustment information is manually updated in PEPS.  This is done on a weekly basis during the appeal season, which generally runs from October through February.  This is necessary to ensure that ED staff outside of Default Management (Case Teams, etc.) has access to the most current and accurate cohort default rate information.  

It would be more efficient if this process could be done electronically via a file extract from S&A Pro, which could be downloaded into PEPS on a weekly basis.  Overall, this would be more cost-efficient, as staff time would no longer be needed for this process.  In addition, the risk of data entry error would be eliminated, and the time lag between the update into S&A Pro and the manual update into PEPS would be eliminated.

VI.	CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL SECURITY - 

Contractor personnel placed in key contract positions and those with sensitive access to the database may be required to obtain a Department clearance.  This clearance may involve a background investigation in accordance with the Department's Handbook #11, Personnel Suitability and Security Manual Program Manual.  The Department in accordance with Handbook #11 will determine clearance levels.

Should key persons already have a clearance on file with the contractor, the following information will be needed by the Department to make a clearance acceptance determination:

Employee's name
Date and Place of Birth
SSN
Level of Clearance on File
Date Granted
Type of Investigation Done
Agency Conducting the Investigation
Agency Granting the Clearance

This can be provided by memorandum.

Should the Department decide a clearance is needed, the contractor employees will submit the appropriate security clearance paperwork necessary to obtain the correct level of clearance within one week of notification.   The paperwork will be properly filled out and reviewed for completeness prior to submission to the Department.  

Should a clearance be denied, the affected employee will be removed from that position on the contract, or from the contract entirely if the Department finds that person unsuitable.  If required, a security clearance is a dependency for completion of the contract.

VII.	PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE - 

The term of the Contractor's assignment in performing the services outlined above shall be the period from the date of issuance to September 30, 2003, with an option for two additional one-year periods, ending September 30, 2004 and September 30, 2005, respectively.  The additional option years will be for ongoing maintenance/modifications to the system.

VIII.	EVALUATION CRITERIA - 

Quotations will be evaluated on the following technical measures:

1)	Demonstrated familiarity with cohort default rate process, including cohort default rate challenges and appeals.

2)	Demonstrated experience with Microsoft Access databases, relational database design techniques and methodology, and Visual Basic for Applications.

3)	Demonstrated diverse computer programming experience with knowledge of networks and server technology.

4)	Demonstrated experience in the preparation of plain language technical documentation, including user manuals.

The Government is seeking a firm-fixed price for this project, i.e., a single bottom-line price rather than a variable pricing arrangement such as an hourly rate or expenses.  The Government will only pay the firm-fixed price and will not reimburse the contractor for any costs incurred.  Price should be reflected in the quote for the 1st year of the contract as well as broken out for each option year.  In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.217-5, except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206(b) not to be in the Government's best interests, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). 

The technical evaluation is more important than cost, but as technical quotations converge, price becomes more important.  The contracting officer will determine if any difference in technical merit warrants a difference in price.  

Quotations submitted in response to this solicitation notice should be no longer than ten (10) pages in length (Submissions over ten pages will be excluded from further review and evaluation).  Quotations must be received electronically no later than 5:00 p.m. by May 7, 2003 by Deborah Wrabley at deborah.wrabley@ed.gov.	

Questions on this request for quotations should be addressed to Deborah Wrabley at deborah.wrabley@ed.gov.

<DESC>(i)  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  (ii)  Solicitation F0260103Q0144 is being issued as a request for quotation.  (iii)  This solicitation incorporates clauses and provisions in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 01-13.  (iv)  This requirement is being synopsized as a small business set-aside under standard industrial classification code 4959, NAICS code 562910, small business size standard of 500 employees.  (v)  CLIN one is for services listed in vi.  (vi)  Please propose for the following services:  1.  Furnish all management, supervision, labor, tools, transportation, materials, supplies, and equipment necessary to conduct site characterization at former underground storage tank (UST) locations at the Army and Air Force Exchange (AAFES) service station, building 2513.  The site characterization should define the extent of vertical soil contamination in accordance with Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) requirements.  2.  Review documents from a previous site investigation to further define contamination from Leaking Underground Storage Tanks (LUST).  The Contractor will be a certified State of Arizona UST decommissioning technician in accordance with Arizona Administrative Code (AAC) R18-12- 262 through 264.  Perform the site assessments and assemble the lab sample analysis in a report that meets the LUST case closure regulations.  3.  In January 2003, four 10,000 gallon underground storage tanks and associated dispensers were excavated and removed from building 2513. An initial assessment report is available for review.  Results of the initial assessment indicates total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) soil contamination determined using Arizona Department of Environmental Quality methods 8260 and 8310, extending to a depth of at least 14 feet below grade surface (bgs) at the UST locations and two to three feet bgs at pipeline and dispenser locations.  The total vertical and lateral extent of TPH soil contamination was not determined during the initial assessment.  Sampling for lateral extent soil contamination is not required because soil analysis shows contamination well below the Residential Soil Remediation Standards.  4.  The purpose of this project is to delineate the vertical limits of detectable soil contamination. The Contractor shall provide a mobile lab and qualified personnel to screen for petroleum contamination who shall be on site and responsible for all soil boring and sampling activities.  5.  The Contractor shall drill five (5) soil borings.  These borings shall be drilled to a depth of 25 feet below grade (bg) or 10 feet below grade based on the grade of the last field-detected contamination.  Placement of borings should be determined based on information in the initial assessment report and as required by the ADEQ follow-up report.  Borings may have to be extended if field observations detect contamination.  The Contractor will not drill beyond a depth of 25 feet unless given approval by the Government representative.  All borings are to be backfilled with fresh soil by the Contractor.
Bore 1: Lust File# 0128.33 – Former UST #3, bore to 25 feet bgs
Bore 2: Lust File# 0128.34 – Dispenser #1, bore to 10 feet bgs
Bore 3: Lust File# 0128.35 – Dispenser #2, bore to 10 feet bgs
Bore 4: Lust File# 0128.36 – Dispenser #4, bore to 10 feet bgs
Bore 5: Lust File# 0128.37 – Product line/ elbow #8, bore to 10 ft bgs. 
6.  Sample Collection: All samples will be field-screened for the presence of organic vapors.  Samples will be collected in accordance with Arizona Administrative Code for UST Closure.  7.  Sample Analysis: A total of five (5) soil samples will be submitted to an Arizona state-certified laboratory and analyzed for the presence of Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons using ADEQ method 8310 for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and method 8260 for volatile organic compounds (VOC).  If initial borings show field detection, then the borings will extend in 5 foot increments until no detection, for example, 10, 15, 20, and 25 feet bg.  If borings are drilled beyond 25 feet bg, the contracting officer representative will determine which samples are to be analyzed based upon boring logs and field organic vapor readings, and if any additional samples are necessary.  8.  Prepare and submit required reports to Base Environmental Flight, 355 CES/CEV.  The reports shall be submitted in draft form for review, and revisions made as directed by the Government representative.  All reports shall be prepared in accordance with ADEQ Guidance Document "LUST Site Characterization Report Checklist".  9.  Sample and analyze for contamination in accordance with ADEQ case closure procedures.  Sampling will be done to a depth of no detection of contamination.  Upon completion of all site activities, return the site to pre-construction condition.  Submit a Site Closure Report within twenty one (21) calendar days of completing all fieldwork and receipt of all analytical results.  Ensure the report meets the standards set forth in the Arizona Administrative Code (AAC) R18-12-263.03 (D).  10.  Soil cuttings are to be placed in 55-gallon drums (provided by the Contractor) and labeled with the boring numbers and depth intervals.  The Government will dispose of filled drums.  The Contractor will dispose of rinsate off base in accordance with all Federal, State, and/or local regulations.  Following completion of the project, any trash, debris, and excess grout generated by the project is to be removed by the Contractor.  11.  Obtain all necessary Federal, State and/or local environmental permits, licenses and/or certificates required to perform and complete the work.

This plan shall include at a minimum, the Contractor's methods, equipment, and procedures for carrying out all fieldwork including drilling, soil sampling, and decontamination procedures.  13.  All activities shall be conducted in compliance with all Federal, State and local environmental laws, statutes and regulations.  14.

<DESC>SUMMARY OF PURPOSE

The Department of State’s (DoS) MED is seeking to relocate medical records from SA-1 to SA-15.

BACKGROUND

MED operates, administers and manages a worldwide health care program for employees and their families serving abroad with the DoS and all other associated U.S. Federal agencies. To optimally manage and allocate it’s financial and human resources while maintaining quality health care standards; MED recently began to reengineer its key medical record processes and to modernize its technical infrastructure. Together, these initiatives will greatly enhance MED’s ability to provide efficient and effective services, increase MED’s capabilities for developing, maintaining and supporting key medical information and position MED to manage its operations in a changing business environment.

One of the primary aspects of the new business environment in MED will be an Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system. In preparation for implementation of this multi-faceted system, MED is migrating its paper-based medical record to images and reengineering the workflow of the medical records section of MED.

The medical record section is presently located at SA-1, Columbia Plaza and all scanning and medical records maintenance has been performed there. Due to employee growth and workflow requirements, the medial records section will relocate to a larger office located in Rosslyn, Va. Commencing in April 2003. Because of the need to continue necessary operations the timeframe for this relocation is material to this procurement.

MEDICAL RECORD INFRASTRUCTURE

The medical records section of MED contains approximately 56,000 individual paper medical records stored in 16 electronically rotated files (Lektrievers). Files are stored numerically by electronically created individual medical record numbers. A medical record is kept until the employee retires, a dependent child reaches age 21 or there has been no medical clearance activity on the record for a period of six years.

PROPOSAL REQUIREMENTS

The proposal for this work should include:
1. Summary section that demonstrates a basic understanding of the proposal requirements.
2. A technical approach section that outlines activities planned to complete tasks and the timeline required.
3. A brief lists of corporate qualifications, demonstrating experience I relocation. 
4. Resumes of Key Staff proposed to work on this project, including specific skills and experience.
5. A price proposal for the SOW by tasks and deliverables.
6. A quote to buy and install new high density filing units, including height, width, depth and inches including pitch. Quote should include all necessary component parts of the filing units.
7. For this solicitation, technical merit is more important than cost of price.  Numerical calculation or formula relationship between cost for price and technical merit will not automatically determine awards.  As technical merit of the offerors’ proposals becomes more equal, the evaluated cost or price may become the determining factor.  The Contracting Officer shall determine what trade-off between technical merit and cost or price promises the greatest value to the Government, cost or price and other factors considered.

At peak season, as many as 4,000 charts will be routed and delivered in a month’s time. On average, 30 new records are created each day, adding 7,200 new paper records each year. Additionally, approximately 3,585 paper medical documents are received on a monthly basis that requires processing.

Technical  EVALUATION FACTORS
Proposals will be evaluated based on the following technical evaluation factors that are listed in descending of importance.
1. Time Required to order, obtain, and install new, high-density filing units as specified in the SOW 
2. Time required to relocate current lektrievers and related medical files to the SA-15 office space described 
3. Whether proposed units have sufficient headroom to insure that both files and out-guides (markers for files checked out) fit within the vertical filing space.  The amount of filing space (linear filing inches) provided per new filing unit, units must be less than 11 feet in height.

SOW

The tasks for the vendor will include:

1. Provide and install several (exact number to be determined by Department depending on price and size) new high-density units sufficient to increase filing capacity by a minimum of 25 percent. The units must be less than 11 feet in height and fit within the floor space available (approximately 20’ x 5’). The units must include a posting board and allow sufficient headroom for files and out-guides of at least 10.5 inches. Units must have letter size file trays and security doors.  The quotation must include purchase of new files and installation as separate, identifiable quotes.

2. Dismantle and pack 16 existing units, transport and relocate to North Kent Street and install (re-assemble).

3. Unload medical files from existing Lektrievers at SA-1, transport and relocate them to the new space in SA-15. Re-file all records and re-balance all units.

During relation the vendor will also be expected to make recommendations for any component parts that must be replaced due to excessive wear and tear.

<DESC>The U.S. Special Operations Command is conducting a solicitation for a Quick Release Body Armor Vest that is compatible with the Body Armor Load Carriage System (BALCS) Body Armor (BA) hard plate and soft ballistic shell, and groin protector.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation is being issued as a Request for Proposal and the solicitation number is USZA22-03-R-0027.  The Government intends for this solicitation to result in an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract with a maximum of 25,000 Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) quick release body armor vests. The anticipated duration of the ordering period is from date of award for five years.  The Government estimates ordering an initial quantity of 500 vests, which will constitute the guaranteed minimum for the contract.  This procurement is a 100% set-aside for small business. The NAICS code is 339113 and small business size standard is 500 employees.  *** BEGIN REQUIREMENTS *** Submitted samples will be evaluated based on the following requirements:  The quick releasable vest system shall enable the operator to wear components on the vest as one system.  The system shall allow the present Special Operations Forces Equipment Advanced Requirements (SPEAR) Body Armor with the ballistic filler (soft armor), ballistic upgrade plate (hard armor plate), and groin protector to be worn in the quick release vest. The vest system must have a dual quick release system that allows the operator easy access to the quick release handle.  The vest must allow the user to conveniently don and doff the vest in 30 seconds without cutting it away.  The release system must employ quickly and allow the user to release the vest system quickly and easily without cutting away the material to remove the vest.  It must allow the operator to release the vest using only one hand.  The system shall be sized to fit, with minimum sizes, the 5th to the 95th percentile male operator over Extreme Cold Weather wear (ECW) and Mission Oriented Protective Posture gear (MOPP).  This is an evolution of the BALCS vest.  The intent is to eliminate any repetitive Developmental Testing and Evaluation (DTE).  The most common DTE requirement is the material efficacy.  The BALCSR vest must contain equal or better than the materials incorporated in the original BALCS vest.  This would include, but not limited to, the fabric material (1000 Denier Cordura Nylon), buckle systems, snap systems, and grommets.  The only exception is the likelihood of additional material used for the employment of the release system.  This release mechanism must be constructed of materials that will be compatible with the BALCS vest and capable of meeting solicitation requirements. The system shall be capable of being worn by SOF operators under the parachute harness without causing any increased risk of injury during static airborne operations.  It must drain easily after exposure to submersible water operations.  The threshold for neutral buoyancy is for the body armor vest, minus the plates to remain neutrally buoyant for a period of 5 minutes in salt water.  The objective is for the body armor vest, with plates, to be neutrally buoyant as a unit for a period of 20 minutes or more in salt water.  It must have a shelf life of not less than five years and maintain a service life of 120 days of field use defined as 18 hours of continuous wear while patrolling within each 24-hour period.  It must repair easily with minimal requirements for tools and spare parts.  The external surfaces must provide camouflage for the multiple environments specified in the CLINs, to including woodland, day desert, and black, and must not contribute to visual, infrared (both near and far IR) or audible signature.  Range of motion must include full head rotation, unrestricted ability to tilt head forward and to the rear while in the prone position (to include while wearing a helmet and communications headset; the SPEAR MICH).  The system cannot significantly hinder torso and limb movement /rotation or shouldering and firing the individual weapon from any firing position (without binding at the arms), both right and left handed, prone, kneeling, sitting or standing.  It must accommodate two handed pistol shooting (full extension of both arms).  It must allow the operator to bring his weapon to a good firing position or adjust his firing position without slippage due to the shoulder area of the BA.  It must not hinder or significantly interfere with the operator entering or exiting Sealed Delivery Vehicle (SDV), HUMVEES, hatchways etc.  The system cannot hinder in the execution of infiltration/exfiltration techniques such as rappelling, STABO, FRIES, SPIES etc. It must be compatible with other SPEAR components and items of individual equipment to include but not limited to the ballistic hard plate and soft armor.  Orient the modular pocket/pouches to provide rapid access.  The modular pouches/pockets, NBC mask carriers and canteens will be sized to accommodate similar configurations and requirements that presently exist with other systems such as BALCS.  Questions concerning BALCS should be addressed to this office.  *** BEGIN CONTRACT LINE ITEMS *** CLIN 0001 Vest - Small - Woodland; CLIN 0002 Vest - Medium - Woodland; CLIN 0003 Vest - Large - Woodland; CLIN 0004 Vest - Extra-Large - Woodland; CLIN 0005 Vest - Small - Day Desert; CLIN 0006 Vest - Medium - Day Desert; CLIN 0007 Vest - Large - Day Desert; CLIN 0008 Vest - Extra-Large - Day Desert; CLIN 0009 Vest - Small - Black; CLIN 0010 Vest - Medium - Black; CLIN 0011 Vest - Large - Black; CLIN 0012 Vest - Extra-Large - Black.  *** BEGIN CONTRACT CLAUSES *** 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors; 52.212-1 Addendum - Specific Instructions to Offerors; 52.212-2 Evaluation; 52.212-3 Certifications & Representations; 52.212-4 Contract Terms & Conditions; 52.212-5 FAR Checklist to Implement Statutes; 252.212-7000 Certifications & Representations; 252.212-7001 DFARS Checklist to Implement Statutes; 52.216-18 Ordering; 52.216-19 Order Limitations; 52.216-22 Indefinite Quantity; 5652.216-9001 Oral Orders - IDIQ *** BEGIN 52.212-2 ADDENDUM - EVALUATION FACTORS ***  (1) The evaluation shall consist of two phases.  Phase 1 will be a review of the submitted data and samples to determine whether or not the proposed vests comply with all solicitation requirements.  Phase 2 will consist of Development Testing and Evaluation (DTE) and Operational Testing (DT/OT).  A maximum of 20 test articles will be purchased from offerors remaining in the competitive range based on the results of Phase 1.  Offerors in the competitive range must deliver 6 medium sizes 10 large size and 4 extra large releasable vests within 15-20 days after notification that they remain in the competitive range.  (2)  The evaluation will be comprised of three areas listed in descending order of importance: Technical, Past Performance, and Price.  The Technical Area Criteria are: performance; comfort; functionality.  Technical and Past Performance when combined are significantly more important than price.  All technical criteria are of equal importance.  Offerors must note the evaluation of performance, comfort and functionality will be essentially a subjective assessment by the technical evaluators. (3)  The evaluation will determine the extent to which the contractor has made timely deliveries of a quality product compliant to the requirements on past contracts.  (4) Weight is considered in each of the three technical criteria identified in paragraph 2 above.  Potential offerors should note that lighter weight is better.  Potential offerors should note that additional credit in the evaluation will be given to those vests of lighter weight.
