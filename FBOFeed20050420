<CONTACT>Vickie Gordon, (202) 493-4759
<DESC>This procurement will be conducted under the guidelines of the new policy of the FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) effective April 1, 1996.  AMS 3.2.2.4 allows the FAA to contract with a single source when it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement to procurement Fall Prevention Kits to be added to the Instrument Landing System (ILS) Glide Slope (GS) Towers procured as part of the MARK 20A ILS System as stated in the attached statement of work.  Complete Kits consist of one 10' Top Rail Kit, four 10' Standard Rail Kits, two Trolleys, five10' Ladder Kits, three Work Area Platforms and three Lanyard Clamps.  The kits must meet Occupational Safety & Heath Administration (OSHA) and American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Standards requirements.  Also, the kits must enable safe and convenient access to GS towers for Technicians to perform maintenance.  There are two to three antennas per tower and there is one Glideslope tower per ILS site.  There may be several ILSs (glide slope towers) per airport depending upon the number of runways with ILS approaches. Presently, approximately 160 Thales ATM Mark 20A ILS Glide Slope towers require this kit.  It is anticipated that a total of 200 kits are required through completion of the current Mark 20A contract.   To fulfill this requirement, the FAA intends to negotiate a contract with Radian Communication Services Corporation, 461 Cornwall Road, PO Box 880, Oakville, Ontario, Canada L6J 5C5.  Radian Communication Services Corporation kits are currently installed on several sites within the FAA's Southern and Northwest Mountain regions.   Other manufacturers surveyed by FAA either do not meet OSHA or ANSI standards or are higher priced and not as efficient in terms of allowing technicians to move or inside the tower structure.  FAA will use in-house resources to install the kits. This notice is for information purposes only. No SIR or RFO is available.  Points of contact are Vickie Gordon, 202-493-4759 or Greg Rugila, 202-493-4768.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION OF PROCUREMENT
The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) anticipates a requirement for the development, evaluation, training, trial deployment and support of CAMBRIA devices for the purpose of automated screening of passenger carry-on baggage and divested articles at checkpoints to replace currently deployed carry-on baggage inspection equipment.  As part of the base effort, the Contractor shall design, fabricate, verify, and deliver three operational devices within 12 months after contract award. It is anticipated that there will be three (3) options as part of the effort to include field support services, training, and a technical data package. Option 1, for Field Support Services, includes installation of the three (3) devices not later than 6 months after exercise of option, and maintenance, site service, and logistics for 6 months after the fielding of equipment, with warranty support extending for one year after exercise of option. Option 2 includes development of a training program for the system to be delivered 2 months after exercise of the option. Option 3 is for a Technical Data Package (TDP) to support third party maintenance within 3 months after exercise of the option. 

Note that this is not a formal request for proposal.  TSA will not reimburse any preparation costs associated with responses to this announcement.

The following attachments are available under this announcement, as described below:

Attachment 1: Clearance Sponsorship Form
Attachment 2: Non-Disclosure Statement

SECURITY REQUIREMENTS
The effort will require Contractors to have a CONFIDENTIAL facility and level of safeguarding clearance in accordance with the DD254.  Therefore, the Contractor shall be a participant in the National Industrial Security Program and have a CONFIDENTIAL facility clearance at time of proposal submission since Appendix A to the Technical Requirements Document (TRD) is a key part of this effort and is classified. Those companies who do not currently possess a facility clearance may complete the attached sponsorship form (ATTACHMENT 1 to this synopsis) to be submitted to Mr. Tom Jerdan at Transportation Security Laboratory, TSL-400, Building 315, Atlantic City International Airport, NJ  08405 via email at Thomas.jerdan@dhs.gov or via fax at (609)-383-1973. Note that TSA is not responsible for granting clearances since Defense Security Service administers that process. 



NONDISCLOSURE STATEMENT ATTACHMENT 2
Since the unclassified TRD for this effort is “For Official Use Only,” the Individual who is reviewing the unclassified TRD must sign the attached Non Disclosure Agreement and fax it back by 10 May 2005 at 5:00 p.m., Eastern Standard Time, to the ATTN of Ms. Sheila Roche at 571-227-1372 or 571-227-2911. That individual will be responsible for ensuring that other people in the company that read the TRD follow the same requirements as stated in the NDA.  Those individuals who have signed a Non Disclosure Agreement (NDA) will be emailed the unclassified TRD at a date to be determined, but prior to the pre-proposal conference.  The classified TRD will be provided to only those companies who have the proper clearances.

PRE-PROPOSAL CONFERENCE
After the release of the RFP, it is anticipated that a pre-proposal conference will be held at Transportation Security Laboratory, William J. Hughes Technical Center, Atlantic City, NJ, for one day, sometime during the week of May 16th.  A separate announcement will be published in www.fedbizopps providing details. Those companies wishing to attend the pre-proposal conference shall submit their visit request to Mr. Tom Jerdan at 609-383-1973 by 10 May 2005 at 5:00 pm, Eastern Standard Time.  During the pre-proposal conference, individuals may ask questions concerning the RFP and the procurement process. After the pre-proposal conference, an amendment will be issued which documents questions and answers posed at the pre-proposal conference.

The U.S. Government does not have a security clearance at that level; however, it considers NATO RESTRCITED compatible to EXPORT-CONTROLLED UNCLASSIFIED or BUSINESS SENSITIVE. Prospective bidders are also notified that access to NATO or national military sites for contractor personnel will require a security clearance of NATO SECRET. The successful contractor may be required to handle and or store material at a security level up to and including NATO CONFIDENTIAL.

This is a logical follow-on to contract N00178-02-C-3087 competitively awarded to Purdue University for screening large items for threat chemicals using neutron-gamma techniques.  Purdue possesses unique technical capabilities and specialized experience in the application of the neutron-gamma technology for detecting, identifying, and locating hazardous materials, such as chemical warfare agents (CWA) and toxic industrial chemicals (TICs), in large and small sealed containers.  Purdue has shown the basic feasibility of the technology, however there are still ! additional research and development efforts needed to mature the technology before these prototype systems can progress to the initial development and commercialization stage.  Efforts under this contract will involve optimizing the technology for a given application, and then conducting extensive testing and evaluation to determine its capabilities.  This prototype demonstration effort includes the following tasks: development, fabrication, and evaluation of a complete prototype package scanning system; development, fabrication, and evaluation of a complete prototype small object scanning system; development, fabrication, and evaluation of the next-generation associated particle neutron generator for package imaging; determination of the neutron radiation lethality to biological materials; testing and demonstration of the advanced prototype; and preparation and delivery of technical data and specifications.  These systems will be based on the component technologies that wer! e developed by Purdue under the previous contract.  The results of these efforts will ultimately result in a decision of whether or not to proceed with development and fielding of this technology.   It is anticipated that this solicitation, number N00178-05-R-3050, will be available on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page (http://www.eps.gov) the NECO site (http://www.neco.navy.mil) and the NSWCDD Procurement Division Business Opportunities site (http://www.nswc.navy.mil/wwwDL/XD/SUPPLY/busop.htm) by 11 May 2005.

Specialized knowledge in the areas of foreign mine explosive compounds, construction, inner workings, fuse construction, damage tolerance, and kill/survive criteria is required for completion of this task. IPS is uniquely qualified to provide this services because they provided primary support for the initial team member of the Explosive Test. Work on these projects requires NSWC PC Ordinance Certification Covering Foreign and American mines, MK-80 series bombs and other explosives. There are only two people certified on these systems, one a government  civilian, the other an IPS employee. Any other contractor would be required to duplicate a sig! nificant amount of this previous work in order to establish the knowledge base that IPS has, which is estimated to increase the cost of this effort by more than one hundred percent. Therefore it is imperative that this effort is awarded to Innovative Professional Solutions. The period of performance will be for six (6) months from award. The anticipated award date will be on or about April 27, 2005. Delivery will be to the Naval Support Activity  Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018. NAICS Code 541330 applies. SBA Size Standard is $4M.

<DESC>ENGINEERING AND DESIGN SERVICES FOR VARIOUS MULTI-DISCIPLINE PROJECTS PRIMARILY IN THE STATE OF MAINE

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE TO DOWNLOAD.  ALL INFORMATION REQUIRED TO SUBMIT IS A STANDARD FORM 330.

Engineering and design services are required under an indefinite quantity contract N62472-05-R-6514, for the preparation of architectural and engineering studies, plans, specifications, cost estimates and design-build Requests for Proposals (RFPs) for multi-discipline projects at various locations primarily in the state of ME.  

The preponderance of projects envisioned for these contracts are in the $100,000 - $5M range of estimated construction cost.  Project work may consist of, but is not limited to:  (a) new construction, renovations, alterations, change of use or repairs of office buildings, recreational and research facilities, etc., (b) general repairs of barracks, window wall replacement, utilities, communications and electrical distribution systems, fire and intrusion detection and alarm systems,  (c) site work, oil water separators, etc.

The Naval Facilities Engineering Command is moving towards Design-Build as the preferred method for acquiring capital improvements.  Though Design-Bid-Build methodologies (with the preparation of 100% Plans and Specifications) will continue to be utilized, a significant number will likely require preparation of Requests for Proposal packages for Design-Build solicitations using abbreviated (0% - 30%) design documentation.  Packages would include elements of site/engineering investigation, architectural programming, and functional/performance specifications.

The following services may also be required: facility planning which includes project programming documents, development of requirements, preparation of engineering evaluations, project scope, and unit guidance or parametric cost estimating, development of alternatives and economic analysis; analysis of proposed sites for foundations, utilities, access, constraints and identification of environmental issues; facility design/construction packages, sustainable design analysis and project implementation, design-build Request for Proposal packages, government collateral equipment lists, project preliminary hazard analysis, obtaining permits and regulatory approvals, comprehensive interior design, review of the contractor’s submittals, field consultation and inspection during construction, Title II Inspection, Operation and Maintenance Support Information (OMSI), and as-built drawing preparation.  The initial project will be determined at a later date.  Projects assigned to this contract may include work in the following specialties:  Civil, Structural, Mechanical, Electrical, Fire Protection, Architectural, Interior Design and Landscape Architecture.  

Phases and/or pre-priced contract options may be included and will be exercised at the discretion of the government for 0 – 35%, 35 – 100% design, and post construction contract award services.  Contract award is contingent on availability of funds.  Options are normally exercised within several months of completing prior work; however, delays of up to one year are possible.  Some projects will require design in the metric system.  

As part of this contract, an asbestos and/or lead-based paint assessment may be required to determine the presence of hazardous material during removals/demolition or at utility points of connections.  Firms must be able to accept work that involves asbestos, lead paint, PCB’s, and other hazardous materials.  

Work will be prepared utilizing AutoCAD 2000 or higher.  Specifications will be prepared using SPECINSTACT  program, and cost estimates using the “Success” estimating program in a Work Breakdown Structures (WBS) system format will be utilized. Selected firm will be required to provide documents in pdf format for posting to a Government web site during solicitation.

Firms are advised that the selected firm, its subsidiaries or affiliates that design or prepare specifications for a construction contract cannot provide the construction services for the same contract. This includes concept design, which includes preparation of project programming documents, facility siting studies, environmental assessments, or request for proposals for Design-Build projects, or other activities that result in identification of project scope and cost.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services intends to negotiate with the Boston College Graduate School of Social Work, Boston College Office of Sponsored Programs, 140 Commonwealth Avenue, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467, on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  The purpose of this contract would be to enable the DHHS Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) to assist in funding technical assistance to and oversight/monitoring of states that have received private foundation grants to implement Medicaid program options based on the “cash and counseling” model of consumer-directed home and community-based services.   The period of performance for the contract shall be a base year plus three option years.  The contract will enable ASPE to partner with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in funding a research and technical assistance center (RTAC) at Boston College whose principal purpose is to diffuse the specialized knowledge and expertise about innovative approaches to consumer-directed services gained through the implementation of the original “Cash and Counseling” Demonstration and Evaluation (CCDE) co-sponsored by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) and ASPE.  In 2004, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Retirement Research Fund awarded grants to twelve new states to design and implement “cash and counseling” options within their Medicaid programs similar to those previously implemented in Arkansas, New Jersey, and Florida under the original “Cash and Counseling” Demonstration.   Therefore, a major requirement for the contractor is expertise and experience with regard to the planning and implementation of the CCDE. Boston College has, on staff, the project director for the CCDE, who clearly possesses the relevant expertise and experience.  The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Retirement Research Fund have already awarded grants totally $7.5 million for this initiative to the Boston College School of Social Work and the participating states.  Any other contractor proposing to bid on this contract would have to 1) demonstrate expertise and experience with respect to the “Cash and Counseling” Demonstration and Evaluation sufficient to provide extensive technical assistance to states on how to about replicating the “cash and counseling” innovation in their states and 2) provide a source of funds for approximately half the cost of supporting a research and technical assistance center to diffuse the innovative approach to consumer-directed services delivery pioneered in the CCDE.  The purpose of this synopsis is to determine whether there may be other sources with the requisite qualifications to perform the work described above.  Any organization capable of performing the work should submit a statement of capabilities with documentation supporting its ability to meet the Government’s requirement as described above including a specific statement addressing the second factor listed above (source of additional funding).  No solicitation document is available.  Capability statements should be submitted within 45 days of the publication of this synopsis to the contact point and address given above.  See Note 22.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to procure CA eTrust CleanUp Software maintenance from Computer Associates of Herndon, VA for the period of 6/1/05 through 9/30/07.  This software, formerly known as Advanced Mainframe Identity and Access Management Solution (AKA, The Automated Security Administrator – TASA), was previously available only through Infosec, Inc.  On 3/29/05 Computer Associates acquired this software and became the sole proprietor of the TASA software and its related maintenance.  CA subsequently changed the name of this software to eTrust CleanUp.  The eTrust CleanUp software produces top secret audit reports, and on an ongoing basis, dynamically assists with the monitoring and cleanup of system security files and/or resources.  Other organizations that believe they are capable of meeting SSA’s requirements are invited to submit information concerning their capabilities, experience, and other pertinent data. Pricing data may be submitted. This is not a request for proposal and the Government does not intend to pay for information submitted. Requests for copies of a solicitation will not be honored or acknowledged. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation of the information received. No contract award will be made on the basis of responses received; however, this information will be used in SSA's assessment of capable sources. Verbal responses are not acceptable and will not be considered. Responses to this notice must be submitted by 4/29/05. Responses can be sent via email to Angie Landis at Angie.Landis@ssa.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

General Characteristics:  The Dome Shelters are a group of shelters used for a variety of applications including warehousing and as an aircraft hanger.  The shelters do not require a foundation and can be erected on both a smooth natural site relatively free of surface rock or on a pre-existing concrete pad.  The domes consist of an aluminum arched frame, tensioned weatherproof fabric, and an electrical system.  The shelters can be erected and disassembled from ground level.  All tools necessary for erection and disassembly are included in the shelter package.  The various configurations have different lengths, door types, end walls, and electrical systems.

The 4K Dome Shelter (5410-01-363-0090EJ) has two Big Mouth Doors that span the shelter width.  It is approximately 60 feet by 60 feet yielding a square footage on the order of 4000 square feet.  The 8K Dome Shelter (5410-01-494-5130EJ) also has two Big Mouth Doors, but has twice as many body panels, approximately doubling the length of the shelter.  The 4K Dome Shelter (5410-01-455-2004EJ) with gabled (flat) end wall is similar to the 4K Dome Shelter, but a flat end all replaces one of the Big Mouth Doors.

The Dome Hanger Extension Assembly (5410-01-500-7537EJ) is not a stand alone item.  It contains the components to create a Dome Hanger Extension Assembly (5410-01-512-3416EJ) that is approximately 5000 square feet, from an existing 4K.  The dome extension contains additional aluminum frame, replacement fabric for the entire shelter, a replacement lighting system, and additional component, including electrical.

Dome Shelters and the Dome Extension Assembly each will require a First Article.  Condition(s) for Waiver of First Article Approval:  Offerors currently in production of the same or similar article for an Air Force contract and who have received First Article approval under the existing contract or offerors who have previously furnished production quantities of the same or similar articles to the Air Force, provided articles thus furnished, have exhibited satisfactory performance in service in the opinion of the Air Force or provided not more than 60 months have elapsed since completion of the contract.

Electronic procedures will be posted for this solicitation on or around 15 Apr 05 and will be posted under RFP FA8518-05-R-75816 at http://www.fedbizops.gov/.  Government Data/Drawings will be available for these items and will be posted with the solicitation.

General:  This is a Sources Sought Notice only. No solicitation is being issued at this time. For reference purposes, the solicitation, when issued, will be numbered FA8902-05-R-1000. This Sources Sought Notice is also issued for the purpose of market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10. All businesses capable of providing these services are invited to respond. Any information provided by industry to the Government as a result of this sources sought synopsis is voluntary. The Government will not pay for any information submitted in response to this sources sought synopsis.  The amount of information available for publication at this time is limited. The solicitation, when issued, will be a Request for Proposal (RFP). A best value source selection will likely be the method of contractor selection. The Human Systems Group, Brooks City-Base, TX, seeks potential sources to perform a variety of non-personal Advisory and Assistance Services (A&AS) and services in support of Human Systems Group (HSG) and 311th Human Systems Wing (HSW) staff, tenant, and associate organizations. One or more of these organizations may be located outside the local area.  The required functional area support includes program management, information management, engineering, logistics, testing and analysis, and scientific photographic support. The value of this program is expected to be $60M with a possible increase up to 30%.  Contract Type:  The contract type has not yet been determined.  However, the government is contemplating awarding multiple Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity Firm-Fixed-Price/Time and Material type contracts.   Performance Period:  The issuing period for task orders will be 60 months, beginning from contract award, with an additional 12 months beyond the ordering period for task order completion.  North American Industry Classification Systems Code:  The government anticipates using NAICS Code 541330 “Engineering Services” with a size standard of $23M.  Set-Aside:   The small business set-aside, if any, has not been determined. Other:  Additional information, as it becomes available, will be posted as amendments to this announcement. All amendments will be available for viewing on FedBizOps (FBO) at http://www.eps.gov. It is incumbent upon the interested parties to review the site frequently for any updates and amendments to any and all documents. All potential offerors are reminded, in accordance with Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations (DFARS) 252.204-7004, Required Central Contractor Registration, lack of registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) will make an offeror ineligible for contract award. Market Research: The Draft Statement of Work (SOW) is provided for your review and comment.  Additionally, please provide responses to the following:
1.  The government requests interested parties submit a brief description of their company's business size, business status (small disadvantaged business, HUBzone, women-owned, service disabled veteran owned small business, and HBCU/MI), and whether they are interested as a prime or subcontractor, anticipated teaming arrangements, and a description of similar services offered to the Government and to commercial customers.   Include contract magnitude and points of contact for each example provided (name of the point of contact (POC), address, e-mail, telephone number, fax number, and the company's web page, if applicable). If you are an 8(a) what is your graduation date from the program?
2.  For this type of work, what are the actual percentages and dollars in subcontracting to small business and all sub-categories (small disadvantaged business, women owned small business, HUBZone small business, service disabled veteran owned small businesses and HBCU/MI)?
3.  What socio-economic programs (e.g. Mentor Protégé, Indian Incentive, etc) you participate in?   What is the extent of your participation in these programs?
4.  Do you plan to joint venture for this effort?
5.  The following questions apply to task orders issued against the IDIQ contract:
      a. Should there be a mandatory proposal structure for individual, competed task orders?  If so, provide suggestions.
     b. Should there by page limits on task order proposals?  If so, provide suggestions.
     c. Should options be allowed on task orders?  If so, what type of criteria should be used to determine which task orders may contain options and which may not (e.g. severable vs. non-severable work)?  How many options years should we allow on each task order?
     d. Determination of what constitutes a new task order requirement versus an in-scope task order modification or logical follow-on task order is a Contracting Officer decision.  Keeping in mind that a multiple award contract is a means to promote competition during the life of the contract, what type of criteria should the Government use as a baseline to make this determination?
6.  Do you have any suggestions on the Service Delivery Summary items and Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan?

Please limit your response to question above to not more than 10 single-sided pages. Comments on the SOW are unlimited.  Each submission should include one electronic (virus scanned) copy sent via e-mail to the POCs listed in this synopsis.

<CONTACT>Thomas Bikowski 202-781-2819
<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities(FBO) page located at http://www.eps.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line(NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil. While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable. Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command. 17.	This announcement was initially published on 31 March 2005.  This amendment to the sources sought announcement extends the due date for notices of interest from 2 May 2005 to 16 May 2005.  Accordingly, the announcement is hereby restated as follows: The purpose of this announcement is to determine if there are interested sources for the replacement of solenoid-operated pilot valves (SOPV) currently in use aboard US Navy ships, or which may be used in future systems.  The valves are currently constructed in accordance NAVSEA Standard Drawing 803-5959218, and most commonly are installed in systems depicted in NAVSEA Standard Drawing 803-5959273.   These drawings may be referred to for an understanding of the functionality of the device, and its current mounting configuration.  Electronic copies of these drawings can be found at the Navy Logistics Library as follows: Go to:  http://www.nll.navsup.navy.mil/ Click:  PUBS/PRODUCTS/TOOLS Click:  NAVSUP DIGITAL DOCUMENTS Click:  Radio Button for NAVICP CONTRACT SUPPORT LIBRARY Click:  DOCUMENT TYPE drop down and select NAVSEA DOCUMENTS Click:  SEARCH Click:  DOCUMENT # SEA0010 Open:  Drawing 803-5959273 or Drawing 803-5959218D Note that mounting configuration and valve type shown, are not intended to indicate limitations at this point.  Instead, this information is to provide an understanding of the functionality of the device and interface connections in existing systems.  The valves must be suitable for use in a Naval combatant ship.  The valve is subject to long periods during which it is not operated, up to several months, after which it may cycle several times in a day, and then be static again for several months.  The seawater being controlled by the valve is from the ship’s firemain (normally 150 to 175 lb/in2) and contains substantial contaminants due to the coarse strainers used in these systems.  Any type of operator may be considered, such as pneumatic, hydraulic, electro-mechanical, etc.  Pneumatic or hydraulic operators would be self-contained, not requiring connection to systems other than electrical (120 or 440 VAC) and seawater.   Current areas of concern with the SOPV are leakage ! through the valve shaft seal progressing into the area of the electrical operator, electro-mechanical interface alignment and ease with which the interface comes out of alignment.  Scoring of lapped surfaces from grit has also been a concern.  As an alternative to the SOPV, direct-operated valves could replace both the SOPV’s and the valves they control, the Hycheck and Powercheck valves shown in drawing, NAVSEA No. 803-5959273.  Interested companies should submit, on company letterhead and no later than 16 May 2005, a notice of interest including the name, telephone number, mailing address, and e-mail address of one point of contact to Commander, Naval Sea Systems Command, Attn: Douglas Barylski SEA 05P4, 1333 Isaac Hull SE Mail Stop 5149, Washington Navy Yard, DC 20376-5149.  Questions regarding this announcement should be directed to Doug Barylski at 202-781-3612.  The notice of interest should include a brief description of your company and its capabilities and experienc! e that relate to valve and/or mechanical device design and manufacture, brochures, top level drawings showing basic dimensions of possible devices, reliability data such as mean time between failure for proposed or similar devices, and any related information that will assist the Navy in assessing SOPV replacement possibilities.  Multiple alternatives for either future installation or backfit, or both, are welcomed.

<DESC>This is an amendment to the original souces sought.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) is conducting market research, FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY, to identify: small; small disadvantaged; women-owned; 8(a); HUB Zone and service disabled veteran-owned business concerns that possess the necessary technical capabilities to provide Multi-Media, Multi Concentration Inorganic Sample Analyses for USEPA?s Office of Superfund Remediation Technology Innovation (OSRTI).  The information attained as a result of this announcement will be used to determine the extent to which this acquisition will be set aside for small business concerns. This requirement will satisfy a need for qualified laboratories to apply USEPA Contract Laboratory Program (CLP) analytical methods for the isolation, detection, quantitative measurement, and reporting of 23 metals (including mercury) and cyanide target analytes in water/aqueous, soil/sediment/wipes, and air environmental samples.  The labs must have the capability to analyze samples by Inductively Coupled Plasma - Atomic Emission Spectrometer (ICP-AES), Inductively Coupled Plasma - Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS), Cold Vapor Atomic Absorption (CVAA), and colorimetric measurement of cyanide.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541380. The USEPA intends to award multiple indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity type contracts with a one-year base period and four 12-month option periods to meet the USEPA?s sample analyses need of 96,000 samples per year. Detailed information on the analytical requirements is provided via the draft Inorganic Low Medium 06.X (ILM06.X) Statement of Work (SOW) and its associated exhibits/appendices which are posted to the following web page: (http://www.epa.gov/superfund/programs/clp/ilm6.htm).  The ILM SOW is a protocol that will define the inorganic methods and procedures accepted by the CLP.  In addition, the electronic deliverable for the inorganics will be based on staged electronic data deliverable (SEDD) Stage 3.  Although SEDD Stage 3 is not yet completed for the inorganics, the overall structure will be similar to the requirements posted for the organics (http://www.epa.gov/superfund/programs/clp/som1.htm).  To evaluate the potential number of laboratories capable of adequately performing under the ILM SOW, a thorough review of laboratory capability statements, written Quality Assurance Plan (QAP), and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) will be made. Laboratories responding to this sources sought synopsis are requested to provide the USEPA all appropriate documentation that would assure the USEPA that for any possible future contract with the CLP, the laboratory will be able to:  (1) Adhere to a written QAP containing the elements described under Exhibit E, Section 5 of the SOW;  (2) Adhere to SOPs containing the elements described under Exhibit E, Section 6 of the SOW;  (3) Adhere to the analytical methods detailed in Exhibit D and associated QC requirements specified in Exhibit E of the SOW;  (4) Verify and document analytical standards and retain documentation of the purity of neat materials, as well as the purity and accuracy of solutions obtained from private chemical supply houses;  (5) Submit all raw data and required documentation for Regional review;  (6) Submit results of all analyzed laboratory evaluation samples, including adherence to corrective action procedures;  (7) Submit, upon request, instrument data tapes and applicable documentation for tape audits, including a copy of the Sample Data Package;  (8) Submit on-site laboratory evaluations, and adhere to corrective action procedures; and  (9) Submit all original documentation generated during sample analyses for USEPA review. Documentation required to be submitted during the sources sought by each laboratory for evaluation by the USEPA include the following: 1) Quality Assurance Plan.  The laboratory shall submit a written QAP meeting the intent of Exhibit E, Sections 5.1 through 5.1.2 of the SOW.  The QAP shall include all elements detailed in Exhibit E, Section 5.2 of the SOW.  For the purposes of the sources sought announcement, each separate element of the QAP shall be written to detail practices of the laboratory that serve to meet the intent of each specific requirement of the SOW.  All elements required in Section 5.2, Parts A through G must be included in the QAP. 2) Standard Operating Procedures.  The laboratory shall submit written SOPs meeting the intent of Exhibit E, Sections 6.0 through 6.3.12, and Exhibit F, Sections 3.0 through 3.7.2., of the SOW.  Each SOP shall include all elements concerning SOPs detailed in Exhibit E and F of the SOW.  For the purposes of the sources sought announcement, each separate element of the SOP shall detail practices of the laboratory that serve to meet the intent of each specific requirement of the SOW.  All elements required in these Sections must be included in the SOPs. 3) Capabilities Statement Manual.  The laboratory shall submit a written capabilities statement detailing the following:  a. Organizational chart listing key personnel, including section managers, analysts, sample receiving personnel, Quality Assurance staff, and IT personnel that would participate in the performance of a contract under the SOW, and a copy of the job description and/or other documentation outlining the duties and responsibilities of the laboratory Quality Assurance Manager.

North American Industry Classification Systems Code:  The government anticipates using NAICS Code 541330 “Engineering Services” with a size standard of $23M.  Set-Aside:   The small business set-aside, if any, has not been determined. Other:  Additional information, as it becomes available, will be posted as amendments to this announcement. All amendments will be available for viewing on FedBizOps (FBO) at http://www.eps.gov. It is incumbent upon the interested parties to review the site frequently for any updates and amendments to any and all documents. All potential offerors are reminded, in accordance with Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations (DFARS) 252.204-7004, Required Central Contractor Registration, lack of registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) will make an offeror ineligible for contract award. Market Research: The Draft Statement of Work (SOW) is provided for your review and comment.  Additionally, please provide responses to the following:
1.  The government requests interested parties submit a brief description of their company's business size, business status (small disadvantaged business, HUBzone, women-owned, service disabled veteran owned small business, and HBCU/MI), and whether they are interested as a prime or subcontractor, anticipated teaming arrangements, and a description of similar services offered to the Government and to commercial customers.   Include contract magnitude and points of contact for each example provided (name of the point of contact (POC), address, e-mail, telephone number, fax number, and the company's web page, if applicable). If you are an 8(a) what is your graduation date from the program?
2.  For this type of work, what are the actual percentages and dollars in subcontracting to small business and all sub-categories (small disadvantaged business, women owned small business, HUBZone small business, service disabled veteran owned small businesses and HBCU/MI)?
3.  What socio-economic programs (e.g. Mentor Protégé, Indian Incentive, etc) you participate in?   What is the extent of your participation in these programs?
4.  Do you plan to joint venture for this effort?
5.  The following questions apply to task orders issued against the IDIQ contract:
      a. Should there be a mandatory proposal structure for individual, competed task orders?  If so, provide suggestions.
     b. Should there by page limits on task order proposals?  If so, provide suggestions.
     c. Should options be allowed on task orders?  If so, what type of criteria should be used to determine which task orders may contain options and which may not (e.g. severable vs. non-severable work)?  How many options years should we allow on each task order?
     d. Determination of what constitutes a new task order requirement versus an in-scope task order modification or logical follow-on task order is a Contracting Officer decision.  Keeping in mind that a multiple award contract is a means to promote competition during the life of the contract, what type of criteria should the Government use as a baseline to make this determination?
6.  Do you have any suggestions on the Service Delivery Summary items and Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan?

Please limit your response to question above to not more than 10 single-sided pages. Comments on the SOW are unlimited.  Each submission should include one electronic (virus scanned) copy sent via e-mail to the POCs listed in this synopsis.

<SUBJECT>D--Digitization of Medical Credentials
<SOLNBR>N688365110RFI
<RESPDATE>050505
<CONTACT>Robert Woolwine (904) 542-1063
<DESC>BACKGROUND: 1.  The Naval Healthcare Support Office (HSO) is exploring the alternative of  procuring contractor support to digitize and upload documents contained within approximately 17,000 paper credential files located at a minimum of 70 Navy facilities throughout the world into an existing Department of Defense (DoD) searchable database. 2.  The Department of Defense (DoD) and the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals Organization (JCAHO) require each accredited Military Treatment Facility (MTF) to perform privileging of military and civilian health care providers practicing in their facility.  This entails a complete review and verification of a provider’s Individual Credential File (ICF) (licensing, training, education, specialty information, assignment history data, etc) to determine qualifications and competency prior to being granted “privileges” to perform duties at the MTF.  For those health care positions that do not require privileging, a complete review and verification of an Individual Professional File (IPF) for determination of qualifications and job-specific competency is still required.  On the average, each ICF contains approximately 300 pages of documentation and each IPF contains approximately 200 pages of documentation.  The availability of an electronic ICF or IPF with digitized ! documents organized in a manner similar to paper ICFs/IPFs is desired to provide instantaneous availability of a complete, quality electronic credential record, which can be viewed along side the provider on-line application.  Collectively, this will reduce the time for privileging providers.  3.  Currently, the Navy utilizes a searchable web-based application, the Centralized Credentials Quality Assurance System (CCQAS), hosted at a secure government facility to provide worldwide credential, risk management, and adverse action data on military and civilian health care workers.  CCQAS contains provider demographic, licensing, training, education, privileges, medical readiness/mobilization, specialty, and assignment history data as well as provides real-time access to status of investigations, hearings, and due processes.  In order to automate and expedite the privileging of providers practicing at each MTF, CCQAS Version 2.8 is being developed to allow providers to complete an on-line application at time of reappointment and to have an unlimited number of scanned images to be associated with an individual provider’s credentials record.    NOTIONAL CONCEPT: To meet the need described above, the The Naval Healthcare Support Office (HSO) envisions procuring contractor support to coordinate with the DoD Resource Information Technology Program Office (RITPO) to commonly identify and map each data element/document of an ICF/IPF file that will be digitized and uploaded into CCQAS Version 2.8.  The specific digitized file format to be used must also be determined.  After establishing all interfaces and parameters required, the contractor support staff would digitize and upload specified data elements/documents contained within approximately 17,000 paper credential files located at a minimum of 70 facilities throughout the world into CCQAS. The digitized documents within the ICF/IPF must be organized such that they can be uploaded into the document type cateories defined by CCQAS version 2.8 and represent the contents of a six section ICF/IPF in accordance with BUMED Instruction 6320.66D.  All information uploaded to CCQAS would requir! e verification that the upload was successful, all scanned documentation is retrievable, the digitized files are legible, any keyed (typed) information is accurate, and information is organized in accordance with BUMED Instruction.  A potential requirement exists to train Navy personnel on the process to digitize, maintain, and upload future provider credential files. SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS:		 1.  An ICF/IPF is not a static file.  Commanding Officers within the Department of Navy must ensure information contained in the ICFs and IPFs are monitored, continually updated, and reported to CCQAS quarterly.   2. The ICF/IPF contains information covered by the Privacy Act and must be treated as such at all times.   RESPONSES: No contract will be awarded as a result of this RFI.  The Government will not pay for costs associated with developing a response to this RFI.  No other information is available to respondents.  To be of greatest value, responses should be received by close of business,  May 5 , 2005.  Electronic submissions (email with Microsoft Word attachment) are desired.  Attachments should be no longer than 20 pages.  Please send responses to Robert Woolwine.  Responses should address the following areas:    COMMENTS ON OBJECTIVES AND NOTIONAL: 1.  Is the notional concept the best way to meet the HSO objectives?  Why or why not?   2.  Address how the worldwide digitization effort will be managed.  Will digitization efforts be performed simulatneously worldwide, or will one team move from site to site until all Navy records are digitized?  Address how the digitization concept can be constructed and performed within the parameters of the Privacy Act and the dynamic nature of the ICFs/IPFs.    Address how the coordination and interfacing with RITPO will be accomplished.  What metrics are meaningful for the various stages of the contract –coordination and interface with RITPO, digitization of files, uploading of files, and potential follow-on training requirements? 3.  Address what type of labor categories would be necessary to accomplish the various objectives within the concept.  How does industry tyically price these types of services?  What are the typical rates for that type of pricing structure?  What is a ball-park budgetary estimate within the market/industry for the requirement described ? 4. What is the estimated timeline required to complete the digitization effort of approximately 17,000 files located throughout the world?   5.  What Government resources would be expected to be supplied for the effort described? 6.  What evaluation criteria are particularly meaningful, considering the challenges faced with to stay within compliance with BUMED Instruction?   7.  Describe any other challenges or special considerations the Government should take into account for the digitization contract is initiated.      CAPABILITIES STATEMENT: 1.  Tell us about your organization and its capabilities to meet the HSO’s objectives.  Identify your organization’s salient characteristics:  small or large business, for profit or not for profit, university or consortium, etc.    2.  Identify your organization’s relevant experience with respect to HSO’s objectives. 3.  You may identify current or prospective teaming partners, their salient characteristics, and relevant experience.

<SUBJECT>Y -- Convenience Store Prototype
<DESC>Headquarters Army and Air Force Exchange Service Request for Information
Headquarters Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES) mission is to provide quality merchandise and services of necessity and convenience to authorized customers at uniformly low prices; and generate reasonable earnings to supplement appropriated funds for the support of Army and Air Force Morale, Welfare, and Recreation Programs.  
AAFES is charged with generating reasonable earnings, but returns every cent to the customer.  A non-appropriated fund activity (NAF) of the Department of Defense, AAFES funds 98% of its operating budget (civilian employee salaries, inventory investments, utilities and capital investments for equipment, vehicles and facilities) from the sale of merchandise, food and services to customers.
The AAFES Real Estate Directorate is responsible for executing over $100M annually in new construction and renovation projects for retail operations at military installations worldwide.  We contract with Architecture/Engineering firms to design our shoppettes (convenience stores), shopping centers, gas stations, fast food restaurants, mini malls (small shopping centers), and more.  We then competitively solicit these projects with local, regional, and national general contractors for construction services,

We currently have a requirement for the development and construction of a prototype “C” store which is known by our customers as a shoppette or convenience store.  We have enclosed our prospective contract statement of work for your review with the expectation that your firm would be interested in providing us feedback and suggestions to improve this product before we issue a solicitation.  This is a unique contract effort where AAFES is seeking a single contractor to conduct commercial convenience store market research, incorporate the results of this research into a prototype design, construct the facility at potentially numerous locations throughout the United States and possibly overseas, and then refresh the design and specifications periodically to keep the prototype at the leading edge of convenience store consumer satisfaction.  We request your input be at no charge to AAFES and limited to no more than ten written pages.  Any submittals your company makes may be incorporated in our final solicitation documents.  At your option you may also be added to our source list for notification when we are ready to solicit this project.  Please provide your input by 4 May 2005 by emailing it to calnanj@aafes.com and questions should be emailed to the same address.

In addition to your comments regarding the enclosed statement of work, please respond to the questions below to further assist AAFES in developing a more accurate, concise, and coherent statement of work.

1.  Typically General Contractors and A/E firms don’t utilize the skills of a marketing firm nor do they maintain and update designs on a long term basis.  Is there a barrier to overcome for your firm to provide this service?

2.  Does your company have the capability to perform all aspects of this statement of work?

3.  Is it realistic to expect A/E and general contractor firms to perform all aspects of this statement of work?

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Applied Biosystems, 850 Lincoln Centre Dr., Foster City, CA.,  for a 3130 Genetic Analyzer.  The instrument  required is a 4-capillary, fluorescence-based genetic analysis system. It must be fully automated from polymer loading and replacement, DNA separation, detection, and data analysis. Run conditions must be optimized for several applications, such as de novo or comparative DNA sequencing and DNA fragment analysis. A full complement of chemistry kits, software, and accessory products should be available from the vendor.  The instrument must be capable of analyzing multiple runs of samples—4 samples per run. The system must be fully automated from polymer loading to analyzed sequence or size-called results. The instrument must use a computer workstation for instrument operation and data analysis—specifically a Dell  Workstation running a Windows XP or higher operating system. The Windows  XP operating system should also be designed for networking with a larger laboratory management-computing environment.  The system should use software for sample import and instrument control that can regulate the functions of the instrument and automatically process the data once the instrument has detected it. It must also provide several options for instrument diagnostics and automatic import of sample plate information. The instrument must use analysis software and algorithms that perform either basecalling for DNA sequencing or size calling for DNA fragment analysis. One application software type must be included with the purchase of the instrument system, the other must be available to be selected as an add-on kit. Data files should be generated in industry standard ABIF format, which must be viewed on a Windows computing system. The instrument must operate without user intervention (unattended) for 24-hours with a sample processing throughput greater than 144 sequencing or 144 fragment analysis samples per 24-hours. The system must be able to detect and analyze five fluorescent dyes simultaneously.  The instrument must have: four capillaries, automated polymer delivery system, autoloading of samples performed from a single 96-well microtiter plate, CCD detection technology and a spectrograph for color separation,  simultaneous dual-side illumination detection system to maximize signal uniformity and sensitivity that in turn reduces the requirements placed on the user for sample preparation and cleanup, active temperature cooling/heating that can maintain temperatures from 15 to 65 degrees C., a thermally stable detection region of the capillary array.  Reagents optimized for use with this instrument must be available through the instrument’s vendor.  The vendor must supply application-specific kits that are optimized for the instrument in the area of human identification, agriculture, molecular microbiology, and genetic disease research .  The instrument must include software that has:  electronic sample information that can be automatically imported from an external data-handling system,  chemometric algorithmic processing of raw signal data,  basecalling and size-calling algorithms that have been optimized for data from the instrument,  instrument verification to check status of critical system components, available options for further downstream data analysis and data management,  ability to run sequencing and fragment samples on a single plate, ability for the user to customize the run order,  security, audit trail and electronic signature features that assist with 21 CFR Part 11 requirements.. The system’s capillary arrays and polymers must have the following specifications:  support for POP-4™, POP-6™, and POP-7™ Polymers, dynamically coat the capillary walls to control for electro-osmotic flow,  have capillary arrays consisting of 4 capillaries,  have capillary arrays available in four different sizes: 22 cm, 36 cm, 50 cm, and 80 cm,  employ capillary arrays that use bare silica capillaries with a useful life that exceeds 150 runs.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items and services in accordance with FAR Part 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this solicitation.  This synopsis/solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through FAC 2005-02.  This notice constitutes the only solicitation; a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation, PS05-P008, is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).  This acquisition is set-aside for Small Business and is  open to GSA federal supply schedule holders.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 337215 Showcase, Partition, Shelving, and Locker Manufacturing.  The size standard is 500 employees.  

General Requirements:  NSF is looking to maximize the storage capacity of its 980 sq ft (8'6"x36'5"x24'7") library.  This objective can be achieved through redesign of the area, new shelving alternatives or a combination of both.  The library anticipates a growth rate of 5% per year.  The floor load capacity throughout the library was designed to carry 200 P.S.F.  To request a copy of the floor plan of the space in question, send an email to dharris@nsf.gov.  Note that NSF will entertain requests to view the space.  Requests must be made via email to dharris@nsf.gov, and for scheduling purposes, must be made 48 hours in advance.  The space within the cloud on the floor plan must remain intact.  All or part of the space outside of the clouded area may be reconfigured to maximize storage space in the library, as determined by the offeror.  However, all space must be compliant with the Arlington County Fire Codes and meet all ADA requirements.  The equipment within the reconfigurable space that must reside somewhere within the library space is as follows: one microfilm/microfiche reader; one magnifier; two computers with monitors inside the NSF firewall; and one computer with monitor outside of the NSF firewall.  Consideration should be taken when identifying locations for the equipment, ease of use, accessibility and security; all of these items will be considered when reviewing the placement of the equipment in all submissions.  Offerors may opt to mount furnishings to the walls.  However, offerors must verify that there are no conflicts that would prohibit the instillation and provide all reinforcement to unsure stability and prevent damage from falling.  NSF has two requirements for offerors to consider when submitting proposals for this requirement; units must have canopies to protect library materials from possible water damage and if a mobile system is proposed an electrical system would have a higher preference than mechanical unless the offeror can demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, best design and better value of an alternative.  NSF currently has no intention of changing the lighting in the space.  If lighting becomes an issue to the offeror, they should address it in their proposal as an option for consideration by NSF.  

The construction of the NSF building is not post tension cable.  Although attaching shelving components to the floor is acceptable it is not mandatory.  Offerors must detail, in their proposals, how the units will be stabilized, as there can be no risk of shelving falling over; all stabilization plans will be reviewed by NSF’s building management company.  

Special Note:  Be advised that the successful offer, as part of any award, must hire a structural engineer to review the instillation design and the NSF structural drawings to determine if the existing structure can carry the load.  The cost and schedule for this requirement must be included in all proposals submitted.  

Current Library Collection:  NSF’s physical collection contains approximately 20,000 books, videos, and periodicals, approximately 1,500 cassettes and approximately 50,000 microfiche.  NSF displays one year’s worth of 180 printed journals, as well as displaying five newspapers for 28 days.  The library currently has 14 banks of magazine display shelves; 4 ranges of 9 banks each with 6 shelves per bank, 4 ranges of 7 banks each with 6 shelves per bank.  There are 12 banks of reference materials in various locations; one locking cabinet with six shelves of video materials, additional lockable cabinets are needed as expansion is anticipated in this area.  Microfilm is maintained in one cabinet with 12 drawers, 5 rows per drawer, maximum capacity is 26 cassettes per row.  Microfiche is maintained in one cabinet with 12" deep rows, 6 rows per shelf, 12 shelves; and one cabinet with 24"deep drawers, 2 rows per drawer, 4 drawers.  Neither the microfilm nor the microfiche collections are expected to grow.  NSF expects growth in the area of CDs and DVDs.  In addition to accommodating the current library collection NSF requires options for display space of newspapers and periodicals maintained in the library.  Reuse of the library’s existing materials (shelving, cabinets, etc.) is allowable but not required.  Offerors should make their best effort to offer the best value to NSF for consideration.  

Library Usage:  The library welcomes approximately 7,800 NSF staff on an annual basis and a minimal number of visitors from the public sector.    The NSF staff is represented by a mixture of full time NSF employees as well as rotators on assignment to NSF for specific periods of time; therefore layout, signage and ease of use will be considerations when reviewing proposals.    

Instillation Requirements:  This RFP requires the design, dismantlement of the current library, off-site storage of all materials, instillation of the accepted design, reshelving of all library materials utilizing the current Library of Congress shelving system, and testing of all moveable parts and components.  Offerors must be able to demonstrate their capability to perform all services required; however, NSF will look closely at the plan to dismantle, store and reshelve library materials.  The NSF library collection does not contain classified materials.  The off-site storage facility must however, be appropriate for the storage for the media being stored.  Plans for off-site storage must be included in the response to this RFP.  NSF anticipates no significant problems gaining access to the two freight elevators at the facility.  However, there are several contractors on-site utilizing the freight elevators during the course of a day, and usage must be scheduled.  

Work Schedule:  Offerors must include in their response to this RFP a schedule implementation plan.  The plan should make every effort to reduce downtime of the library, while keeping costs reasonable.  
Be advised that NSF and it’s building manager CARR are currently in the process of replacing the carpet throughout the building.  Therefore, the existing carpet will not remain in the library space.  Also the library shelving project and the carpeting project will be scheduled simultaneously to reduce the amount of down time and disruption to library patrons.  Take this into consideration when devising a proposed instillation plan.  

Evaluation Factors:  Subject to the availability of funds, NSF intends to issue a fixed price order based on this solicitation.  Offers will be evaluated based on the pricing offered to the Government; the ability to meet the requirement; design concept; capability to manage and coordinate the project, and past performance.  To assist in evaluating past performance the offeror must submit points of contact for three contracts performed in the past two years that most closely match this requirement.  At least one contract must have been with the Government.  The award will be based on the best value to the Government in conjunction with these factors.    

Contract Clauses and Solicitation Provisions: The full text of clauses may be accessed electronically at www.acqnet.gov/far.  The following clauses and provisions apply to this solicitation:
52.252-2, Clauses Incorporated by Reference; 52.212-1 (Feb 1998), Instructions to Offerors – Commercial Items (Jan 2005); 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications – Commercial Items (Mar 2005); 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statues or Executive Orders – Commercial Items (Jan 2005); 52-212-2, Evaluation – Commercial Items (Jan 1999);

to offer a competitively priced proposal.  If I am over estimate the time required, my price may not be competitive with another proposal that underestimates the time required.  Will you instead accept an 'estimated' number of training days and judge the proposal on a 'per-day' fee basis?
30.	‘per-day’ fee is acceptable, bearing in mind that a two-day model is preferred.  The training shall not exceed two days.  This is the maximum time allowed for this training for senior management.  

31.	My training firm owns a proprietary 360 degree feedback instrument.  We offer a 'standard' 70 question 360 feedback instrument which has proved quite useful for the majority of our clients.  However, we can also tailor the instrument to specifically model the NIDA Leadership Competency Model, including an entirely new set of instrument questions.  Tailoring the 360 to NIDA specific language makes the instrument more expensive.  Can I offer two prices for the 360 feedback reports for 27 NIDA managers, one price for the 'standard' instrument and one price for the NIDA specific instrument? 
32.	Pricing can be developed both ways.  However, we want a NIDA specific tool to be used for evaluative purposes.  We also want MBTI, FIRO-B, and the 360 degree feedback psychological assessment tools to be used.

This can be accomplished by documenting both public and private sector experience in this area as well as consultant academic training in this field of expertise.  The primary consultant must hold Ph.D. in organizational psychology.  The primary recipients of the NIDA leadership training are physicians and research scientists.  The Ph.D. credential makes the trainer more creditable to a scientific audience.  As a research organization all of the NIDA staff participating in this training are research scientists.      

38.	Solicitation Item # 3 states: “ Once the Competency Model has been approved the vendor will design training that will help select group (7) to become effective leaders. “ Are there 7 distinct groups of leaders? If not, please clarify the meaning of 7.

The competency model will be designed based on current management practices that have been determined to be effective in both the public and private sectors.

ACQUISITION REQUIREMENTS ARE FOR NEW MATERIAL ONLY.  The items being procured are end items.  Acquisition requirements are for new material only.  The items being procured are piece parts used in the repair of the ATF3 engine and associated components.

ALL parts must be OEM certified or if the awardee is other than the OEM, the awardee must be capable of providing OEM manufactured parts with traceability.

ACQUISITION REQUIREMENTS ARE FOR NEW MATERIAL ONLY.  The items being procured are end items.  Acquisition requirements are for new material only.  The items being procured are piece parts used in the repair of the ATF3 engine and associated components.

All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Agency.  Sources shall be certified by the FAA or the OEM.  ALL parts must be OEM certified or if the awardee is other than the OEM, the awardee must be capable of providing OEM manufactured parts with traceability.
