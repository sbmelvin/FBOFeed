<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;">PROJECT DESCRIPTION</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;">Background Information: The National Institute on Aging (NIA) Intramural Research Program (IRP) is embarking on a longitudinal study of the effects of race and socioeconomic status on healthy aging in a representative sample of community dwelling residents from the Baltimore metropolitan region. The need to understand the sources of persistent health disparities in overall longevity, cardiovascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease has led to the development of the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span (HANDLS) study. The HANDLS is planned as a 20-year longitudinal study.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;">PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;">The purpose of this potential requirement is to provide the expertise necessary to implement a nutritional monitoring program as part of the HANDLS. It requires a detailed knowledge of the public health characteristics of the HANDLS region and the ways in which racial and socioeconomic data needs to be collected in order to assess its influence on a variety of health outcomes such as cardiovascular and cerebrovascular functioning, psychophysiological and cognitive performance, and muscular strength and conditioning. Nutritional status influences an individual's risk for the development of chronic conditions, thereby affecting a person's ability to live a healthy and productive life. This project attempts to define the criteria for determining the sample population's nutritional status and the effects of nutritional status over the course of the longitudinal study. The purpose of this project is to establish the planning documentation and epidemiological sample frame for conducting a longitudinal study that disentangles the confounding effects of race and socioeconomic status on long term healthy aging. The goal of this project will focus on creating survey-sampling methodologies and applications unique to a diverse and complex population, spanning numerous and various socioeconomic patterns, with a particular focus on assessment made by a longitudinal study, such as the development of criteria essential to assess nutritional status for segmenting a diverse population base. Nutritional monitoring methods to be used to develop this criterion include multiple dietary recalls, blood chemistries, functional status measures, food security measures, and anthropometrical measures.</p>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.
