<DESC>NA The Defense Contracting Command - Washington intends to issue to Ketron Managment Science, a sole source purchase order for the license renewal of Change Action Software.  This software was originally purchased as a proprietary systems level tracking and c ontrols software used to relieve the systems programming staff of the laborious task of manually recording changes by providing a tool to automatically track and record all changes, provide the change information online or from batch reports, and provide b ackup and recovery capabilities. The renewal license is for the period 01 October 2002 through 30 September 2003. This acquisition is being conducted under guidance of FAR Part 12 and subpart 6.302.1.  Only one responsible source and no other services will  satisfy the agency requirements.  No solicitation document exists and no responses are anticipated.  For additional information contact Timothy J. Perkins, Contract Specialist at 703-602-3735, Email timothy.perkins@hqda.army.mil.

<DESC>NA The HCCC shall provide Command, Control and Communications capability to support America’s force projection doctrine.  Force XXI and Army Transformation forces operations will involve rapid force projection from CONUS or forward deployed locations with as much as 90% of all materiel being transported by sea.  The Army requires the capability to perform Logistics-Over-The-Shore/Joint-Logistics-Over-The-Shore (LOTS/JLOTS) operations, intra-theater lift of forces, sustainment, and recovery and salvage of degra ded ports in an austere environment.  LOTS/JLOTS includes the discharge of strategic Sealift ships in stream, through shallow draft or limited capability ports, through fully operational ports or over unimproved beaches.  It also includes the forward displ acement of tactical forces and sustainment to bypass over-burdened and degraded transportation infrastructure, and the rehabilitation/recovery of ports destroyed or damaged through enemy action.  As with all elements in a military operation, effective comm and and control is necessary to efficiently track and manage all watercraft assets and port facilities in order to maximize throughput.  The controlling organization for LOTS/JLOTS or port operations is the Transportation Harbormaster Operations Detachment  (THOD).  Much the same way as air traffic controllers and ground controllers manage aircraft approaches, runways, taxiways, aircraft ramps and parking areas, the THOD is the only organization designed to manage vessel movements and waterfront activities f rom fixed ports to a multi-point LOTS/JLOTS area.   The HC3 System will provide the THOD with the capability to communicate between the Army, Navy, Air Force, USMC, Coast Guard, Coalition, civilian and host nation ships via HF, UHF, VHF (secure and non-secure voice and data), tactical and satellite modes. The THOD will also use the equipment within the HC3S to collect and disseminate meteorological and bathymetric data to sipping within the operational area, establish vessel traffic and separation schemes, materiel/ammunition berthing, anchoring, and coordi nate port services/vessel support.  The HCCC System will be used in commercial fixed ports or in Logistics-Over-The-Short (LOTS) operations where cargo is being off-loaded in stream from ships and ferried to the beach on smaller vessels.  The THOD has the mission to manage vessel movements and waterfront facilities much the same way as air traffic controllers and ground controllers manage aircraft approaches, runways and taxiways.  Each system has a Vehicle Based Mobile Platform (VBMP).  The mission of the VBMP is the same as for the ground-based unit.  The VBMP will provide the THOD unit with a means of moving to another location without having to move the ground-based unit. The Contractor would be required to deliver the HCCC System (HC3S) complete in every respect, even though only performance parameters and required features are specified in the Purchase Description (PD).  Each HC3S will consist of one (1) ground based unit  with two (2) external generator units and the capability of connection to shore power; one (1) ground based storage unit; two (2) Vehicle Based Mobile Platforms (VBMP) with an external generator unit each, and the capability of connection to shore power.  This information is for information purposes only: specifications and details are provided in the HCCCS Purchase Description (PD) which can be reviewed by linking through the website listed below. The following information is requested:  1) Identify the Company name, point of contact, address, telephone, and e-mail address (if available).    2) Has your company done work with the Government before?  If so, provide a listing of those programs with an explanation of what you provided.   3) If you have provided similar product(s) to the commercial, an explanation of what was provided and to whom it was provided is desired.  Were you the prime contractor?  Were you the subcontracto r?     4) Have you provided any telecommunications systems to commercial or Government agencies for Watercraft?   5) Are you a small business, large business, and/or do you have set-aside status of any kind?   6) Are you registered in the CCR?  If not are you willing to do so? The response to this request may be submitted in any form or format, including the company's standard literature. Price data is desirable.

<DESC>NA Recent operational experience has demonstrated that Army watercraft do not possess the capabilities to seamlessly integrate its logistical requirements.  This capability shortfall puts the burden on the vessel crew to manually log their inventory, requisit ion supplies, track completed maintenance actions, and record projected logistics requirements.  This paperwork detracts from the available maintenance crew time and contributes to overall performance delays.  Army watercraft must possess the capability to  automatically monitor and manage all mission critical on-board systems.  To that end the U.S. Army Tank Automotive and armaments Command, is seeking sources to identify a monitoring and management system for our developing Telelogistics Program.  This Pro gram requires a system that can provide integrated watercraft systems management, support of logistical functions such as inventory management and supply requisitions, tracking and prioritization of maintenance, machinery history, vessel modifications, and  fuel management.  It will need to include interface capability with Interactive Electronic Manuals (IETMs) to support interactive equipment troubleshooting, monitoring of on-board systems with an audible notification to enable condition based maintenance,  prognostic/diagnostic capabilities, and enhance situational awareness.  These technologies are to be integrated into a single on-board maintenance management system providing automation interface with the Standard Army Management Information Systems (STAM IS), and The Army Maintenance Management Systems (TAMMS) as pertains to Army watercraft, as a minimum.   Additionally, the system must show a balance of focus on both the current and future watercraft requirements.  It must consider complete vessel systems  integration to include voyage management, administrative/personnel functions and on-board communications systems.  All information systems (engineering, navigation, personnel, etc.) on-board Army watercraft will need to be fully integrated utilizing a Shi p Wide Area Network (SWAN).  This is required to enable seamless oversight, information sharing, information warehousing, and allow watercraft crews to effectively and efficiently monitor, maintain, troubleshoot, and sustain the Army fleet of LSV's (7 ea.) , LCU's (35 ea) and Large Tugs (6 ea.) in all environments, including joint ventures. The following information is requested:  1) Has your company done work with the Government before?  Please provide a listing of those programs with an explanation of what you provided.   2) Have you have provided similar product(s) to commercial businesses? What was provided and to whom?

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE:

The U.S. Customs Service intends to negoitiate and award as sole source to Toss Inc., 10201 Lee Highway, Suite 570, Fairfax, VA., 22033.  

The award will be based upon the procedures as described in FAR 6.3 Other Than Full and Open Competition.  The procedures of FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition awards over $25,000.00 but not more than $100,000.00.  The award will be processed under the authority of 10 USCS 23(1),only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements. 

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. 
However, all proposals received by the closing date and 5:00 PM central standard time will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Toss Inc is the only known source who can provide the U.S. Customs Service Logistics Division National Printing Officer software with the capability to manage, track, analyze, perform quality assurance, and in many instances project program productivity, workload, costs and potential revenue.  These tasks must be accomplished in concert with the existing federal printing system (including forms, procurement methods and award data furnished by the Government Printing Office).  This determination was made by the U.S. Customs Service Office of Information and Technology Lan Engineering Team and Technical Review Committee.  It was determined that the Production Tracker offered by Toss Inc., is the only printing management tool available on the market that is capable of providing the required service and is designed to work effectively inside a secure government information technology environment such as the U.S. Customs Service.
