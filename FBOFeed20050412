<CONTACT>Kimberly B. Luke Contract Specialist 7037871339     Kimberly.Luke@mms.gov;
<DESC>The Minerals Management Service's Leasing Division, and specifically, the Division's Marine Minerals Branch has been focusing on integrating geologic and environmental information, developed through partnerships with coastal States and contracted or cooperative study efforts, to identify suitable Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) sand deposits for beach and coastal restoration and to provide needed environmental information in regards to environmental management of these resources.  The MMS has jurisdiction over all mineral resources on the Federal Outer Continental Shelf.  Public Law 103-426, enacted October 31, 1994, gave the MMS the authority to convey, on a noncompetitive basis, the rights to OCS sand, gravel, or shell resources for shore protection, beach or wetlands restoration projects, or for use in construction projects funded in whole or part or authorized by the Federal Government.  Since enactment of PL 103-426, MMS has provided Federal sand for beach nourishment projects in New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, Florida, South Carolina, and Louisiana.  To date, most geological/geophysical investigations associated with the search for new offshore sand borrow areas located in federal waters has been the raised shoal features found along the coast. Recently, however, the continuing search for new sand borrow sites along the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf coasts has resulted in the identification of potential sand borrow areas in Federal waters which are not associated with these raised topographic features.  Significant quantities of sand suitable for beach nourishment have been found in surficial sand deposits or sand sheets, as well as buried paleochannels. In many instances, buried channel deposits are situated under a significant thickness of overlying sediment which must be side-cast or disposed of in some manner before dredging of the borrow material can be accomplished. A beach restoration effort at Holly Beach, Louisiana used an offshore buried channel deposit in which several feet of fine-grained material was removed and sidecast adjacent of the borrow site. A similar deposit is being considered for use for a project at Pelican Island, Louisiana. A sizable overburden of fine silt and clay must be removed from the Sandy Point borrow site before the clean sand can be accessed.  The overburden material will be sidecast into nearby identified disposal areas. Whether it be a shoal or non-shoal deposit, the process involved in the removal of seabed material and subsequent transport and placement of material on the beach or coastal area is called dredging.  Offshore sand dredging for beach nourishment projects employ hydraulic dredges almost exclusively and are normally either cutterhead or hopper-type dredges.  Regardless of the dredging method employed, however, the process may result in adverse effects on various components of the marine or coastal environment.  An Environmental Report prepared by Louis Berger and Associates for MMS (Louis Berger Group, Inc., 1999 - OCS Study MMS 99-0036) contains a complete description of the dredging process. The report is available on the MMS website at http://www.mms.gov/sandandgravel/PDF/environmentalreport1999.PDF. MMS has conducted numerous site-specific biological and physical studies on shoal features identified as possible borrow sites, but has not as yet examined the potential for adverse impacts associated with the dredging of buried channel deposits or sand sheet areas. Studies conducted offshore have clearly shown that benthic community structure is strongly correlated to sediment type. Since sediment type is likely to be different in buried channel or sheet sand deposits than in shoal deposits, it is likely that these types of deposits have very different resident biological communities and may be impacted quite differently during a typical dredging operation.  The side-casting or disposal of fine-grained slits, mud, or clays may also pose some adverse impacts. In addition to the biological considerations, the dredging of the deposits might leave a sizable depression in the seafloor which could result in adverse changes in the local wave climate and sediment transport regime.  These factors and the biological and physical impacts associated with the use of these deposits, including the potential effects of the side-casting of any overburden material, must be thoroughly investigated before negotiating leases for planned beach nourishment projects. Objective of the study: The purpose of this study is to examine, on a generic basis, the potential for adverse effects on the biology and physical characteristics of areas along the east and Gulf coasts of the United States should dredging proceed in potential borrow sites which are not associated with raised topographic features, such as surficial sheet sands and buried paleochannels. The prospective contractor will be asked to compile and synthesize existing oceanographic literature and data sets to develop an understanding of the baseline benthic ecological conditions and the physical oceanographic regime in and around potential sand borrow areas which are representative of typical sand sheet and buried channel deposits found along the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts.  The prospective offeror will design and carry out an investigative study effort to evaluate possible adverse biological and physical impacts associated with the dredging of sand sheet or buried channel deposits located in U. S. Federal waters. The prospective contractor shall prepare a technical report with clear, concise writing at a level suitable to a technical audience familiar with the various facets of the marine sciences.  Judicious use of tables, figures, and maps is encouraged.  The format and organization for the manuscript will be agreed upon between the Program Manager (PM) and the MMS-COTR prior to preparation. A draft final manuscript shall be submitted to MMS for review before preparation of the final document.  The prospective contractor shall prepare a Draft Technical Summary after completion and acceptance of the final manuscript, as well as a draft scientific paper describing the study, its purpose, methods, conclusions, etc. for submission to an appropriate technical journal, and will be required to present details of this study at a scheduled MMS Gulf of Mexico Information Transfer Meeting (ITM) or other technical conference as agreed upon between the PM and the MMS COTR. It is expected that the work effort will take a total of 24 months.  The cost of this effort is Not to Exceed $300,000.  Work products will include a Draft and Final Technical Report.  THIS IS A TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS SET ASIDE.  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 541620 "Environmental Consulting Services".  The size standard for this NAICS code is $6 Million. For a full copy of this request for proposal, please contact Kimberly Luke, Contract Specialist.

<DESC>This is an amendment to announcement 4091 posted on 3/31/2005.  The proposed contract to purchase Ameritec Responders for voice and data transmission line testing will be a small business set-aside. The proposed contract will have an estimated value of $253,000 for the purchase and delivery of one order.  This FAA purchase is expected to consist of approximately one-hundred twenty-five (125) Ameritec AM3-4P Stand alones, two-hundred sixty-three (263) Ameritec AM3-4P-PC Cards, seventeen (17) Ameritec Card Files, and seventeen (17) Ameritec Power Supplies.   The Ameritec Model AM3 Series Responders provide the capability to centrally test voice and data telecommunications lines without dispatching a technician to the remote end of a circuit, see specifications attached. The AM3 reacts to commands, sent by Dual Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) digits from a central location, by sending over the circuit under test a known signal or sequence of test tones or by quiet termination of the circuit. The FAA must purchase AM3 Responders for the following reasons:  1.	AM3 has been used for 15 years across the U.S. and due to the need for compatibility of new and replacement parts the FAA must use Ameritec responders; 2.	The responders are needed immediately. If any small business feels they can provide Ameritec Responders of the type and quantities described above and in the specifications please contact Dixie Harper at dixie.harper@faa.gov, no later than 2:00 PM Tuesday April 19, 2005.

<DESC>Precision navigation and timekeeping are essential for many modern naval and maritime systems, and it is essential that navigation and timekeeping services be made available to platforms and weapons at the highest level of accuracy and with the highest possible confidence at reasonable cost. Lack of precise navigation and timekeeping technologies may jeopardize the success of military operations. For example, the Global Positioning System (GPS) provides highly accurate position/time information at low cost and, due to this, GPS has become the technology of choice for many users. Unfortunately, the GPS signal is a low-power signal that is susceptible to conventional interference and emerging jammers. Therefore there is a need for both (1) affordable approaches to make GPS more reliable/robust against interference and jamming, and (2) affordable reliable precision navigation/timing alternatives to GPS. ONR has been conducting a series of Science and Technology Projects in (1) GPS Anti-jam Technology, (2) Tightly Coupled GPS/Inertial Navigation System (INS) devices, (3) Atomic Clock Development and (4) Non-GPS Navigation Devices.

<DESC>Request for Quote

Research to Improve the Empirical Foundations for Capital Services Measures - 
This is a solicitation for commercial items.  The announcement constitutes the solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is being issued as a request for quotation. (RFQ)
	
I.  Background   

The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) requires additional empirical evidence to improve the measures of capital used in measuring “multifactor productivity” (MFP).  BLS is seeking to fund one or more proposals for research projects that would identify and exploit new data sources to improve the assumptions made in the measurement process.  The projects will be presented as research papers, presented by the contractor at seminars in Washington, DC, during September, 2006.             

Improvements in the design of new capital goods, and the sheer accumulation of capital goods, can raise productivity.  To understand economic growth it is important to have good measures of capital.  BLS measures MFP using a neoclassical productivity model, in the tradition of work by Solow, Jorgenson, and many others.   As with any economic measure, many assumptions must be made in capital measurement.  However, the role of capital in production is particularly complex.  There is uncertainty, at the time assets are produced, about the pattern of returns they will provide in the future.  For most types of assets, rigid assumptions are typically made about the patterns of services and returns to assets.  These assumptions are often based on a few parameters derived from evidence that is either out of date or that relates to other types of assets.

II.  Scope of research projects that will be considered.

There are a number of specific areas where BLS requires better information:

-	Service lives, i.e., the length of the period that assets spend in the service of businesses or households.
-	Patterns of utilization of assets during their lifetimes, e.g., data on the intensity with which they are used, such as number of hours they are in service and the amount of output they generate.  There are issues of how these variables behave during the business cycle as well as with the age of the asset.   
-	The behavior of asset rental prices (revenues less cost associated with particular assets) with age and/or over the business cycle.   
-	The behavior of asset purchase prices.
-	Changes in the characteristics or “quality” of new capital goods.  Little effort has been made to base quality adjustments on rental prices, the basis suggested in capital theory, instead of on asset prices.
-	The factors that influence service lives, utilization, and depreciation, such as physical decay (which may cause down-time or increased maintenance cost), obsolescence, the business cycle, or the growth rate of the industry employing the assets.  
-	Land values.  Present land value measures rest on heroic assumptions.  Evidence on the value of land relative to the value of structures would be useful.  Time series data that differentiated by industry or otherwise by type of land-use would be most useful.  (Data might be based on hedonic studies conducted by the authors.  Alternatively, good estimates may be available from tax assessment databases, provided the assessments are based on sophisticated methods.)  
-	Inventory depreciation or other price changes.
-	Assets that are used in specific industries as well as assets that are found throughout the economy. 

Although the primary focus will be on new data sources for tangible business assets, other topics that improve the empirical basis for capital measurement would be of interest.  For example, new evidence on the role of intangible capital, human capital, or consumer durables would be of interest, as would be studies that use micro data to help identify how company-based capital data might be used in developing capital time series for establishment-based industry productivity studies.

The use of data sources that have not been used previously in capital measurement work is paramount.  The data may be obtained from private sources or they may be tabulated from public notices, such as advertised prices.  The selection and use of advanced econometric techniques will be important to extracting information on relationships and parameters that are useful to the BLS capital and multifactor productivity measures.  If there are issues relating to protecting the confidentiality of the data provider, the contractor must raise these issues in the proposal so that the BLS and the contractor can evaluate potential legal issues and potential limitations to the study before the contract is awarded.     

III.  Work Plan

The proposal shall specify the types of assets, industries, and/or types of issues (see Section II for the scope of issues) that will be examined.  The proposal shall also describe which data source(s) will be developed and how it will be used.  A successful proposal shall describe a project that would significantly benefit the goals of improving the BLS MFP measures and that would represent a significant and novel contribution to the literature on the subject of capital measurement.  The proposal shall include the curriculum vita of the principal investigator.

Each contractor shall obtain the data, analyze the data, and write up the results in a format suitable for sharing with academic peers.  It is the sole responsibility of the contractor to obtain the data for the proposed project.  An interim report shall be submitted to BLS no later than April 30, 2006.  This report shall present tabulations demonstrating that the contractor has the data and has control of the data in an analytic software package and it shall clarify the directions of the remainder of the project.  After receiving this report, BLS will provide feedback on the most useful directions for the analysis.  A research paper shall be submitted to the BLS no later than August 31, 2006 so that BLS officials have an opportunity to read it before the seminar is presented during September.  At the seminar, the contractor shall present the findings of the research orally and shall answer questions posed by BLS staff and by members of the research community invited to the seminar by BLS.  The BLS, at its discretion, may ask for additional analysis or revisions to the paper.  These revisions may be to address any of several possible issues, such as improving the usefulness of the results to the BLS, addressing econometric issues raised at the seminar, or acknowledging editorial comments.  The revised paper, along with an executive summary of approximately two pages, will constitute the final report.  This will be due no later than September 30, 2006 or one year from date of award, whichever comes first.. 

IV.  Period of Performance

The contract period shall be one year from the date of award.  The projected date of the award is September, 2005.  

V.  Deliverables

The following deliverables shall be completed within the timeframe stated below:

Deliverables:                                                                Delivery Dates:

Interim report                                                         April 30, 2006

Research paper                                                       August 31, 2006

Presentation at Seminar                                          September 15, 2006

Final report                                                             September 30, 2006  


VI.  Funding

BLS will making one or more awards not to exceed $100,000, depending on available funds, the costs of the proposals, and the quality of the proposals as determined using the selection criteria, below.  The contractor shall submit a cost breakdown for all costs, such as travel, costs for data, etc. 


VII.  Selection Criteria

Proposals shall be evaluated in accordance with the following criteria:

1)  The relevance of the data source to U.S. business sector capital.  The Bureau will consider questions such as: How significant are the assets being evaluated?  How representative are the observations available from the data source of the general population of assets?  How many variables are there upon which to gauge the physical use and value of assets as they age?  Are there panel qualities to the data as well as cross section?  What is the quality of the data to be used in the study?  (20 points)

2)  The quality of the analytic framework.  For example: Are the econometric tests or statistics that are proposed appropriate?  Will the study likely be viewed as a contribution to the literature on economic measurement?  Will the study be likely to identify variables in a way that will be useful in estimating U.S. business sector capital.   (20 points)

3)  The number of issues are addressed by the full set of proposals.  The Bureau prefers that each study encompass a different topic.  If multiple proposals are on very similar topics then the best one will be given preference and the others will be less likely to be selected relative to proposals on different topics. (10 points)

4)  The feasibility of the plan of study described in the proposal.  The Bureau will judge whether the proposal describes an area of study that can be completed in the time frame allowed and with the funds available.      (10 points)

5)  Experience of the contractor.  The Bureau will review the contractor’s past publications of studies using econometric tools to do empirical analysis.  (20 points)

6)	Cost of project.  The cost of the project will be assessed relative to the scope and difficulty of the proposed project.  A less difficult project may be funded if it is of value and if its cost is in line with its difficulty.  (20 points)

<DESC>This request is being solicited on an unrestricted base.  This is an Architect-Engineer (A-E) service acquisition for a firm-fixed price indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract for a base period of one year and two option periods of one year each.  The NAICS Code is 541330.  A-E services are required for the preparation of estimating and programming, development of plans, specifications and cost estimates suitable for bidding and repairs, renovations, alterations, upgrades, possible replacement (new construction), and associated demolition work for various projects at Dare County Bomb Range, Fort Fisher and Seymour Johnson AFB in NC.  A-E services for these projects will be accomplished under Task Orders written against the IDIQ contract.  Construction cost ranges for these projects vary; however, it is not contemplated that the cost range for any individual job will exceed $10,000,000.  The selected A-E firm(s) will be required to participate in an orientation, scope of work and site visit meetings (when requested) within 7 calendar days after receiving the request for proposal for a project.  The fees under the IDIQ contract will not exceed $750,000 for any base or option period with the maximum task order amount of $299,000.  The guaranteed minimum for the IDIQ contract is $10,000.  The work involved is multi-disciplined and includes, but is not limited to architectural, structural, civil, environmental, electrical, fire protection and mechanical requirements.  Field surveying, landscaping design, and architectural rendering capabilities may be required.  Familiarity with English and metric system of measurements is required.  Disciplines and capabilities may be represented within the same firm or with consultants that regularly work with the primary firm.  The firm(s) must provide part-time and/or full-time on-site project specific construction inspection, contract administration and field engineering services.  The firms(s) must provide full and/or part-time on-site design and plan review by professional engineers and/or architects on an as-needed basis.  All drawings must be formatted in AUTOCAD Release 2000 or higher.  Documentation shall be furnished with each drawing file detailing level layer usage, and scale information for drawings.  Each final drawing shall be provided on CD-ROM, formatted for the Windows operating system.  The firm(s) shall also be able to obtain MaxView/SourceView software and convert drawing files formatted for electronic posting over the Internet.  Each converted drawing file shall be provided on CD-ROM, formatted for the Windows operating system.  Firms are reminded of the requirement in FAR 36.601-3(a), which states that the construction design specifications shall require the maximum practicable use of recovered materials considering the performance requirements, availability, price reasonableness, and cost-effectiveness.  The possibility of hazardous materials, i.e., asbestos, lead paint, and other materials may exist at project sites.  All hazardous materials licenses and/or accreditations necessary for the locality of the project site are required by the A-E firm(s) or their  sub-contractors.  The general intention is to provide for such design and engineering services as necessary to support the procurement of construction requirements/ acquisitions.  For the Government to retain maximum flexibility in the interest of their clients, various services/products, such as technical reports, studies, site investigations, concept designs, cost estimates, surveys, shop drawings reviews, construction consultation and inspection, Title II, preparation of construction record drawings, and O&M manuals, may be required at any time up to final acceptance of all work.  Because the IDIQ contract could eventually result in an award over $500,000, a subcontracting plan will be required by large business concerns.  All contractors are required to be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to receiving a contract award.    
B.  SELECTION CRITERIA:  Selection criteria to be utilized are listed in the relative order of importance as follows:  1.  Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required, including experience in energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction and the use of recovered materials; 2.

Professional capacity to complete projects within the established time limits, meeting project dollar thresholds, and current work load; 4.  Ability to provide part-time and/or full-time on-site project specific construction inspection, contract administration and field engineering.  Ability to provide full and/or part-time on-site design and plan review by professional engineers and/or architects on an as-needed basis.  5.

Competitive formal source selection procedures will be used in accordance with FAR 15.3.  The contract will be Firm Fixed Price.  The "Best Value Continuum, Tradeoff Process" is the method that will be used to evaluate price and other factors specified in the solicitation, with the goal being to select the proposal that offers the best value to the Government in terms of performance, quality and pricing.  The objective is to select the proposal that offers the most for the money, without necessarily basing selection on the lowest price.  The Technical Evaluation Factors are:  1.  EXPERIENCE . (1) The offeror must demonstrate its past organizational experience as a General Construction (GC) Contractor responsible for the construction of at least two (2) office projects, within the past ten (10) years, which is comparable in nature, type, and complexity to the project in this solicitation, and meets all the following characteristics: (a) New construction was for an office building including site, structural, electrical, mechanical, plumbing, interiors and fire protection systems;  (b) The project met one (1) of the following criteria: (i) The building size was not less than 250,000 gross square feet, or (ii) The construction cost at award of the construction contract was not less that $50 million for the complete core and shell.

Considerations include: (1) Educational background; (2) Experience on similar projects in a position comparable to that for which they are being proposed; (3) Certification or professional registration held by the individuals proposed for key personnel positions.  4.

This solicitation is not set-aside for small business, however this procurement is being made under the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program. The General Services Administration (GSA) is committed to assuring that maximum practicable opportunity is provided to small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns to participate in the performance of this contract consistent with its efficient performance. GSA expects any subcontracting plan submitted pursuant to FAR 52.219-9, Small, Small Disadvantaged, and Women Owned Small Business Subcontracting Plan, to reflect this commitment. Consequently, an offeror, other than a small business concern, before being awarded a contract exceeding $500,000 ($1,000,000 for construction) will be required to demonstrate that its subcontracting plan represents a creative and innovative program for involving small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns as subcontractors in the performance of this contract.     If selected for award, the offeror’s subcontracting plan should be ready for approval without the need to obtain additional information.

The requirements of FAR 52.219-9 must be followed explicitly. 6.  APPRENTICESHIP PLAN.  The Government will evaluate the means by which the contractor shall promote the growth of skilled craft labor, specifically the contractor's use of a registered apprenticeship program.  (As used herein, the term "registered apprenticeship program" is a program that is registered with the United States Department of Labor or State Apprenticeship Council.).   The General Services Administration will only make this RFP available electronically at www.eps.gov.     GSA intends to upload the RFP at this site on or about April 28, 2005.

<DESC>The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center (FISC) Norfolk, Contracting Department, Philadelphia Division, intends to procure clerical and administrative support services as described in this synopsis.  The Department of Defense (DoD) has implemented a DoD-Wide Strategic Sourcing (DWSS) program to provide customers throughout the Department with services and products acquired in the most efficient and advantageous manner.  The overall goals of the DWSS program are:  Department-wide cross-functional acquisition strategies; Reduction in Total Cost of Ownership for acquired services/products; Improvements in meeting socio-economic goals through the use of strategic sourcing; and Streamlining and standardization of acquisition business processes.  As part of this program the Department intends to purchase clerical and administrative support functions (collectively referred to as clerical support services) at the DoD-Wide level.   The government intends to work collaboratively with the suppliers selected in order to reduce total costs and attain the goals of the DWSS program.  DoD is particularly interested in identifying and implementing process improvements or requirements changes that will enable the selected suppliers to achieve reductions in markup rates (reflecting the difference between direct labor and total costs), in order to reduce costs while maintaining or increasing quality.  Under this initial solicitation, the type of work to be procured will typically be general office work auxiliary to the work of the requiring organization.  The anticipated labor categories utilized on this contract will generally match the Department of Labor Wage Determination categories under the “Administrative Support and Clerical Occupations” section.  During contract performance, the Government anticipates holding a series of Supplier Collaboration Workshops.  While contractor attendance at the workshops will not be a contract requirement, all selected contractors will be encouraged to attend and participate.  The primary goal of the workshops is to lower total costs related to clerical support services while improving quality.  No additional payments will be made for contractor participation in the workshops.  The contractor shall provide and maintain a Quality Control Plan consistent with commercial standards that shall assure the performance requirements of the contract are provided as specified.  The Quality Control Plan shall include an inspection system.  The plan shall address methods for identifying and preventing defects in the quality of service performed before the level of performance becomes unsatisfactory.  This initial solicitation is anticipated to result in multiple award indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts pursuant to FAR 16.5.  These contracts will provide clerical support services required by DoD in three geographic regions: Washington, DC, Norfolk, VA, and Philadelphia, PA.  The maximum quantity of services under all awarded contracts for all three regions is anticipated not to exceed 825,000 manhours for the first year.  The basic performance period under the resultant contracts will begin 1 Oct 2005.  An option period will be included.  The option period will be exercised only under those contracts where the contractor has met a certain set of criteria during the base performance period.  The solicitation will describe the option exercise process.  Although this will be a DoD-Wide program, specific task orders under the contracts will be initiated, awarded, and managed directly by the Service/Agency/Activity having the requirement.  It is anticipated that task orders will be placed electronically.  This solicitation will be set-aside 100% for small businesses.  In addition, the Government has a goal of awarding two or more IDIQ contracts to certified 8(a) firms to provide coverage in each of the three regions.  The Government intends to award multiple IDIQ type contracts to the eligible, responsible offerors whose offers represent the best value, considering price and technical factors.  The specific evaluation criteria will be outlined in the solicitation.  When available, the solicitation will be posted at the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) Web site, www.neco.navy.mil.  The solicitation will indicate a closing date.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 561110, and the applicable size standard is $6 million.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to issue a contract to assemble, test, and deliver 281 Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Next Generation Underwater Breathing Apparatus (NUBA).     These Next-Generation Underwater Breathing Apparatus (NUBA)s are being acquired to complete baseline evaluation at the Navy Experimental Diving Unit (NEDU) and for delivery to the fleet.   The Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Group identifies the need for EOD forces to destroy and/or neutralize underwater mines.  The Mk 16 is currently fulfilling this need, but is doing so at a high cost to the Government and with increasingly reduced reliability.   The current system is an aged design that has not benefited from modern manufacturing techniques to reduce part counts and increase reliability.  There is a need for a UBA that is more cost effective and reliable than the MK 16.   Competition will be limited to the Divex Stealth EOD-M manufactured by Divex, Aberdee! n, United Kingdom and the Viper E Underwater Breathing Apparatus (UBA) and the MK 16 MOD 2 UBA both manufactured by Carleton Technologies (CT), Mississauga, Ontario.  Competition will be limited for the following reasons.  An Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) was conducted by the Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC) to identify systems constraints, identify all potentially suitable alternatives, coordinate with the Requirements Working Group (RWG) to define and prioritize the system requirements, assess each alternative, and rank each alternative using the prioritized list of system requirements to determine their overall performance scores.  A market survey was conducted using characteristics generated by the RWG.  Those characteristics were used to solicit information from industry for NUBAs.  Based on the information received from industry, the RWG recommends further evaluation of three alternative NUBAs listed above.  These NUBAs offer the greatest state of th! e art in electronically controlled systems and more modern design and manufacturing that allow for fewer parts and easier maintenance.  The NUBAs will be delivered FOB destination to Naval Support Activity Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL, 32407-7018.  NAICS Code 541990 applies.  SBA size standard is 500 employees.  FSC is 7035.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center - Panama City, 110 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, Florida intends to solicit Burnham Polymeric, Inc., 10036 Saratoga Road, South Glen Falls, NY 12803 on a sole source basis for the furnishing of 40 kilometers of upgraded 0.955" ruggedized Fiber Optic Marine Cable (FOMC). The government will supply the bare optical fiber and Burnham Polymeric will apply the special high strength coating using their proprietary process. The government does not possess the data necessary to compete this process. Additionally, the government has spent many years attempting to find/establish a process that would yield a FOMC that would withstand the environmental stresses (marine biological attacks (by crustaceans)) imparted in the intended application. Only Burnham Polymeric has been able to develop a process that produces a FOMC that meets all size, concentricity, and performance requirements (maximum attenuation per meter of the coated cable shall be 0.25dB ! per kilometer at the 1550 nm wavelength, 0.5 dB per kilometer at 1300 nm, and withstand 30 lb. working tensile load with no attenuation degradation), and withstands attack by crustaceans. Delivery will be the Naval Support Activity - Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018. NAICS Code 335921 applies.

<DESC>This procurement is for one solicitation resulting in the award of up to six Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Construction Contracts to the responsible proposers whose proposal,  conforming to the RFP will be most advantageous to the Government resulting in the best value, cost or price and other factors considered.  The Government reserves the right to award fewer than six contracts if sufficient number of acceptable proposals are not submitted to make awards.  The Government may consider volume of work under these contracts when requesting bids for new projects in order to affect an equitable distribution of work.  The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all proposers; to award the contract to other than the proposer submitting the lowest total price and to award to the proposer submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous to the Government.  PROPOSERS ARE ADVISED THAT AN AWARD MAY BE MADE WITHOUT EXCHANGES OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED.  The work will consist of demolition, repair, and replacement of roofing systems and associated related work at MCAS Cherry Point, outlying fields, and MCB Camp LeJeune and MCAS New River, North Carolina.  The work will include demolition, repair, and replacement of roofing systems (including but not limited to modified bitumen, standing seam metal, shingles, single ply systems) and incidental related work including, but not limited to, painting, asbestos/lead paint abatement, architectural modifications (i.e decking replacement, blocking, etc.) and structural modifications.  Projects assigned to the IDIQ contracts will use the Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) approach to scope and price the work.  After award of the initial contract(s), up to six contractors, will compete for task orders based on best value, low price or low price technically acceptable to the Government.  Each contract will be for one base year with four one-year options.  The total 5-year (base year and four option years) not-to-exceed amount for each contract is $30,000,000.00.  Each contract has an annual value not to exceed $6,000,000.00.  Construction schedules will be determined for each project at the issuance of each task order.  The six best value contractors will be selected for the award of either the seed project or the award of one of the six contracts with a minimum guarantee of $10,000.00 to each successful offeror over the full term of the contract to include the option years.  The first IDIQ construction contract of the six will be awarded with a firm-fixed price, 100% design as the seed project.  This is a RFP, which requires submission of technical and price proposals.  Evaluation of award will be based on technical factors including (A) Past Performance, (B) Management and Organization, and (C) Support for Small, Small Disadvantaged, and Women-Owned Businesses.  Management and Organization has sub-factors which are:  (1) Corporate Experience, (2) Quality Control and Key Personnel, (3) Safety and Health, and (4) Bonding Capability for projects of size and nature envisioned.  Support for Small, Small Disadvantaged, and Women-Owned Businesses has sub-factors (1) Small Business Past Performance, and (2) Subcontracting Plan Effort.  It will also be based on pricing full plans and specifications for the seed project, N62470-05-D-7106, Replace Roof, Building 902, Marine Corps Base, Camp LeJeune, North Carolina, which has an estimated cost range of $250,000.00 to $500,000.00.   The best value contractor of the six IDIQ contracts will be awarded the seed project with the initial award.  All six contracts will compete on subsequent task orders.  These subsequent projects will be non-complex performance oriented tasks requiring minimal design.  Award factors will vary depending on the unique requirements for each task order, however, pricing will be weighted heavily.  The awarded task order will be a firm-fixed price task with a specific completion date.  Should the second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth IDIQ contractor be unable to competitively secure a task order to meet the minimum guarantee, award considerations may be modified in order to ensure each participating contractor is awarded task orders meeting the minimum guarantee.  All initial awarded contractors will be required to participate in all MACC walk-throughs, if required, and submit proposals.  Failure to participate in walk-throughs and failure to submit proposals on task orders may result in the Government not issuing additional task orders or exercising the option to extend the contract for an additional year.  The contract will be awarded to the best value offeror in accordance with the requirements of FAR Park 15.  Only the six selected contractors will be permitted propose on the task orders.  Proposals from another contractor will not be accepted.  A minimum of two proposals will satisfy the competitive requirements of MACC and preclude the necessity of soliciting for a replacement contractor if for any reason one of the contracts is terminated or one of the proposers is not able to participate in the process.  Failure to participate in the task order process may result in forfeiture of the minimum guarantee amount.  Seed project is unrestricted with a NAICS of 238160 and size standard of $12,000,000.  No public bid opening will be held.  A subcontracting plan is required, if the contract is awarded to a large business.  Plans and specifications will be available on or about 29 April 2005.  The estimated date for receipt of offers is on or about 27 May 2005.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch (OEEB), plans to procure on a sole source basis with China National Environmental Monitoring Center,
1 Yuhuinan Road Chaoyang Dist., Beijing, China 100029, for services in accordance with the simplified acquisitions procedures authorized in FAR Part 13.  Project Title:   A Hospital-Based Case-Control Study of Non-Smoking Women in Xuan Wei and Fu Yuan, China: Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH) Exposure, Genetic Susceptibility, and Lung Cancer.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541990 and the business size standard is $6M.  Females in Xuan Wei County have the highest lung cancer mortality rate in China (eight times the Chinese national average) even though few of them are smokers. Thus this region constitutes a unique natural experiment that is one of the best opportunities in the world to carry out a model study of gene-environment interactions in lung cancer. Several lines of research have provided strong support that the excess lung cancer in this region is driven primarily by PAHs derived from smoky coal exposure. Results from a previous pilot molecular epidemiology study carried out in 1995-96 have provided evidence that genetic susceptibility is likely to play an important role in the etiology of lung cancer in this population. To investigate the gene-environment interaction in this population, the NCI will to initiate a hospital-based case-control study in the 4 largest hospitals in Qujing District. The NCI will identify and recruit 300 female lung cancer cases and 300 frequency-matched controls.  A buccal cell sample, a five (5) day sputum sample, a urine sample, and a 15ml venous blood sample will be collected from both cases and controls.  China National Environmental Monitoring Center of the Chinese Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) is the only governmental administration in China that is authorized to collect environmental surveillance information and assess environmental quality nationwide. The center has high-qualified scientists and specialists and more than 20-year experience in conducting environmental health research. Period of Performance:  September 1, 2005 – August 31, 2006. This is not a request for competitive quotation. China National Environmental Monitors Center is the only known source to the NCI.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  One original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 pm EST on April 27, 2005.   All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to 301-402-4513 or sent via email to holdcram@exchange.nih.gov.  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call 301-402-4509 or email Malinda Holdcraft at the above email address to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.

PROJECT TITLE: "Development of Molecularly Imprinted Polymer Based Solid Phase Extraction Materials for Determination of Pyrethroid Pesticides in Composite Dietary Samples.  BACKGROUND: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA) National Exposure Research Laboratory  (NERL) conducts  multimedia/multi-pathway (aggregate) exposure studies and assessments for the purpose of determining an individual's exposure to various environmental contaminants.  Within NERL, the Microbiological and Chemical Exposure Assessment Research Division's (MCEARD) dietary exposure  research program is designed to complement the NERL aggregate and cumulative exposure program.  The overall objective of the MCEARD dietary exposure research program is to support NERL's human exposure measurement and modeling efforts by reducing the amount of uncertainty in the dietary  measurements, thereby improving NERL's ability to evaluate dietary exposure relative to other pathways.  This information is critically needed for improved risk assessment.  Specifically, an analytical method development component of this research provides the tools needed to analyze composite food  and beverage samples for the presence of various classes of pesticides. NERL exposure monitoring programs require a capability to determine a broad range of target analytes in dietary samples.  The target analytes are identified by NERL study design teams to support programmatic and research  needs.  Usually, for economic reasons, dietary sampling results in a food composite representative of all foods consumed during a monitoring period (typically 24 hours).  Solid foods and beverages are usually collected separately.  Also for economic reasons, the number of analytes determined in a  single analysis is maximized.  Currently, MCEARD is developing methods for the determination of pyrethroid pesticides in composite dietary samples in support of planned children's exposure monitoring studies. In order to generate meaningful dietary exposure data, detection limits in the sub part  per billion (sub-ppb) range are needed.  Existing methods typically have detection limits for pyrethroid pesticides ranging from 5 - 50 ppb.  Strategies for improving detection limits include extracting larger samples and injecting larger volumes of the cleaned-up extract.  Both of these strategies  will require improved clean-up procedures that are more selective for the analytes of interest and will reduce the amount of co-extracted materials that foul instrument injection ports and columns and otherwise interfere with analysis. Molecular recognition based separation systems have received  attention in various fields due to their high selectivity for target molecules.  Molecular imprinting has been recognized as a promising technique for the development of such separation systems.  In fact, molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) have been developed for a number of analytes including  the pesticides atrazine and monosulfuron.  Previous work in NERL has targeted development of MIPs for pyrethroid pesticides.  Surface imprinted polymers were successfully developed for use in conjunction with transduction detection methods.  However, this work did not involve the production of  solid phase extraction materials as required under this statement of work. MCEARD is interested in developing a class specific molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) based solid phase extraction sorbent to be used in preparing extracts from composite dietary samples for subsequent analysis for  pyrethroid pesticides by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) or liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) using larger samples and/or injecting larger volumes.  It is anticipated that methods developed using this technology will be used in support of future NERL exposure measurement  studies. OBJECTIVE:  The contractor shall develop MIPs with selective binding to pyrethroid pesticides.  A class selective approach shall be taken for the determination of the following pyrethroid pesticides, grouped by priority since it may not be possible to include all of these compounds:  Highest Priority - cyfluthrin, cypermethrin, cis-permethrin, and trans-permethrin; Lower Priority -  allethrin, bifenthrin, deltamethrin, esfenvalerate, fenvalerate, lambda cyhalothrin, natural pyrethrins, prallethrin, resmethrin, sumithrin, tetramethrin, and tralomethrin.  SCOPE OF WORK: The  contractor shall perform the following tasks:  TASK  1: Contractor shall submit a Category 4 Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP).  See QAPP attachment for details and guidance on how to prepare a category 4 QAPP which is listed with this solicitation.   The QAPP must be approved by EPA prior to  commencement of laboratory work.  TASK 2: Contractor shall obtain structural information on pyrethroids of interest (allethrin, bifenthrin, cyfluthrin, cypermethrin, deltamethrin, esfenvalerate, fenvalerate, lambda cyhalothrin, cis-permethrin, trans-permethrin, natural pyrethrins, prallethrin,  resmethrin, sumithrin, tetramethrin and tralomethrin).  This structural information shall be used in selecting an appropriate template to be used in producing the MIP.  TASK 3: Contractor shall produce the MIP. TASK 4: Contractor shall evaluate binding properties, selectivity and solvent tolerance  of the MIP.  Food extracts are usually extracted with methylene chloride or hexane/acetone (1/1, v/v). TASK 5: Contractor shall prepare solid phase extraction (SPE) cartridges containing the MIP.  Typically, 5-10g samples of composite diets are extracted.  It is desired that the SPE cartridge have  the capacity to bind pyrethroids ranging in concentration from 0.1 ppb to 10 ppb in the food.  Consequently, the SPE cartridge must contain sufficient MIP to bind 1 - 100 ng of each pyrethroid analyte. TASK 6: Contractor shall optimize elution conditions for the MIP.  Elution shall avoid solvents  which are suspected carcinogens, such as chloroform and benzene.  TASK 7: Contractor shall evaluate performance of the MIP SPE cartridge in binding pyrethroid pesticides in extracts of composite diet matrices ranging in fat content from 1 -10% by weight.  The EPA Project Officer will provide  suitable composite diet matrices or recipes to prepare suitable composite diet matrices.  Contractor shall analyze food extracts cleaned up with the MIP SPE cartridges for pyrethroid pesticides using either gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, gas chromatography with electron capture detection or  other technique mutually agreed upon by the contractor and EPA Project Officer.  TASK 8:  Contractor shall evaluate recovery of pyrethroid analytes from the MIP.  Recoveries in the range of 70 - 130% are considered acceptable.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent that the United States Coast Guard, Maintenance and Logistics Command, Atlantic intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302 for a sole source contract with Fairbanks Morse Engine Division to Proto-Type Overhaul / Modify One (1) Fairbanks Morse 3800D8 1/8 Model 38D8 1/8 Diesel Engine.  The U.S. Coast Guard issued a sources sought synopsis (Reference number-21058053FA920, Posted January 14, 2005, Response Date January 24, 2005), no responses were received.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement within 10 calendar days of this notice.  The approximate issue date for the solicitation will be February 14, 2005.  The prototype engine overhaul / modification will be to a single diesel engine on the USCGC KATMAI BAY, a 140’ WTGB Icebreaking Tugboat located at Sault St. Marie, MI.  Overhaul /Modification will be done at the vessel’s homepier in Sault St. Marie, MI.  Vessel's availability schedule is for twenty-five (25) calendar days starting April 25, 2004.  The following services being requested to Overhaul and Modify the Fairbanks Morse Engine are:  (1) Evaluate the existing diesel engine’s salient features, to include the operating conditions, conditions of the existing machinery, review of the available service records of the engine, and the application of OEM and after-market components.  (2) Install exchange or rebuilt fuel injection pumps to produce a change to the existing injection timing of the engine to achieve higher exhaust temps at lower engine loads.  (3) Install an external motor-driven vacuum fan to ensure that the engine remains under proper vacuum irrespective of engine speed.  (4) Install an air-operated, PLC controlled, temperature control valve in the engine’s jacket water system.  The valve will be configured to regulate jacket water temperature based on existing lube oil temperature.  (5) Install a PLC control panel to control the above mentioned control valve as well as the existing air by-pass actuator for the installed blower.  (6)  Install a crankshaft air seal to reduce lost crankcase vacuum.  (7) Calibrate the existing Lube Oil Sump bayonet gage to ensure it complies with engine OEM Service Bulletin, Volume “A”, Issue 12, dated June 22, 1987.  (8) Perform an inspection of the engine’s existing vertical drive shaft assembly and provide a report on the condition of the components relative to the OEM tech manual.  (9) Perform an inspection of the engine’s existing roots blower and provide a report on the condition of the components relative to the EOM tech manual.  The inspection shall include the conduct of an air test.  (10) Perform an inspection of the engine’s existing gear train at the free end of the engine and provide a report on the condition of the components relative to the OEM tech manual.  This upgrade/overhaul is a prototype modification that will address documented concerns associated with light load operation, while maintaining optimum high icebreaking steady state and transient performance.  The light load concerns include excessive oil injection into the exhaust manifolds and piping.  Excessive exhaust oil injection also leads to the cutter’s topside surfaces getting coated with a slippery film of oil.  The oil injection is also an environmental concern, whether carried directly into the sea, or into the bilge.  The second primary low load concern is high smoke opacity.  The prototype installation goals are intended to demonstrate a Fairbanks Morse Engines proprietary modification approach that will successfully address the low load concerns, while maintaining optimum icebreaking steady state and transient load performance.  The engine is a unique opposed piston design.  One of the environmental concerns associated with the 140’ WTGB MSA main engine design decision is whether a modified Fairbanks Morse 8-38D8-1/8 engine will have to meet Environmental Protection Agency Tier 2 exhaust emission requirements.  The only known source to the Government for the services listed above is Fairbanks Morse Engine, Beloit, WI.  There may be vendors that can repair and tune the FBM diesel, but as a result of these unique design characteristics, it is believed that only the OEM, Fairbanks Morse Engine Division, possesses the design criteria, historical expertise, and technical ability to develop a new load-carrying profile for this engine.  The desired outcome of the engine modification should allow the vessel to operate safely and environmentally compliant at lower vessel speeds associated with new DHS Law Enforcement duties.  All reference documents are available for viewing at 300 East Main Street, Suite 600, Norfolk, VA  23510-9102.  There are no drawings applicable to this requirement.  For information concerning the acquisition, contact the Contracting Official listed.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), has a sole source requirement for breeding services involving genetically modified mice (knockin, knockout, and lentiviral).  This requirement will be a modification to existing IDIQ contract N01-AO-40013 with Ozgene Pty Ltd. of Bentley Australia.  Contractor will be required to provide breeding services which may include one or more of the following: removal of Cre, mating to homozygous, maintenance of reserve breeder colony, cryopreservation, line maintenance, and other specific breeding.  Ozgene has been identified as the only responsible source for two reasons.  First, the mice required for the breeding will be produced at Ozgene’s facility and transferring them to another contractor will add shipping and rederivation costs and prolong project completion time.  Second, breeding data will be tracked in the same database that already contains information for production of the mice as required under the current contract.  Services will be added for the current contract year and the remaining three option years.  Inquiries must be submitted in writing to Carrie Hickman at hickmanc@niaid.nih.gov by May 27, 2005 at 11:00 a.m. EDT.

The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The A E contracts are required to support military design and studies within or assigned to the Kansas City District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  Up to two indefinite delivery contracts will be negotiated and awarded, each with a total contract period not to exceed three years.

The contracts may include task orders with options for engineering and design, checking of shop drawings  and design during construction.   Task orders may be assigned for any work within the jurisdiction of Northwestern Division but the selection will be based on criteria within the Kansas City District.   Award of the first contract is anticipated in fourth  quarter, FY05.  Order of award of selected firms will be based on best fit between task order scopes and firm experience and capacity to accomplish work in the required timeframe.  The method used to allocate task orders among contracts will include consi deration of experience and user needs, capacity to accomplish the order in the required time frame, performance and quality of deliverables, and proximity of the firm to the project.  Funds are not presently available for the contracts.   North American Industrial Classification System code is 541310, which has a size standard of $4,000,000.00 in average annual receipts.   This announcement applies as follows. One of the two A-E IDT Contracts shall be Set-Aside and competed among Small Businesses only.

<CONTACT>Sheila Dimick, 405-954-7396
<DESC>Announcement is revised to specify delivery date:  All units must be delivered no later than September 30, 2005. To receive consideration as a potential source, vendors must provide documentation to substantiate their ability to manufacture the ARC Detectors.  Vendors must respond directly to the Contracting Officer by April 14, 2005.  The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing responses to this market survey.  Any proprietary information should be so marked.  This announcement shall not be construed as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the FAA to acquire these services.  Responders to this announcement may be asked to provide additional details/information based on their initial submittal.  The final determination by the FAA to recompete this requirement, based on any information provided, is solely within the discretion of the FAA. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) awarded contract DTFAAC-05-D-00028, February 9, 2005, for the acquisition of ARC detectors critical to the operation of the ASR-9 radars.  The NAICS code for this acquisition is 334511.  An Indefinite Quantity/Indefinite Delivery type was awarded for a Base Year with four-option years.  The award allows for a minimum guaranteed quantity of 10 with an annual estimated quantity of 50.  The estimated annual quantities were 50 for each option years.  However, due to changes in the FAA's requirement the basic year quantity will be increased to 198 units.  The estimated quantities on the option years will remain the same (50 each). Two first articles were required for this contract.  ARC detectors were to be manufactured in accordance with Specification, ARC Sensing Waveguide Elbow (Attachment 1); Drawing No. 1D20332 (Attachment 2); and Parts List PL1D20332 (Attachment 3), Even though this requirement was competitive only one offer was qualified and able to satisfy the FAA's requirement.  The intent of this announcement is to notify companies that may have previously shown an interest in this requirement of the change in the originally basic year quantity.  All other terms and conditions of the contract remain unchanged.   Any questions shall be in writing and directed to Sheila.dimick.@faa.gov, Contracting Officer, no later than April 14, 2005.

<DESC>The U.S. Air Force, Air Combat Command (ACC) Contracting Squadron, Langley AFB, Virginia is in the process of determining the acquisition strategy for a potential requirement for the operations, maintenance and support (O, M, & S) of Prepositioned War Reserve Materiel (WRM) stored in the Sultanate of Oman, State of Qatar, and State of Bahrain.  Services also require the operation of a supply stock control function and contractor liaison office at Shaw AFB, SC.  The United States Central Command Air Forces (USCENTAF), the designated air component of the United States Central Command (USCENTCOM), uses pre-positioned WRM to support apportioned forces deployed to Southwest Asia (SWA).  Pre-positioning is a force multiplier for providing bare base systems; medical; munitions; Tanks, Racks, Adapters, and Pylons (TRAP); Fuels Mobility Support Equipment (FMSE); vehicles; rations; Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE); Air Base Operability (ABO) equipment; and associated spares and other consumables at designated operating locations.  In the past, WRM operating locations have included SEEB, Oman; Thumrait, Oman; Masirah, Oman; Al Udeid, Qatar; Manama, Bahrain and Albany Georgia.  The performance period will be a four (4) month phase-in period, a base period of one (1) year, and six options for one (1) year each.  The Government is contemplating a cost-plus-award fee type contract to fulfill this requirement based on historical data and past market research.  The NAICS Code 561210 is applicable to this effort.  This is not a formal Request for proposal, and no contract will result from this synopsis.  A draft RFP is likely to be issued in order to obtain industry comments on the requirement.  All documents associated with this projected requirement will be made available only on the Electronic Posting System, FedBizOpps website at http://www.eps.gov.  To assist us, the Air Force requests the following information from potential offerors: (1) What is your company name, point of contact, mailing address, phone number, and e-mail address? (2) What is your business classification (e.g., large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, etc.)? (3) Are you interested in competing for this acquisition once/if the requirement becomes available on solicitation? (4) What type of corporate experience do you have that is similar to the type of work described above? (5) How many years of corporate experience does your firm have with requirements of this nature? (6) Of this experience, what has been the magnitude of the requirements? The Government anticipates a site visit in Southwest Asia on or about 2 Jun 05 and a Pre-proposal Conference at Langley AFB, VA, on or about 23 June 05.  Please advise of your availability to attend/participate in these two activities.  Also, please identify in your correspondence if items should be protected from release outside the government due to proprietary and/or competitive restrictions.  Interested parties should submit the requested information to the following POC by December 23, 2004:

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment (0004) is to extend the closing date of the solicitation and to answer vendor questions. A. Offers/quotes are now due no later than Thursday, April 14 at 3 p.m. Pacific Time. B. The following are answers to vendor questions: 1.  Question: What duty cycle is life of "20 years" based on?  (i.e., life is normally stated in terms of hours at full load or other defined duty cycle.) Answer:  It is estimated the unit will be operated approximately 800 hours per year for a lifetime usage of 16,000 hours 2.  Question: Is motor RPM really same as thruster RPM?  If yes, what is purpose of gear?  Who manufactures motor with such RPM? Answer: Government research indicates a motor developing 600HP at 678 RPM has a prohibitively long lead time. The gearbox is to allow the use of a standard single speed AC motor.  3.  Question: Please provide ship drawings in order to better ascertain space available? Answer: Please visit web site - http://www-keyport.kpt.nuwc.navy.mil/NECO/Solicitation.htm.  Please click on “request for quotes” to down load drawing.   4.  Question:  Thrust requirement is very low.  How do you plan to measure and confirm? Answer: The performance requirements were defined by the planning yard and a test memo will be developed to perform a bollard pull test.  5.  Question:  Solicitation has now changed to "sole source".  What is rationale and authority for this change?  Answer:  Only one responsible source and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements – Replacement Part.  Authority under 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). 6.  Question:  We assume motor starter, etc., not required.  Please confirm. Answer: Correct.  The motor must be compatible with an industry standard "soft start" motor controller. 7.  Question:  We assume that "or equal" applies.  Please confirm.  If not please advise price of your specified equipment.  Answer:  “Brand name or equal” does not apply.  Price unavailable at this time.

<DESC>The United States Department of Education has a requirement for a large, complex data collection that assesses how students and their parents pay for college.  The National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS) is designed to collect information on a nationally representative sample of students attending postsecondary institutions.  The study provides information about the costs of postsecondary education and how students and their families meet these costs.  Contract options include:  alternative collection of student lists (Options 1A or 1B); state-representative samples of students enrolled at public 2-year, public 4-year, private not-for-profit 4-year, and for-profit institutions (Options 2A or 2B); supplementing the sample size and questionnaire content to meet specific policy interests (Options 3 and 4, respectively); examining the effectiveness of offering incentives to increase participation of sampled students and postsecondary institutions (Option 5); and identifying and following-up students in their last year of undergraduate education (Options 6 and 7).  Data will be collected primarily via the web and include self-administered, telephone interview, and fieldwork.  Although different modes of collection are anticipated, the system will be web-based.  This study will culminate in documented data files, electronic codebooks, data analysis systems, and tabulations/descriptive reports for the base contract and option(s).  The anticipated RFP release date is

WDTC also plans, conducts, evaluates, and reports on non-CB testing for the Department of Defense (DoD) and other federal agencies, such as munition system assessm ents.  The WDTC regularly participates in the development and validation of technologies and methodologies to support assigned testing. The scope of effort involves supporting the WDTC test mission at the U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground (DPG), Utah installation.  The support involves (as associated with specific task orders) conducting technical studies associated with experimental design and statistical analysis, mathematical modeling, developing computer software applications, providing technical writing support, preparing test plans, preparing other documents associated with testing (e.g., environmental assessments), monitoring data acqu isition in the field, reducing and statistically analyzing data collected, preparing test reports, editing documents, preparing new documents and editing previously prepared Government documents in various stages of development, and preparing comments on G overnment documents.  WDTC is currently fully certified under the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9001-2000 Quality Management System.  WDTC is fully committed to this standard and continues working to stay fully compliant with the standard.  This requires maintaining extensive oversight of the overall WDTC quality system.  Because documents are one of WDTCs primary products, quality controls in the development of each document are critical to WDTCs success as an industry leader.  It is imperative that WDT C effectively control all documents associated with our testing environment.  Standing Operating Procedures (SOP), Test Operations Procedures (TOP), Division manuals, work instructions and all other test related documents must be secured and kept up to dat e.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION:
The US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is conducting a market research to identify organizations that have demonstrated experience in implementing the centralization of standalone workstations on a server to enable users of these workstations to access the workstation application programs independent of location.  This market research shall be conducted at NO COST TO THE GOVERNMENT.  This announcement is a Request For Information (RFI), not a solicitation for proposals, and accordingly, no contract will be awarded from this announcement.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests.  No telephone calls requesting a solicitation will be accepted or acknowledged.  There is no solicitation available at this time.  Industry responses, as a result of this announcement, shall focus on providing recommendations regarding the required technologies and best practices.   Each recommendation shall include a complete description of the recommended product or solution, why the product or solution is being put forth, how the implementation may benefit the USPTO, and a discussion as to the pros and cons of the recommendation as it relates to the USPTO or other federal government agencies.   

BACKGROUND:  

Most applications at the USPTO are generally composed of 16 bit and 32 bit client-server based applications were users access their applications and data residing on a server via a client residing on each user-assigned desktop (workstation).  A workstation is defined as an Intel X86 based cpu, supporting Windows XP, an Ethernet based Internet connection,  monitor, keyboard, and mouse.  As an effort to provide users the same functional experience as if they were using their assigned workstation independent of location or workstation,  the USPTO is requesting organizations with enabling technologies to respond with information that supports this effort.
The USPTO is evolving its application architecture and software engineering to include but not be limited to:  Linux, J2EE/JAVA, IBM WebSphere Suite (including the portal server, JAVA Studio Developer, and HTTP App Server), and Rational Unified Process. Most of the applications today at the USPTO are developed using technologies such as J2EE/Java, .NET, C, C++, Visual Basic, Microsoft Access, Excel, and some other scripting languages.
Requirements:
This section lists the high-level requirements for CORE-Net. 
CORE-Net will run existing application software, which runs on Windows XP, without modification of the application software.
CORE-Net will scale to about 6000 concurrent users.
CORE-Net will enable non-sensitive user data and user profile to be located in a centralized location.
CORE-Net shall support user operations for a tele-work environment.
CORE-Net must comply with both the USPTO security policies and the USPTO Remote Access Policy.
CORE-Net must provide a centralized monitoring and resource management capability.
CORE-Net will provide peer collaboration services between users.
CORE-Net will support use of generic Windows based workstations from within PTO Network or utilizing existing external access capabilities.
CORE-Net will be scalable, reliable, and extensible. User access from a workstation other than a USPTO assigned desktop shall not be different in terms of functional experience and response time.
CORE-Net is envisioned but not necessarily limited to a turnkey solution.
CORE-Net shall have a life cycle that is mutually exclusive from the operating system and application software.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.eps.gov/ and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil/. While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the Internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable. Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the NSWC Division Crane. Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division is looking for companies with the capabilities and facilities to provide COTS, NDI, or near NDI component technologies that can be incorporated into a primary function as a sound/flash suppressor for the MK13 MOD 0/1 .300 Winchester Magnum Sniper rifle, with a secondary function of the suppressor/attachments acting in the role of a muzzle break, reducing system recoil. The United States Special Operations Command intends to apply for approval of a Foreign Comparative Testing (FCT) project (http://cto.acqcenter.com/dac/bids/nsf) to evaluate candidate items. The government may decide to acquire for testing purposes one or more vendor products that appear to meet or exceed the stated criteria. Further, based on the results of testing, the government may procure and field the MK13 Muzzle Break Suppressor to meet military operational needs. The Muzzle Break Suppressor must be capable of mounting to the USSOCOM MK13 MOD 0/1 .300 Winchest! er Magnum sniper rifle. The deliverables will be 6/EA Muzzle Break/Suppressors for Government test and evaluation. The suppressors shall be rugged, highly reliable, corrosion resistant and capable of being maintained and operated by one person. The following Performance Parameters must be met:  1) The sound suppressor shall not degrade the function or performance of the weapon. Functional degradation includes: malfunctions, severe fouling problems, parts failure, excessive flash from any weapon opening, and/or excessive blowback or any other problem caused by suppressed operation. 2) The sound suppressor shall not use any artificial medium, e.g. grease, liquid, or membrane to reduce the sound pressure level and/or muzzle flash. 3) The sound suppressor shall reduce/distort the muzzle report and associated flash of the MK13 MOD 0/1 to prevent visual and auditory detection at ranges from 75 to 300 yards and reduce muzzle report to levels undetectable with the unaided ear to 300!  yards. (Auditory detection is defined as the ability to use the ballistic crack of the projectile as it passes the target/enemy and the muzzle report to form a ‘crack and/or thump’ correlation to detect the firing position.) 4) The sound suppressor when utilized shall not cause the Center of Group to shift more than 2 Minutes of Angle from the nominal unsuppressed Center of Group of the weapon. 5) If the sound suppressor causes a shift of impact to the baseline weapon, that shift shall be consistent and predictable. 6) The suppressor system shall exhibit a useful service life at a minimum of 5000 rds, with an objective service life of 10,000 rds.  Responses to this market survey are due on or before 27 April 2005, and must include a product description with performance parameters and a statement regarding current availability, indication of the technology readiness level or maturity of the technology, summary of prior testing, test reports, summary of logistic and maintenance requirements and an estimate for the price of test articles and production units. Interested parties should submit data of the item to Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Attn: Code 0562NH (John Pfender), Bldg. 2521, 300 Highway 361, Crane IN 47522. Questions may be submitted in writing to the above address, or emailed to john.pfender@navy.mil. No further information is available from the Procuring Office.

<DESC>DESC:  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  The National Cancer Institute intends to procure the services of the Hershey Medical Center of the Penn State College of Medicine, 500 University Drive, Hershey, PA 17033.  The support services are needed for the Cancer Etiology Branch of the Division of Cancer Biology as a follow-on contract to complete current requirements associated with Contract No. N02-CB-37025.  

Background: the Cancer Etiology Branch (CEB) of NCI’s Division of Biology, has a continuing requirement for the synthesis, purification, and characterization of a number of different research compounds of interest to the carcinogenesis research community.  The compounds are to be prepared in exploratory syntheses on a small scale and then prepared in a production run to yield one to several grams of sufficiently pure material (generally 99+  percent).  Compounds are to be characterized by a meaningful combination of appropriate techniques including specific activity; melting points; ultraviolet, visible and infrared spectroscopy; and NMR or mass spectroscopy.  Major responsibilities are: (1) resynthesis of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon PAH derivatives by established procedures for the restocking of NCI’s Chemical Carcinogen Reference Standards Repository as necessary, and (2) development of synthesis of selected chemical carcinogens, chemopreventive agents and certain of their metabolites or derivatives.  Distribution to the research community will be handled by the repository contractor all labeled and unlabeled compounds.  Labeled compounds will be subdivided and shipped to designated recipients in the research community either directly by the synthesis contractor or through the repository contractor.  The contractor shall be required to provide analytical, handling, and storage data with all shipments.  A high degree of cooperation with NCI, the repository contractor, and other synthesis program contractors is necessary.  

The Government anticipates one contract will be awarded on an incrementally funded basis for a total period of one (1) year.  The particular requirement for this contract centers around syntheses of chemical compounds from the following three categories:  Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) and their metabolites (including 1-hydroxybenzo[a]pyrene, 5-hydroxybenzo[c]phenanthrene, 11-hydroxybenzo[a]pyrene, 6,12-dimethylchrysene, anti-11,12-dihydroxy-13,14-epoxy-11,12,13,14-tetrahydrobenzo[g]chrysene, anti-1,2-dihydroxy-3,4-epoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-5,6-dimethylchrysene); Nitrosamines and tobacco-specific nitrosamines (including NNK and its metabolites, N-Methyl-N-nitroso-N-nitroguanidine, 
N-Nitrosoguavacoline, N-Nitroso methyl benzylamine); and Chemopreventive agents (including  SAHA and PBIT).  Since the intermediates and synthetic schemes have been developed by the investigators employed with the Hershey Medical Center, they meet the requirements of the FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2), in that they are the only responsible source that will satisfy the agencies requirements without significant cost in the loss of time and materials already invested in these syntheses. The estimated period of performance is September 30, 2005 through September 29, 2006.  The NAICS Code is 54170.  Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.  Numbered Note 22 applies.  No Collect Calls accepted.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE AVAILABLE.  The Naval Air Warfare Center (NAWC) Lakehurst is                                                                             requesting information pertaining to the feasibility of a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) Rear Ground Handling Wheel (RGHW).  The NAWC is looking for Ground Handling Wheels that would be immediately available, not items that are under test and/or development. The Naval Air Warfare Center is looking to test the Ground Handling Wheels in the near future, so items would need to be immediately available to meet these dates. The RGHW is planned to be used on the following H-1 Model aircraft (AH-1W, AH-1Z, UH-1N, UH-1Y, HH-1N).  A pair (two) of RGHW units are required to lift the aircraft from attachment points located on the rear of the 4 inch diameter aircraft skids.  Skid lugs provide the interface for attachment.  The dimensions, constraints and sketches for the skid lug and each aircraft will be provide upon request.  RGHW installation and removal from the aircraft should not require any special tooling, disassembly or assembly.  Rapid installation and removal by one person is required.  Maximum safe working limits for the RGHW are required to meet a maximum aircraft weight of 20,000 lbs.  The RGHW should allow for easy transport, by one person in a standing/walking position, to and from the aircraft.  It is desired that overall weight of the RGHW be kept to a minimum.  The target weight for a RGHW unit is 90 lbs or less.  RGHW should feature non-castering pneumatic wheels, which are suitable for towing speeds up to 10 MPH on pavement, shipboard non-skid decking and unmade surfaces such as gravel, dirt and stone.  The RGHW is required to lift the aircraft to a minimum height of 3.5 inches measured from the ground to the bottom of the skid at a point between the attachment skid lugs.  The RGHW lifting mechanism should not require external power (such as electric or pneumatic).  Actuation of the lifting mechanism, by one person, per RGHW unit, is a requirement. The RGHW is required to have a mechanism to allow the rapid lowering of the skids to the ground.  The target time to completely lower the skids is 3 seconds.  The RGHW requires a method for remote activation of the rapid lowing mechanism, which can be reached by one person during aircraft towing or spotting.  The remote activation device should be designed to fit the smallest RGHW envelope dimensions for stowage.  The remote activation device should not require any tooling to install on, or remove from, the RGHW.  When installed, the remote actuation device should be accessible at a target distance of 36 inches from the RGHW center and at a target height of 24 inches from the ground.  Location of the remote actuation device is limited due to aircraft configurations.  Access to the remote actuation device should be in line with the skid tube and either forward or aft of the RGHW.  A design goal is to have a remote activation device that can be positioned either forward or aft of the RGHW.  The envelope dimensions for the RGHW unit, not including the remote activation device is available upon request.  Note that there are multiple aircraft configurations that will limit the envelope dimensions.

Please provide commercial pamphlets, operating and maintenance manual or any other documentation that would describe a unit/s or system/s to meet the above requirement.  It is requested that information be submitted NO LATER THAN 05/12/05 to Ms. Jessica Schoenleber, Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Code 25232B562-1, Highway 547, Lakehurst, NJ 08733-5082, All responses must be hardcopy, no electronic submissions allowed.  Ms. Schoenleber may be reached at (732) 323-7789.  Respondents are notified that a formal solicitation MAY NOT necessarily result from the RFI.  Any comments provided may or may not be included in a formal solicitation.  The Government WILL NOT PAY for any information received in response to this RFI nor will the Government compensate any respondent with costs incurred in developing the information provided to the Government.  The Government will not release any information marked with a Proprietary legend, received in response to this RFI, to any firms, agencies, or individuals outside the Government without written permission in accordance with the legend.

<DESC>The United States Coast Guard, Maintenance and Logistics Command, Atlantic is seeking sources that can provided the following services for a prototype engine overhaul/modification of a single diesel engine on a 140’ WTGB Icebreaking tugboat located at Sault St. Marie, MI.  Overhaul/Modification will be done at the vessels homepier in Sault St. Marie, MI.  Unit Exchange/Reconditioning.  Services being requested are: (1) Evaluate the existing diesel engine’s salient features, to include the operating conditions, conditions of the existing machinery, review of the available service records of the engine, and the application of OEM and after-market components.  (2) Install exchange or rebuilt fuel injection pumps to produce a change to the existing injection timing of the engine to achieve higher exhaust temps at lower engine loads.  (3) Install an external motor-driven vacuum fan to ensure that the engine remains under proper vacuum irrespective of engine speed.  (4) Install an air-operated, PLC controlled, temperature control valve in the engine’s jacket water system.  The valve will be configured to regulate jacket water temperature based on existing lube oil temperature.  (5) Install a PLC control panel to control the above mentioned control valve as well as the existing air by-pass actuator for the installed blower.  (6)  Install a  crankshaft air seal to reduce lost crankcase vacuum.  (7) Calibrate the existing Lube Oil Sump bayonet gage to ensure it complies with engine OEM Service Bulletin, Volume “A”, Issue 12, dated June 22, 1987.  (8) Perform an inspection of the engine’s existing vertical drive shaft assembly and provide a report on the condition of the components relative to the OEM tech manual.  (9) Perform an inspection of the engine’s existing roots blower and provide a report on the condition of the components relative to the EOM tech manual.  The inspection shall include the conduct of an air test.  (10) Perform an inspection of the engine’s existing gear train at the free end of the engine and provide a report on the condition of the components relative to the OEM tech manual.  This upgrade/overhaul is a prototype modification that will address documented concerns associated with light load operation, while maintaining optimum high icebreaking steady state and transient performance.  The light load concerns include excessive oil injection into the exhaust manifolds and piping.  Excessive exhaust oil injection also leads to the cutter’s topside surfaces getting coated with a slippery film of oil.  The oil injection is also an environmental concern, whether carried directly into the sea, or into the bilge.  The second primary low load concern is high smoke opacity.  The prototype upgrade/overhaul goals are intended to demonstrate a Fairbanks Morse Engines proprietary modification approach that will successfully address the low load concerns, while maintaining optimum icebreaking steady state and transient load performance.  The USCG does not have access to the proprietary baseline design data (as-built drawings) required to formulate the necessary modification to allow the engine to operate in a different manner.  The engine is a unique opposed piston design.  One of the environmental concerns associated with the 140’ WTGB MSA main engine design decision is whether a modified Fairbanks Morse 8-38D8-1/8 engine will have to meet Environmental Protection Agency Tier 2 exhaust emission requirements.  There may be vendors that can repair and tune the FBM diesel, but as a result of these unique design characteristics, it is believed that only the OEM, Fairbanks Morse Engine Division, possesses the design criteria, historical expertise, and technical ability to develop a new load-carrying profile for this engine.  The desired outcome of the engine modification should allow the vessel to operate safely and environmentally compliant at lower vessel speeds associated with new DHS Law Enforcement duties.  Any other business sources, able to provide the above listed parts and services are encouraged to respond to this announcement within 10 days of its publication.  Interested firms should submit in writing, its name, address, point of contact, telephone number, business size and a brief statement regarding it capability to provide the services and experience working on this type of engine.  Firms must provide how they have access to the proprietary information to perform the modification.  The information should be submitted to the address stated herein or may be faxed to telephone number 757-628-4676, ATTN:  Lisa Dieli.  The small business size standard is less than 1000 employees and the NAICS Code is 333618.  This is not a request for proposals and there is no solicitation.  All responsible sources may respond.

<DESC>Sources Sought for Power Amplifiers, Antennas and / or supporting technologies This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to award any contract. There is no solicitation available at this time.  Requests for solicitations will receive no response.  This sou rces sought synopsis is published for market research purposes only. The Technical Support Working Group (TSWG) is seeking sources capable of providing information to explore options for development of ultra wide band radio systems.  This sources sought is to identify potential sources to support a technical approach to pro vide modular concept demonstrators which are aimed at pushing the boundaries of current available technology. This announcement seeks to establish the feasibility of providing a RF transmission system for man-portable use comprising an integrated power amplifier and antenna system optimized for instantaneous broadband ground wave cover.  No specification for the P A / Antenna interface is included since the design may wish to take advantage of a non-50& termination, however the eventual system will be required to provide high speed receive / transmit switching and therefore this interface is specified. Ultimately th is system will comprise part of backpack-mounted equipment for military dismounted / foot patrol use or adaptable to a vehicle fit.    Sources must have demonstrated and proved technical knowledge and experience to address the following characteristics:  I. Power Amplifier Characteristics Instantaneous bandwidth:  10MHz-2.5GHz Output power:  +40dBm with not less than 70% power delivered into a 3:1 VSWR (note: no more than 1.55 dB reduction in power due to realistic antenna mismatch) Overall Efficiency:  Greater than 25%  3rd order intercept point:  +55dBm Gain:  +40dBm Output Impedance:  Optimized for antenna but PA must be able to Operate and survive into a short or open circuit load and provide a 50& monitoring port (Note: We are seeking PA performance which will survive 100% power reflection at any phase angle. This i s to make sure that an open or short circuit anywhere along the antenna feed (i.e. any electrical length) will not cause a dangerous voltage of current to occur in the PA. The 50 Ohm monitoring port allows the host equipment to carry out its built in test . Input impedance:  50&   VSWR 3:1 Power up / down time:  less than 10mS Supply voltage:  Optimized for use Ambient temperature range:  -20oC to +85 oC Size:  10x5x3cm II. Antenna Characteristics Height:  Not greater than 1.2m above backpack equipment Diameter:  Not greater than 4cm diameter (Note:  may be thicker in places, but dont want to end up with a metronome) Construction:  Appropriate for military foot patrol environment.  Ideally it should be a one-element system taking the form of a whip antenna but a multi-element system is acceptable Bandwidth:  10MHz-2.5GHz Radiation pattern:  Optimized for omni directional ground wave.  Propagation over the entire frequency range Efficiency:  0 dBi at 100MHz and above.  Below 100MHz a maximum loss of  6dB/Octave is acceptable Ground plane:  If required the backpack equipment may be used as a ground plane (25cm W x 10cm D x 40cm H) Switching:  A 50& receive port will be required and this port should provide a maximum 1mS switching time with 40dB transmitter path isolation and 3dB receive path loss.  Switching waveform to be at 3.3V CMOS level. Submission packages must be identified by:  Sources Sought for Power Amplifiers, Antennas and/or supporting technologies.  Submissions should include a capability statement that satisfies the above requirements in no more than ten pages.  Submissions shall  include a summary of technical experience and work associated with this type of need.     Responses to this request must be received within thirty (30) working days upon release of this announcement.  Technical questions should be addressed electronically to the Tactical Operations Support Program Manager at tossubgroup@tswg.gov and all responses should be submitted electronically to the contracting officer jacqueline.renee.hodge@ us.army.mil and or the contract specialist regina.faulkner@us.army.mil. This synopsis should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose.  This Sources Sought synopsis is not a request for proposal; it is a market research tool.  Any information submitted by respondents to this sources sought, are strict ly voluntary.  The Government will not pay for any information that is submitted by respondents to this sources sought request.  All documentation shall become the property of the Government.

<DESC>D - FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENT PROJECT  - REQUEST FOR INFORMATION.  The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) will implement a new core financial management capability and related administrative functions using Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) software packages.  Accordingly, by this Request for Information (RFI) HUD is beginning its survey of the commercial marketplace and other sources of off-the-shelf software to assess the technical and functional attributes of JFMIP compliant financial management and other related application software currently available.  The information will be used exclusively by HUD support staff to assist in systems acquisition planning.  Commercial software for which HUD is seeking information include Budget Formulation; Agency system to produce Office of Management and Budget and Congressional submissions; Database structures to support ad hoc queries; Reports -- Actual vs. Planned at various levels; Obligations vs. costs at various levels; SF 132 and supporting schedules; Budget allocation and funds control; Core Accounting (general ledger, accounts payable, accounts receivable, cost accounting asset management, cost management) and reporting, including budget execution; obligation processing; expenditure tracking; cash management; workflow automation and federal financial assistance reporting including grants; voucher payment; Procurement; Purchase Orders/Small Purchases; Contracts; Executive Information System; Expendable Inventory Supply (acquisitions and issues); Training Requests; Orders; and Budgeting.   The COTS software will need to interface with eTravel, Treasury, Payroll, bankcard, a subsidiary ledger, and several program systems.  GOALS - HUD's goal in implementing these systems include: (1) Integration and standardization of data and systems across all HUD offices. (2) Providing management with access to timely and accurate financial, budget, asset and related information on programs and projects. (3) Implementation of advanced technology to provide the greatest capability and an extended life cycle. SCOPE - These systems will be used to support all HUD's field installations and headquarters (approximately 81 region and field sites) and for the management of HUD's budgetary appropriation of approximately $ 30 billion per year. ENVIRONMENT - All HUD facilities are interconnected via a high-speed computer network that is a part of the Internet. HUD maintains its own backbone network based on the TCP/IP protocol and having direct links to local area networks at each field location. It should be assumed that any HUD employee using these applications would be equipped with a personal computer (IBM compatible) and a local area network connection providing connectivity to any other HUD location. SURVEY OBJECTIVES - Objectives of this survey include obtaining an understanding of and making assessments about appropriate COTS application software with respect to: I. Currently available and planned future functional capabilities in the near term (2-3 years) in the areas of, Business processes supported; Application capabilities and; Human engineering and usability testing applied; If multiple architectures are offered provide information on functional (application) differences, for instance, between vendor's mainframe and client/server-based systems. II. Will current application software capabilities pass independent third party testing for compliance with Joint Financial Management Improvement Program (JFMIP) requirements? III. Currently available technology and planned technology capabilities in the near term (2-3 years): A. Fundamental technologies employed, including but not limited to: - Client/server architecture; - Graphical User Interface (GUI) and development tools; - Electronic Data Interchange (EDI; - Electronic Commerce (EC); - Digital signatures; - Security (data and system); - Object capabilities (language, database, architecture (CORBA). B. Support for and compliance with standards: - X/Open Portability Guide, Issue 4; Structured Query Language (SQL); - Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA); - TCP/IP; - any others utilized. C. Scalability: The degree to which the systems support workgroup operations and how they scale to support enterprise wide data integration and retrieval. D. Implementation Environment: - Computer platform requirements; - Operating system requirements; - Database requirements (vendors, types, structure, etc.); - Application language(s); - Application structure, integration, etc.; - Data query, download/upload capabilities. E. Architecture: What architecture options are available for implementing your application in the HUD environment? Does it support a distributed environment? F.  What Centers of Excellence currently host this COTS software?  IV. Business/Other: Identify potential for on-line Internet access to application software and a test data base at vendor's own facility; Status and readiness of software or planned readiness dates for future capabilities; At least 3 financial COTS customer references with contact names and telephone numbers; company qualifications, financials, history with core financial COTS installations. HUD is not, at this time, restricting its survey to those financial management software packages listed on the Financial Management Systems Software (FMSS) schedule developed by the General Services Administration (GSA). While those packages will be considered, HUD wants to survey the entire commercial marketplace to ensure its programmatic and technology goals will be met by the best available COTS product. HUD is seeking comprehensive information for planning purposes. Responses are requested if you can provide: Any part of the relevant applications; tools for system integration, or tools for use in data conversion. It is requested that you complete the matrices for our internal evaluation located on the following HUD web page - http://www.hud.gov/offices/cpo/contract/de82cots.cfm.  Please respond to and answer the all questions in the evaluation criteria.  It is requested that this information be submitted no later than Monday, May 2, 2005, in the form of a ''white paper'', limited to no more than 50 pages in length.  Additional JFMIP responses, informational brochures or user manuals are needed if available. User Manuals and other documentation are not subject to the 50-page limitation. Any material submitted will not be returned. It is requested that the white paper be submitted electronically via CD for IBM compatible PCs using Microsoft Office 2000 compatible/readable products. HUD reserves the right to contact vendors, to provide clarifications on capabilities or to ask questions.
