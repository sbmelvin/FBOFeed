<DESC>VA National Center for PTSDStatement of work request7/14/2008Project: Foreign Language Indexing DESCRIPTION OF WORK The National Center for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is seeking to expand the PILOTS Database by including relevant foreign language articles including German, Spanish, and Russian articles.  PILOTS is available through the website http://www.ncptsd.va.gov.  Since 1995 the website has grown to be an invaluable source of information on traumatic stress for millions of people.  We are increasingly acknowledged as the "go-to" source for the latest research and best clinical practices available in the field.This will allow the PILOTS Database to offer additional foreign language articles that are properly indexed.  The National Center for PTSD will supply a librarian to work with the contractor to aid with the use of the PILOTS Thesaurus and to ensure inter-indexer consistency.  The librarian will select the articles to index.  The contractor will supply 250 hours of bibliographical indexing services and index a minimum of 125 articles to be selected from a range of specialist journals including Trauma und Gewalt, Traumatologie, and Zeitschrift fr Psychotraumatologie und Psychologische Medizin, and general journals such as Nervenarzt, Psyche, and Verhaltenstherapie.Work Required:"	250 hours of bibliographical services (indexing of German-language journal articles and other publications (Spanish and Russian), with abstracting and translation as required)."	This will be an iterative process, requiring some discussion between the contractor and the librarian, and perhaps a bit of trial-and-error for the first few articles. As the indexer becomes more familiar with the subject matter and the PILOTS Thesaurus, it should take him a diminishing amount of time to index each article. DELIVERABLES:"	Indexing for at least 125 foreign language articles.SKILLS NEEDED"	Expert understanding of foreign languages to include German, Spanish, and Russian."	Understanding of and experience with abstracting and indexing procedures to the level normally obtained by a graduate degree in library or information science "	Ability to read and understand psychiatric, psychological, and psychoanalytic literature and to summarize and describe it to PILOTS Database standards"	Knowledge of Traumatic Stress literature desiredEVALUATIONFACTOR 1: EXPERIENCE AND TECHNICAL APPROACHa)	Fully describe your understanding of the basic concepts of psychiatry, clinical psychology, and psychoanalysisb)	Demonstrate proficiency in the use of enumerative bibliography and subject indexing of foreign language publications.c)	Include a resume of professional work.d)	Include a list of languages you are proficient in reading.FACTOR 2: PAST PERFORMANCEa)	Describe your past experience indexing articles in foreign languages. FACTOR 3: COST/PRICEa)	The pricing proposal should be specific and separate from the technical proposal.  It shall contain supporting cost information in sufficient detail to indicate how the offer or arrived at the proposed prices.  Factor 1: Experience and technical approach	Mandatory items satisfied	Total Maximum Points	Rating	CommentsSub factors:  a)  Knowledge of German, Spanish, and Russian languages as they are used in medical, psychological, and psychoanalytic literature.				b)  Understanding of the principles of enumerative bibliography and subject indexing.				c)  For each publication* submit an English-language translation of the title.  				d)  Submit an English-language abstract of each publication*. 				e)  .

<DESC>VA National Center for PTSDStatement of work request7/14/2008Project: Foreign Language Indexing DESCRIPTION OF WORK The National Center for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is seeking to expand the PILOTS Database by including relevant foreign language articles including German, Spanish, and Russian articles.  PILOTS is available through the website http://www.ncptsd.va.gov.  Since 1995 the website has grown to be an invaluable source of information on traumatic stress for millions of people.  We are increasingly acknowledged as the "go-to" source for the latest research and best clinical practices available in the field.  This award is not expected to exceed $25,000.00.This will allow the PILOTS Database to offer additional foreign language articles that are properly indexed.  The National Center for PTSD will supply a librarian to work with the contractor to aid with the use of the PILOTS Thesaurus and to ensure inter-indexer consistency.  The librarian will select the articles to index.  The contractor will supply 250 hours of bibliographical indexing services and index a minimum of 125 articles to be selected from a range of specialist journals including Trauma und Gewalt, Traumatologie, and Zeitschrift fr Psychotraumatologie und Psychologische Medizin, and general journals such as Nervenarzt, Psyche, and Verhaltenstherapie.  For full RFP document please contact Stacy Sullivan at stacy.sullivan@va.gov .  Work Required:"	250 hours of bibliographical services (indexing of German-language journal articles and other publications (Spanish and Russian), with abstracting and translation as required)."	This will be an iterative process, requiring some discussion between the contractor and the librarian, and perhaps a bit of trial-and-error for the first few articles. As the indexer becomes more familiar with the subject matter and the PILOTS Thesaurus, it should take him a diminishing amount of time to index each article. DELIVERABLES:"	Indexing for at least 125 foreign language articles.SKILLS NEEDED"	Expert understanding of foreign languages to include German, Spanish, and Russian."	Understanding of and experience with abstracting and indexing procedures to the level normally obtained by a graduate degree in library or information science "	Ability to read and understand psychiatric, psychological, and psychoanalytic literature and to summarize and describe it to PILOTS Database standards"	Knowledge of Traumatic Stress literature desiredEVALUATIONFACTOR 1: EXPERIENCE AND TECHNICAL APPROACHa)	Fully describe your understanding of the basic concepts of psychiatry, clinical psychology, and psychoanalysisb)	Demonstrate proficiency in the use of enumerative bibliography and subject indexing of foreign language publications.c)	Include a resume of professional work.d)	Include a list of languages you are proficient in reading.FACTOR 2: PAST PERFORMANCEa)	Describe your past experience indexing articles in foreign languages. FACTOR 3: COST/PRICEa)	The pricing proposal should be specific and separate from the technical proposal.  It shall contain supporting cost information in sufficient detail to indicate how the offer or arrived at the proposed prices.  Factor 1: Experience and technical approach	Mandatory items satisfied	Total Maximum Points	Rating	CommentsSub factors:  a)  Knowledge of German, Spanish, and Russian languages as they are used in medical, psychological, and psychoanalytic literature.				b)  Understanding of the principles of enumerative bibliography and subject indexing.				c)  For each publication* submit an English-language translation of the title.  				d)  Submit an English-language abstract of each publication*. 				e)  .
