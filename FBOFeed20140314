<DESC>This is a Notice of Proposed Contract Action under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (FAR 13) and Other Than Full and Open Competition (FAR 6.302-1)&nbsp;&nbsp; Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. This notice is for information only; a solicitation will not be issued. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 423690 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.
<p>AFRL requires 15 extended temperature range absolute optical encoders for use on the outdoor antenna positioner systems at the Newport Research Site. These devices will be part of the systems that feed positioner location data (azimuth and elevation) to the data acquisition systems.</p>
<p>The same&nbsp;encoders were purchased in 2013 as they were the only encoders available that met the extended temperature range for the AFRL requirement -40 degrees Celsius to 90 degrees Celsius.&nbsp;After the purchase&nbsp;additional electronics had to be designed and built, along with significant software development, to integrate the encoders into existing data acquisition systems.</p>
<p>The Government intends to negotiate a sole source contract with BEI Sensors, 7230 Hollister Ave., Goleta, CA 93117.</p>
<p>The Government has determined that no other source can meet the requirement as if other than the specified encoders are purchased than the government must reinvest the time and cost to redevelop the hardware and software to interface to this device. Furthermore, months of additional testing will be required to substantiate the viability of any new encoder. Such that this substantial duplication of cost is not expected to be recovered through competition.</p>
<p>This is a notice of proposed contract action and not a request for competitive proposals; however, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement or proposal, which shall be considered by the agency. All inquiries should be sent by email to Andrey.Selyuzhitskiy@us.af.mil. Responses must be submitted by the date/time listed on the notice. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in future procurements.</p>
<p>Responses received will be evaluated; however a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government anticipates an award date on or before 4 April 2014.</p>
<p>A Sole Source Justification will be attached to the subsequent Notice of Award.</p>

<DESC>NASA/ARC anticipates a requirement for design and development of electronics prototypes and engineering models in support of a proposed Mars-2020 investigation entitled Mapping alpha-particle X-Ray Spectrometer (Map-X). ARCs Map-X instrument will assist in the identification of rocks and soils which have the potential for harboring and preserving bio-signatures.	Specifically, ARC intends to procure the design and development of the Camera Head Electronics and Control & Processing Electronics.  The design will incorporate low-noise camera electronics for operating a Charge Coupled Device (CCD) imager in single x-ray photon counting mode with low background and high energy resolution.  The hardware design must provide a low-risk implementation plan, operate successfully in high radiation environments, and be able to withstand the harsh thermal environment of the Mars surface. <P> NASA/ARC intends to purchase these services from Baja Technology, LLC, subject to selection of the proposed investigation and  the availability of funds.  A sole source award is necessary because there is only a single contractor available with the required experience and proven capability as demonstrated via design and development of similar instruments with a successful performance record both in space and on the surface of Mars. <P> The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. <P> Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. PDT, March 29, 2014.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. <P> Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the Agency. <P> NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at <A HREF="http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html">http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/p ub_library/Omb.html </A>      .

The herbicide application is a component of an overall strategy, which includes the removal of encroaching pinyon-juniper and the construction of an exclosure to prevent the overutilization of riparian vegetation by horses and livestock, to restore the riparian areas in Dalton Canyon so they provide ideal habitat for greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus), mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), and other wildlife.

This procurement is a follow-on contract to provide technical maintenance and service support for reverse osmotic water purification systems that are presently operated within the Division of Laboratory Sciences and are subject to constant use.
<p><br />The purpose of this contract is to procure the services and technical expertise from the only qualified contractor who can provide the factory authorized replacement parts/equipment necessary to complement existing equipment from the same manufacturer.

For these reasons, it is necessary to use Aqua Solutions, Incorporated, to meet the Agency's recurring requirement. As the manufacturer of the current instrumentation and equipment installed in DLS, Aqua Solutions RODI Reverse Osmotic Water Purification Systems located in the laboratory supports CDC/NCEH/DLS's general public health activities by providing quality research grade water meeting the standards required for baseline studies, Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) inspections, and analytical standards in ongoing research. Due to CDC's national emergency response role in environmental studies and response to chemical terrorism events, it is critical that these highly integrated water purification system components are expertly designed, built and maintained. <br /><br />CDC intends to negotiate this requirement with Aqua Solutions, Incorporated, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(2), Only One Responsible Source, and 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1). Aqua Solutions, Incorporated, is the only source available to provide preventative maintenance, inspections, and repairs of Aqua Solutions Reverse Osmotic Water Purification Systems that meets mission critical requirements. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination to compete this procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

Capability statements must include details on how the Offeror proposes to provide factory authorized parts, technically skilled labor for Aqua Solutions products and how the Offeror proposes to perform services without negating the warranty of system components.

<DESC>NASAs Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) intends to execute a six-month effective ordering period extension to the specialized suite of contracts that supply information technology (IT) equipment and software to the Federal Government through a Government-Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) specifically identified as Solutions for Enterprise Wide Procurement (SEWP) IV.	The effective ordering period of the current SEWP IV contracts expires on April 31, 2014, and the requested six-month extension will extend this period through October 31, 2014. The following contracts listed below require the requested six-month extension to their effective ordering periods.  An increase to the current maximum ordering value of $5.6B is not required, as the current value is considered more than sufficient to cover orders placed through October 31, 2014. Alliance Technology		NNG07DA10B Dell Federal Systems		NNG07DA15B Force 3 Inc.			NNG07DA11B/ NNG07DA18B Four Points Tech		NNG07DA16B Hewlett Packard (HP)		NNG07DA17B IBM				NNG07DA12B PCMG, Inc.

NNG07DA52B SoftChoice Corp 		NNG07DA37B Unicom Government		NNG07DA33B/ NNG07DA49B World Wide Technology		NNG07DA41B <P> The contract extensions are required to ensure uninterrupted support to meet critical requirements until the follow-on competitive contracts are awarded.  This procurement action is being conducted in accordance with 10 U.S.C  2304(c)(1), only from a limited number of responsible sources.	The highly automated and optimized acquisition schedule enables customers to get critical items for a wide diversity of projects and programs not obtainable elsewhere in the Federal Government within the required time frame.	SEWP, unlike any other available GWAC, is centered on high end, state-of-the-art technology. Delay in the award of the extensions to SEWP IV contracts will result in serious injury to major Government programs by either the unavailability of the required hardware/software and/or additional financial cost.  It is not practical or cost effective to conduct a full and open competition for six months of support as a precursor to the award of a follow-on contract. <P> Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on March 28, 2014.  Interested organizations must provide documentation which establishes its capability in the required areas including documentation of past relevant experience. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. <P> Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. <P> NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.

<DESC>The NASA Shared Services Center (NSSC) opened for business on March 1, 2006, and is located on NASAs Stennis Space Center in Hancock County, Mississippi. The establishment of the NSSC enabled the Agency to consolidate, at one location, over 50 financial management, human resources, information technology, and procurement activities, previously performed at all NASA Centers. Through the consolidation and standardization of these activities at the NSSC, the Agency has been able to realize operational efficiencies and improved customer service. <P> The NSSC plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the recompetition of its NSSC support services contract. This procurement will be conducted on an unrestricted basis (full and open competition) utilizing FAR Part 15 source selection procedures. <P> The anticipated release date of the draft RFP is on or about May 2, 2014. The NSSC intends to hold an Industry Day at or near Stennis Space Center on or about May 15, 2014. The anticipated release date of the final RFP is on or about July 15, 2014 with offers due approximately 45 days later. <P> The NSSC intends to award a single firm-fixed-price (FFP) IDIQ contract with pricing and ordering provisions that will permit (1) well-defined, transactional services to be ordered on a per transaction basis utilizing FFP service rates and (2) other less-defined services to be ordered on a level-of-effort basis, utilizing a series of established labor categories and fully burdened, FFP labor rates. <P> This contract is anticipated to have a period of performance of five years, consisting of a base period of two years and three 1-year options. To incentivize sustained, superior contract performance, the contract will also contain an award term option provision that will provide the contractor with the opportunity to earn up to three additional option years. The total potential period of performance, including all options and award term options, is eight years. <P> Significant small business subcontracting goals for small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns will be included in the contract. <P> The NAICS Code and Size Standard are 561110 and annual receipts less than $7.0 Million, respectively. <P> The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	  <P> NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Department of Energy (DOE) have a 30 year ongoing partnership at the National Synchrotron Light Source (building to NSLS-II) developing advanced synchrotron measurement methods and delivering excellence in material science impacting important societal challenges in energy, health, environment, and national security improving our quality of life. The NSLS-II will enable NIST to develop, apply and disseminate synchrotron measurement science and technology to the U.S. industry to measure nanoscale electronic, chemical and spatial structure of advanced materials. These advanced materials include multilayers, nanotubes, nanoparticles and thin films. The partnership between NIST and DOE promotes innovation and enhances US industrial competiveness for inorganic and organic semiconductors, photovoltaics, SAMs, biological and environmental materials, batteries, catalysts, fuel cells, polymers, superconductors, ferroelectrics, and ferromagnets. Located at the NSLS in Upton, NY, the NIST Synchrotron Methods Group of nine operates a suite of three state-of-the-art spectroscopy beamlines (U7A, X24A, and X23A2) that span the entire absorption-edge energy range of the periodic table to establish structure function relationships in advanced materials. More than 200 industry and academic researchers each year use the NIST Beamline Suite to accelerate the development of new materials into devices and systems with advanced functionality for a broad spectrum of industries. Building upon this success, NIST will establish an NSLS-II spectroscopy suite of three state-of-the-art high throughput beamlines (with X-ray Diffraction capability); Soft and Tender X-ray Spectroscopy and Microscopy (SST - 100 eV to 7.5 keV canted sources) and Hard X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy and Diffraction (Beamline for Materials Measurement - BMM - 4.5 keV to 40 keV three-pole wiggler source). Taken together, the NIST NSLS-II Spectroscopy Beamline Suite will be capable of measuring the electronic, chemical, and structural properties of almost any material, often at the nanoscale.
<p><br />The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is building a pair of NSLS-II spectroscopy beamlines based on two canted undulator sources, one for soft x-rays (100 eV to 2.2 keV) and one for tender x-rays (1 keV to 7.5 keV). The beamlines will have a total of 6 unique world class NEXAFS/XPS experimental stations (2 full field microscopes, 2 automated high-throughput, and 2 insitu high pressure); three will be served by the soft x-ray undulator and three by the tender x-ray undulator, thus a variety of soft and tender spectroscopy experiments can be accomplished simultaneously in this beamline complex. Two of the experimental stations (high-throughput XPS/NEXAFS and the XPS microscope) can utilize the soft and tender X-ray undulators (sequentially or even simultaneously) enabling a continuous selection of X-rays from 100 eV to 7.5 keV (at a common focal point) in a single experiment (unique capability, enhancing depth selectivity in XPS; i.e. in Hard X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy - HAXPES).</p>
<p>The items to be acquired are the NIST NSLS-II SST Beamline Backbones and NIST NSLS-II BMM Beamline Mirror Systems which transfers and focuses the NSLS-II x-rays for the Large AREA NEXAFS Microscope for NSLS-I/II (and other endstations detailed above) produced by an NSLS-II canted tender (low energy) undulator.</p>
<p>This requirement is being procured using acquisition of commercial items and contracting by negotiations under the authority of FAR Parts 12 and 15.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.</p>
<p>The competitive Request for Proposals (RFP), specifications, any subsequent amendments, and all questions and answers related to this procurement shall be made available via the Internet at www.fbo.gov under RFP number SB1341-13-RP-0062.</p>
<p>The RFP is anticipated for release to the vendor community on or about April 7, 2014 and will only be available via the Internet at the above website.</p>

If the NQF adopts its proposed two-stage consensus development process, the report should be separated to address each stage.&nbsp; Phase 1 addresses VR-12 while Phase 2 addresses PROMIS-29, although a strongly justified alternate proposal for a different measure for Phase 1 may be considered.<br /><br />Phase 1 involves the analysis of existing data on health-related quality of life on persons with MCCs.&nbsp;<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Source of Data for Phase 1</span>:&nbsp; For this phase, offerors should specify and justify their proposed source of data which is suitable for conducting the required analyses, and assure its availability.&nbsp; Offerors should provide sample size, disease ascertainment, outcome measures and a power calculation for three main analyses.&nbsp; Potential sources of data for this phase include but are not limited to 1) the Medicare Health Outcomes Survey (<a href="http://www.hosonline.org/Content/Default.aspx">http://www.hosonline.org/Content/Default.aspx</a>) from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 2) Health ABC (<a href="http://www.grc.nia.nih.gov/branches/ledb/healthabc/index.htm">http://www.grc.nia.nih.gov/branches/ledb/healthabc/index.htm</a>) available from the National Institute on Aging; 3) linkage of the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) with the Medicare Health Outcomes Survey (MHOS) known as SEER-MHOS and available from the National Cancer Institute; 4) Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) which is co-sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS).</p>
<p><br />Phase 2 involves the collection and analysis of data using the PROMIS-29 profile and other instruments from a sample of persons age 65 and over with MCCs.&nbsp; Many short forms developed by the PROMIS group for self-administration to patients have been tested for reliability, face validity (through focus groups, expert panels, cognitive interviewing), construct validity (convergent and discriminate validity) and differential item functioning testing. The PROMIS tools, in particular the PROMIS-29 Profile measure, have not been extensively tested in an adult population age 65 and over.&nbsp; Testing of the PROMIS measures was done via the internet with a primarily healthy adult population. The sample size of older adults, particularly the very old (over age 80 years), was limited.&nbsp; Additional research and analysis is necessary to test the validity of the PROMIS tools in an older adult population with multiple chronic conditions and advance toward a potential quality measure for outpatient care.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<DESC><p>The Naval Research Laboratory has a need for a nominal 67 HP, 300 VDC submersible motor system consisting of a hydrostatic pressure compensated motor, controller/drive electronics, pressure housing to contain the drive electronics, and hydrostatic pressure tolerant cabling. It is required that the motor drive controller be enclosed in a pressure vessel capable of withstanding hydrostatic pressure ranging from 14 psia to 682 psia. All other equipment, external to the controller/drive electronics pressure housing, shall be capable of operating while withstanding hydrostatic pressure of 14 psia up to 10,014 psia. Electrical connections for power, feedback, and communication\control signals will be provided through appropriate SEACON connectors mounted on the waist of the pressure vessel. Other critical features include its efficiency at low and high power and its weight. The nominal voltage of the system is 300 V. The motor system will employ conductive cooling through the pressure vessel housing to ambient surrounding water. The volume of surrounding water will not have active flow around the pressure housing(s) of the motor or controller. The motor system will be capable of quiet operation and operating at or below the acoustic levels defined in the RFP. Standard MIL-SPECs will be applied for shock, EMI, environmental conditions, etc.</p>

Upon confirmation of eligibility, potential offerors will be sent a copy of the specifications. The specifications must be safeguarded and protected from unauthorized disclosure in accordance with applicable U.S. export control laws and regulations.</p>
<p>Based on a survey of the market, the government has determined that the services to be acquired do not meet the definition of a commercial item. Therefore, the government does not intend to use the procedures as outlined in FAR Part 12 for this acquisition.</p>

<DESC>This synopsis is not a request for quotes or proposals. This is a notice that a solicitation for a competitive acquisition for the award of one firm-fixed price contract is scheduled to be released via FedBizOpps (www.fbo.gov) in the near future.  The Technical Specifications will be detailed in the solicitation. This announcement is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, implied or otherwise, to issue a solicitation or award a contract. <br>  <br> Quotes will be due approximately 15 days from the date the solicitation is issued, however, the 15 day time frame is an estimate and subject to change.  The definitive quote due date and time will be stated in the solicitation and any associated amendments that may be issued. No CD's or hard copies will be available. Offerors are responsible for checking the referenced page for any update(s) to the Notice. The Government is not responsible for any loss of Internet connectivity or for an offeror's inability to access the document posted at the referenced website. <br>  <br> Summary of Work:  <br> The purpose and goal of this contract is to radio-track adult lamprey through the lower Snake River dams to determine behavior, passage routes and success, and conversion during upstream migration. <br>  <br> Fish counts, radio-telemetry (RT), and half-duplex PIT (HDX-PIT) tagging studies have documented the low number of adult lamprey migrating into the lower Snake River and through the FCRPS Projects.  Conversion rates of adult lamprey migrating through these Projects have not been determined and passage efficiencies have not been investigated since 2006.  Many minor ladder improvements have been made since 2006 to improve passage conditions for lamprey including, but not limited to:  a) lamprey orifice passage, b) ramps to elevated salmon orifices and c) diffuser grating plating.  There may be other areas within the ladders that can be improved.  Study results will be used to inform future fishway entrance improvements and areas within the ladders that cause migration delay or turn around.  Comparison of post-modification passage behavior with pre-modification behavior is used to evaluate success of modifications and to inform future designs and prioritization actions. <br>  <br> To successfully complete the study several tasks will be required of the contractor to include; collecting and tagging Adult Lamprey for Radio-Telemetry Study, installing, tuning and maintaining /repair radio-tracking antenna and receiver systems for determining entrance preference, ladder passage timing, assessing fallback and re-ascension routes, using all available tagged lamprey estimate adult lamprey upstream passage success rates, relative fishway route use, passage times, fallback rates and conversion rates from project to project as well as providing periodic written reports documenting status of the study and submission of a final report upon completion of the study.   <br> Tasks will be completed at four project sites within the US Army Corps of Engineers Walla Walla District.  Each of the following project locations are located along the Snake River:  Ice Harbor Dam, Lower Monumental Dam, Little Goose Dam and Lower Granite Dam.  <br>  <br> Set-aside status: The solicitation is scheduled to be issued 100% Small Business. <br>  <br> Conducting Business with the Government: <br> In order for contractors to conduct business with the Department of Defense, the contractor must provide registration information to the System for Award Management (SAM). All Offerors must be SAM registered prior to receiving an award. Registration instructions may be obtained, and online registration may be accomplished, at www.sam.gov.

<DESC>It is the Government's intent to issue an eighteen (18) month extension to contract W81K04-11-C-0006 on a sole-source basis to the American Registry of Pathology, a non-profit organization, to allow for continuation of services without degradation or disruption.   Please note that we have now determined that two or more small business are identified as viable candidates who possess the capability to compete competitively to support a follow-on five year non-commercial services contract based upon the results of extensive market research conducted over the last twelve (12) months.   This research is documented in the attached market research report and non-commerciality determination document.   However, due to the AFMES mission critical unique personnel laboratory certification requirements and personnel security requirements, a minimum six (6) months is required for an overlap of personnel support services between contracts.   The acquisition strategy for the planned competitively awarded small business set aside, follow-on five (5) year contract supports an award date of 30 March 2015 with a six month transition in period overlapping with this bridge contract.  The planned six month overlap will allow for adequate time to obtain requisite contractor personnel laboratory certifications and security clearances.

<DESC>&nbsp; This is a RFI notice only. This RFI is issued for the purpose of market research in accordance with FAR Part 10.
<p>The 99th Contracting Squadron is seeking market information from qualified, experienced and interested contractors who can perform tasks in support of the 414th Combat Training Squadron. This support shall cover all training and testing operations which utilize the Nellis Air Combat Training System (NACTS)/Individual Combat Aircrew Display System (ICADS) and operations with the Combined Air Operations Center? Nellis (CAOC-N). These operations include but are not limited to RED FLAG (RF) exercises, USAF Weapons School Mission Employment (ME) phase, Joint Expeditionary Forces Experiment (JEFX), ANGEL THUNDER and other special training/testing missions. RF exercises, conducted at Nellis AFB, NV, provide Large Force Exercise (LFE) advanced tactical training for multinational forces. RF exercises are typically conducted five times per year, are two weeks long, contain two missions per day (normally one day and one night "go") and comprise 500 to 1500 sorties. For both exercises, separate morning, afternoon and nighttime operations may be conducted during any particular period. An Air Tasking Order (ATO) is published for each exercise day that directs the missions, objectives and targets for each unit as part of the integrated force. During execution, mission data is transmitted live and recorded from exercise aircraft/equipment, and received/processed by the Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR) computer systems for real-time mission control and use in mission debriefings. Recorded data will require post-mission merging. Post-mission, the contractor will generate several aircrew debriefing products to include: graphic flight path tracks for each aircraft; weapons employment "shot" evaluations (air-to-air, air-to-ground, ground-to-air shot and Electronic Warfare (EW)); survivability analysis; aggressor tactics and other related data. In support of these exercises, the 68th Electronic Warfare Squadron (68 EWS) at Eglin AFB, FL is tasked by Air Combat Command (ACC) through the USAF Warfare Center (USAFWC) to be the focal point to manage EW training, testing, tactics development and engineering. The 68 EWS provides specialized expertise and assistance in conducting EW/Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (C3I) operations during composite force training exercises at Nellis AFB, NV. During each exercise the contractor shall support aircrew package debriefs (normally two to three) and a mass aircrew debrief for every mission. Debrief data for both RF and other exercises will be input into and maintained in a database to allow analysis of aggregate historical data concerning the capabilities and strategies utilized in tactical air operations. The contractor shall provide data retrievals as requested by the 414 CTS staff to support any requests within the scope of the contract.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />1. Request interested firms respond to the following.</p>
<p>a. Identify your firm's information (name, address, phone number, CAGE code).<br />b. Identify if your company is a large or small business. If applicable, identify what small business program(s) (i.e. SBA Certified 8(a), Service Disabled Veteran Owned), Hub zone, etc. your company is certified as. <br />c. Identify the appropriate amount of calendar days required to respond to an RFP.<br />d. What is the timeframe needed from time of award to transition and begin new service.<br />e. What type of contract vehicle would you be using (GSA, SEWP or Open Market, etc.)?<br />f. Any other comments, feedback or response on how to improve this requirement is highly encouraged.</p>
<p>2. Responses are to be submitted to the primary point of contact, Stephen Colton, at Stephen.Colton@us.af.mil or Attn: Stephen Colton, 5865 Swaab Blvd. Bldg. 588, Nellis AFB 89191 no later than Monday&nbsp;24 March, 4:00 pm Pacific Time. Earlier submission is highly encouraged.</p>
<p>3. This RFI notice is issued for planning purposes only. Responses to this notice will assist the Government in identifying potential sources and determining if a set-aside of the solicitation is appropriate. This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract, nor does it obligate the Government to pay for any bid/proposal preparation costs.</p>
<p>4. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact the Contract Specialist, Mr. Stephen Colton, at (702) 652-5488.</p>

<p><br />RFI Questions</p>
<p>Experience<br />In 500 words or less, please briefly describe your company's core competencies.</p>
<p>1) Do you currently, or have you in the past 10 years, provided COMBS support?<br />a) What are/were the number &amp; type of aircraft and at what locations?</p>
<p>2) Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS) issues will likely occur during this effort: <br />a) Identify, specify and name experiences with DMSMS<br />b) Identify and specify unique capabilities or business relationships with suppliers and OEMs to address DMSMS issues?</p>
<p>Acquisition Strategy</p>
<p>1) We are contemplating awarding between a five (5) and eight (8) year contract.<br />a) Can you accurately reflect your costs for that Period of Performance? <br />b) What are advantages/disadvantages do you realize regarding this length of contract?<br />c) How long is your typical contractual arrangement with vendors/subcontractors and would you be able to maintain those agreements for this length of time?</p>
<p>2) What length of transition between outgoing &amp; incoming contractors would most benefit successful performance: 30, 60, 90, 120 or 150 days?</p>
<p>3) What types of incentives (i.e. option periods, cost savings incentives, award fee, etc...) would most motivate your company? <br />a) Are there incentives that would motivate you to offer continuous supply rate improvements while driving down cost?</p>
<p>4) What advantages and/or disadvantages do you perceive would be obtained by using:<br />a) FAR Part 12 contract? <br />b) FAR Part 15 contract?</p>
<p>5) Do you have a preference to using a "C" or "D" type contract? Please explain your answer. <br />a) Is there a preference to using Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Task Orders on the contract?</p>

<p>7) Is your company familiar with the USG processes of contracting, billing, engineering, etc...?</p>
<p>8) What do you perceive are the pros and cons of including liquidated damage penalties that are tied to aircraft availability?</p>
<p>9) Detail past teaming arrangements, i.e., partnering, joint ventures, etc... with small businesses</p>
<p>10) Describe and detail subcontracting opportunities by function &amp; percentage of contract<br />a) What function and/or what percentage of set-aside would you deem most advantageous to this effort?<br />b) What teaming arrangements (if any) can be established to help develop small business for this effort?</p>
<p>11) Do you believe this effort could be a total small business set-aside?</p>
<p><br />Market Research<br />In an effort to optimize flexibility within COMBS services contracts, the USG is exploring pricing variable levels of support in order to adjust required levels of support as needed without driving costs or significantly increasing risk to either the USG or the contractor. We would like candid feedback to the following possible contract options and any additional ideas the respondent may have to increase contract flexibility.</p>
<p>1) Do you have capability to price incremental levels of supply support? For example, are you able to price separate flying hour rates for a Total Non-Mission Capable Supply (TNMCS) rate between 2% and 10%? (TNMCS includes both NMCS &amp; NMCB times) <br />a) Would there be a significant price difference between increments? <br />b) At what increment(s) would the USG see the greatest price difference? <br />c) Do you foresee additional risks of pricing different levels of TNMCS support?<br />i) Please briefly explain any risks.<br />d) In your opinion, would the overall contract price increase, decrease, or remain the same if an incremental pricing structure was established versus pricing to support a single TNMCS rate?</p>
<p>2) Would it be difficult to adjust your level of support at the beginning of each FY or Period of Performance based on a change in the required TNMCS rate?</p>
<p>3) Do you have other recommendations for making a supply support contract more flexible?</p>
<p>Additional Information</p>
<p>1) What are your recommendations and/or concerns with this source selection?<br />a) Do you have other recommendations/approaches that would result in successful contract performance?</p>
<p>Provide any additional closing comments you would like.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Education (the Department) is conducting market research for a new Fiscal Year (FY) 2014 requirement titled An Impact Evaluation of the Teacher Incentive Fund (TIF) program. This Request for Information (RFI) is being used to determine if sufficient interest and capability exists regarding this potential future solicitation. This notice is provided as information to the marketplace, and is an invitation for interested parties to express interest and provide information regarding their relevant capabilities. Disclaimer: This notice is NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract to any respondent. The Department will not be responsible for any costs incurred in responding to this notice, nor compensate respondents for the provision of any information submitted in response to this notice.<br /> <br />The Department&rsquo;s Institute of Education Sciences (IES) has a requirement to continue an impact evaluation of the Teacher Incentive Fund (TIF) program currently being conducted under contract ED-04-CO-0112/0012.  This new, anticipated contract will extend the evaluation effort to include data collection for the final year of the 2010 TIF grant program implementation (school year 2014-15) and two reports (one based on the 2014-15 data collection and one based on 2013-14 data collected in contract ED-04-CO-0112/0012).    The TIF grants included in the evaluation were awarded in 2010.  The grants are five years long.  Typically the grants include a planning period during the first year of the grant in order to meet grant requirements for implementation.  The remaining four years of the grant include implementation of a performance based compensation system.  IES intends for the evaluation of the 2010 TIF grant program to include impacts and implementation information from all four implementation years (school years 2011-12 through 2014-15, years 2-5 of the grant).  Currently the initial stages of the evaluation effort are conducted through contract ED-04-CO-0112/0012 and include three years of data collection (school years 2011-12 through 2013-14, years 2-4 of the grant) and two reports covering information from school years 2011-12 and 2012-13. The existing contract, ED-04-CO-0112/0012, cannot be extended to include a report based on the school year 2013-14 data collection, data collection during school 2014-15, and a report based on school year 2014-15.<br /> <br />The Department is specifically interested in receiving capability statements from small businesses in the HUBZone and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned subcategories.  However, all vendors, including large businesses are encouraged to submit capability statements or comments. The Department seeks information on the extent to which there are small and large businesses that possess the necessary capabilities (See Attachment B &ndash; TIF Capability Statement and Vendor Feedback Instructions) to complete the required work outlined in the Draft TIF Performance Work Statement (TIF DRAFT PWS &ndash; Attachment A).  Vendors are not required to submit a capability statement in order to submit a proposal for the anticipated, subsequent Request for Proposals (RFP) for the subject requirement.  <br /><br />All questions, feedback, and Capability Statements must be submitted to the Contract Specialist Natasha Boyce (Natasha.Boyce@ed.gov), with a cc: to the Contracting Officer, Veronica Price (Veronica.Price@ed.gov), in writing, no later than Tuesday, March 25, 2014, at 12:00 noon EST. <br /> <br />Question and Response Protocol: A consolidated list of all questions and responses to all properly-submitted questions will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities Website (www.fbo.gov) no later than Thursday, March 27, 2014, as an addendum to this notice.

<DESC>The NASA Langley Research Center is planning to re-compete the Structures, Materials, Aerodynamics, Aerothermodynamics and Acoustics Research Technology (SMAAART) contracts, and is seeking broad community input for the follow-on procurement.	It is anticipated the follow-on to SMAAART will cover the same broad range of work, in addition to new technical content.  The objective of this RFI is to obtain feedback from industry participants to aid in the development of the Governments requirements and/or the sourcing strategy for the follow-on effort.  The scope of the follow-on activity is anticipated to include the technical areas identified in Attachment 1.	 <p> Respondents are invited to provide comments on the content of this announcement, including suggestions for improving the scope of the follow-on contract to ensure every effort is made to adequately address the technical areas.  Specifically, the Government is requesting responses to the following questions: <p> 1.	Is there any technical language within the Technical Area descriptions that you find unclear? 2.	Is the description under each Technical Area comprehensive and complete? 3.	Are there technical applications or disciplines described in one Technical Area which you believe are better suited under another Technical Area? 4.	Are there any emerging technologies that are related to a broad Technical Area, but do not appear to be adequately addressed within its description? 5.	Is there specific technical language within a Technical Area which might: a.	Preclude your company from proposing? b.	Require significant/excessive subcontracting or partnering? 6.	If your company had the ability to bid individual Technical Areas or groups of Technical Areas, would it increase the likelihood of your company submitting a proposal? What grouping of Technical Areas would best fit your companys capabilities? 7.	Additional feedback regarding the technical areas described in Attachment 1. <p> All responses should be submitted in PDF or Word format to Bobbi Forbes via electronic transmission (bobbi.forbes@nasa.gov) by March 26, 2014.  Responses shall be no more than five (5) letter-sized pages in length, with font Times New Roman 12.

Proprietary and export controlled information should be marked appropriately in your response to the RFI. Respondents are advised that NASA is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted under this RFI.  NASA may contact respondents to this RFI if clarifications or additional information is desired.  <p> Documents related to this RFI and any follow-on procurement will be available over the Internet.

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice.  This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.  The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.
<p>THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  THIS IS STRICTLY FOR MARKET RESEARCH.</p>
<p>Background<br />The Radiation Epidemiology Branch (REB) in the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) is re-competing a full and open contract for support services for several on going studies, feasibility studies, and future studies.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives<br />A major objective of DCEG is to identify and understand mechanisms of carcinogenesis.  Studies within REB focus on cancer risk and other health outcomes associated with medical, occupational or environmental exposure to radiation as well as the etiology of certain cancers associated with radiation exposure (e.g. thyroid, breast, leukemia) and the radiation dosimetry to assess the cancer risks under investigation.</p>
<p>To achieve its goals, REB's approach has been to conduct high-impact epidemiologic studies that integrate cancer risk factor information, carefully defined radiation exposure assessments, and sometimes biologic markers to provide new insights into radiation carcinogenesis.  Molecular approaches play a critical and increasingly important role in REB research. REB is often called upon to address rapidly emerging issues in radiation exposure and cancer epidemiology through novel investigations and data sources. REB also assists in training the next generation of radiation epidemiologists, statisticians, and applied radiation dosimetrists. Approximately 12-30 studies in various phases will require support at any one time under the contract.</p>
<p>Project Requirements<br />This support services contract is essential for REB to conduct high-impact epidemiologic studies that integrate radiation exposure, cancer risk factor information, and at times biologic markers to provide new insights into cancer etiology and mechanisms of action. The NCI/DCEG/REB requires the assistance of an organization highly experienced in providing technical support for all phases of epidemiologic studies, including support for pilot and feasibility efforts to assess capabilities for launching multidisciplinary studies, development of precise methods of defining radiation dose for the purposes of identifying new causes of cancer and to adequately characterize the shape of the dose-response relationship, and to understand the interaction of genetic, radiation, and other risk factors related to cancer risk.  Thus, the support services contract will need to provide staff with superb logistical skills, knowledge of and experience conducting epidemiological studies and collection of biological specimens.  The contract will establish a mechanism to provide all the services required to conduct a wide variety of domestic and international (case-control, cohort, cross-sectional, and pilot) epidemiologic studies.</p>
<p>The scientific design and oversight of the activities are the responsibility of the REB professional staff.  Some of the major activities of the contractor include:  <br />1) Obtain necessary information to determine effective study resources (e.g., capabilities of collaborating institutions, numbers of eligible study subjects, exposure information, etc.) and prepare, pretest, evaluate and produce data collection forms and specification manuals, including computer-assisted questionnaires; <br />2) Provide project management and assist in the coordination of multi-center studies and facilitate cooperation between NCI and its collaborators; <br />3) Prepare training programs and materials for abstractors, interviewers and other study personnel and procedure manuals; <br />4) Arrange for the collection, handling, processing, transport and storage of biologic samples or to send them to specific laboratories as directed; <br />5) Validate cancer incidence and cause of death by performing registry linkages (e.g., linkage with cancer registries), conducting NDI+ searches, and obtaining medical records, and have them coded by appropriate nosologists, pathologists or clinicians; <br />6) Collect, code, and key data from medical and radiation records; <br />7) Trace study subjects to locate them for interview or biologic specimen collection, to determine their vital status, and obtain other information necessary for the study with the understanding that some of the subjects were last contacted years ago; <br />8) Hire, train and supervise abstractors, interviewers, telephone screeners, coders, phlebotomists and others who will be involved with acquiring and assembling data; abstract, scan, photocopy or obtain records (clinical or office medical records, hospital charts, pathology reports, radiation treatment records etc.); <br />9) Interview subjects or surrogates using mail, telephone, computer-assisted or personal interviews; <br />10) Assist in evaluating the feasibility of integrating specific molecular components into planned epidemiologic studies; <br />11) Act as a liaison for collection of radiation exposure records and arrange for estimation of radiation doses as needed; <br />12) Arrange for laboratory evaluation of biologic material; <br />13) Enter coded information into electronic databases; <br />14) Design and maintain computer databases and associated reporting software and prepare edit programs, edit data, maintain quality control, and correct computer files where necessary; prepare analytical data files and maintain version control of files as requested by the REB staff; <br />15) Document each step of a study, including decision logs, and maintain in an orderly arrangement all relevant material so that any aspect of the study may be reviewed and evaluated by the REB staff at any point in time; <br />16) Develop and manage subcontracts for conducting epidemiologic and radiation dosimetry studies inside and outside the U.S., for specialized field procedures in the U.S., and for laboratory analyses of biologic samples.  <br />17) Provide the support necessary to make dose measurements using soil, archived tissues, milk, teeth, blood, human-like phantoms, computerized treatment planning programs or specialized software, as appropriate, to reconstruct radiation doses to specific organs (or sites within organs) following natural, environmental, man-made, or therapeutic and diagnostic medical exposures for ongoing epidemiologic studies.</p>
<p>Anticipated period of performance<br />It is anticipated that the period of performance for this Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract will be for 5-years with two 1-year options.</p>
<p>Capability statement/Information sought<br />To be deemed capable of providing the requirement, organizations shall submit a written capability statement demonstrating ability and experience in performing the requirements noted in this notice.  Organizations must demonstrate experience, capabilities, qualified personnel, and expertise in (1) managing, planning and conducting multiple small and large epidemiologic projects in widespread geographic areas (including internationally), some of which involve molecular or international components; (2) collecting radiotherapy records and assisting the resolution of deficiencies and problems, and collecting and transporting biological and environmental samples; (3) training abstractors and interviewers in other aspects of field studies such as obtaining medical records and death certificates; (4) constructing analytic data files using SAS or other similar statistical programs for epidemiologic studies and manipulating large data sets; (5) providing adequate staffing to provide support on multiple studies, at different stages in the studies, worldwide; (6) quality control/quality assurance plans for epidemiologic and radiotherapy data, biospecimen, and environmental sample management and security of data; (7) assist in coordination of biologic or environmental specimen collection, handling and transport to a repository for storage; and (8) providing capable, suitable, adequate, and available facilities, equipment, and other resources necessary to carry out the requirements.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) in accordance with FAR 15.201(e).  The agency does not intend to award a contract but rather gather capabilities and market information pertinent for acquisition planning.  The responses to this RFI will contribute to the development of either a Request for Quotes (RFQ) utilizing the appropriate GSA Federal Supply Schedule, or Request for Proposals (RFP).

BACKGROUND of VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION HOMELESS PROGRAM OFFICE

The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has made ending Veteran homelessness a top priority, undertaking an unprecedented campaign to dramatically increase resources as well as awareness of VA services available for homeless Veterans and Veterans at risk of homelessness. While permanent, stable housing is the benchmark of these efforts, housing alone may not be sufficient to mitigate a current episode of homelessness or prevent future episodes. Employment is also a key element in helping Veterans climb out of homelessness permanently or avoid it all together.  Employment provides an improved quality of life, increased self-confidence and independence, opportunities for socialization and a decreased reliance on institutional care.  Research has shown that employment is also likely to result in decreases in substance use and improvements in mental health.  Conversely, unemployment increases the likelihood of isolation, social withdrawal and disengagement from the community.  As part of its Plan to End Homelessness Among Veterans, VA seeks to increase the emphasis on competitive employment as a strategy for preventing homelessness and sustaining permanent housing and to insure that a full range of employment services is available to all homeless, chronically homeless and at-risk Veterans. The Homeless Program Office will emphasize Employment and Permanent Housing as equally important to ending and preventing Veteran homelessness.


PURPOSE OF THIS REQUIREMENT

Contractor staff will be identified to perform education and training across the homeless continuum, supported by targeted, time-limited mentoring to newly hired VHA Community Employment Coordinators (CEC) at approximately 160 medical center sites over an initial 12 month period.

<DESC>Pursuant to FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b)(1), the Navajo Area Indian Health Services/NNMC, intends to pursue a sole source acquisition with Johns Hopkins Center for American Indian Health, 615 N. Wolfe Street, Baltimore, MD 21218-2680 to provide Research on obesity and Diabetes among Navajo Youth services for the&nbsp;Navajo Area Diabetes Program, Shiprock, NM&nbsp; 87420.<br />&nbsp;<br />1. Scope<br />a. Background<br />Despite ever-increasing, alarming rates of obesity and diabetes among Navajo youth, there is a complete lack of evidence-based, culturally appropriate interventions and educational materials for youth. (Approximately 14% of all Chinle students meet the high risk criteria for obesity/diabetes prevention intervention).
<p>The Chinle Service Unit's Diabetes, Public Health and Health Promotion Programs saw this need for diabetes and obesity prevention programs for youth. Chinle has a proven track record using the Health Coach Model and they have the staff available to implement a prevention program for youth. However, for an effective prevention program, a culturally and age-appropriate obesity and diabetes prevention "tool kit" training for the coaches are needed.</p>
<p>The Johns Hopkins Center for American Indian Health has a long history of successfully implementing public health programs in partnership with the Indian Health Service within Navajo Area. Johns Hopkins is also unique, as it is has the only program (Together on Diabetes) operating in Navajo Area with a focus on diabetes and youth. Together on Diabetes has conducted in-depth assessments of the needs of Navajo youth at high risk for diabetes and are developing and evaluating prevention/education strategies that are effective and culturally appropriate for this population. Johns Hopkins also has the expert staff and experience developing tools that staff can use to help youth make lifestyle changes (including preparation of an evaluation component).</p>
<p>b. Purpose<br />Goal: To create a high-impact, sustainable initiative to prevent obesity, diabetes and related consequences by promoting healthy, productive lifestyles for Navajo youth ages 10-19, beginning in the Chinle Service Unit.</p>
<p>2. Requirements:</p>
<p>a. Tasks</p>
<p>To achieve this goal, Johns Hopkins Center for American Indian Health will partner with Chinle Service Unit to accomplish the following aims in several phases:</p>
<p>Months 1 to 6:</p>
<p>1. Formative Development: Roundtables and interviews with youth and relevant stakeholders <br />2. Formation of a Community Advisory Board<br />3. Identify youth's structural, physical, social, emotional and cultural facilitators and barriers to healthy lifestyles related to obesity and diabetes<br />4. Youth's preference for type of educator, setting, format, style and content for the behavior change promotion <br />5. Target age-group intervention (ages 10-14 and 15-19)<br />6. Youth's current recreation, communication, cultural preferences and inspirational and aspirational touch points (i.e. sports, art, social media choices, role models, brands, hopes/desires for the future)<br />7. Capturing youth's ideas for program name, logo, slogans and taglines, including key words, graphics and symbols.<br />8. Environmental strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) analysis to determine which settings (e.g. schools, health/human services agencies and clinics, community groups); tribal/community policies; and cultural and community resources can be additionally engaged to support he healthy behavioral lifestyle changes</p>
<p>Months 3 to 12:<br />Program Development:<br />a. Program development will be based on information gained through the formative development phase (Months 1 to 3) and will include the adaptation of the currently existing Together on Diabetes materials. Lessons will focus on promoting healthy lifestyles to prevent obesity and diabetes, and life skills training to promote emotional and mental well-being. The Navajo wellness model will be incorporated into the educational materials. We will learn through the formative phase whether these lessons should be: 1) group-based or one-on-one, and 2) taught in school, at home or in a clinical setting, or a hybrid of all three in order to engage key structural support systems for the youth (e.g. teachers, family, health care providers) and will adapt the Together on Diabetes materials accordingly. <br />b. We will work with the target population (youth, family, healthcare providers, school personnel) and Chinle program leadership to review and edit the first drafts of the materials. <br />1. Development of Evaluation Plan:<br />a. Johns Hopkins will provide the Chinle team with a proposed evaluation plan for the program. The evaluation plan will consist of both process and outcome measures and individual and community outcome measures. Findings from the existing Together on Diabetes program will be helpful when developing this evaluation plan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;2. Development of Competency Checklist:<br />a. Key lifestyle coach competencies will include but are not limited to knowledge of the training materials/content, cultural competence, protocol delivery, teaching and behavioral motivational skills, quality of rapport/relationship-building with participating youth, communication skills, and professional conduct (including boundary setting). These competencies will be assessed via knowledge assessments, lesson observations and teach-backs using a competency checklist.</p>
<p>Months 12 to 18:<br />1. Training of Lifestyle Coaches:<br />a. Johns Hopkins will conduct the initial training of Lifestyle Coaches, along with the Chinle leadership during months 12-13 of the grant period. <br />2. Certification of Lifestyle Coaches:<br />a. The competency checklist will be utilized to ensure lifestyle coaches have mastered the requisite skills.<br />3. Initial implementation of the program:<br />a. Chinle lifestyle coaches will implement the educational materials with youth in the service area. The Johns Hopkins team will provide TA during this implementation period through bi-weekly (2 months), then monthly (4 months) conference calls.</p>

<SUBJECT>Request for Information - BMDS Sensor Study
<SOLNBR>SENSORS-DE-2014-0001
<RESPDATE>040114
<ARCHDATE>04032014
<CONTACT>John Crawford, Primary Technical POC, Phone (256) 450-5256, Email John.Crawford@mda.mil - Anna Lanz, Alternate Technical POC, Phone (256) 955-4021, Email anna.lanz@mda.mil
<DESC>1. Objective
<p>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is conducting market research to assist in the identification of potential discriminating sensor options, architectural innovations, and lessons learned that could be applied to the future BMDS sensor network. MDA is evaluating future tracking and discriminating sensor and sensor architecture options that would result in BMDS performance improvements in a cost-effective, operationally effective, timely, and affordable manner. The following architectural principles will guide MDA's sensor architecture roadmap:<br /><br />A. Maximum exploitation of non-BMD assets for BMD applications<br />B. Cost-effective investment strategies that deploy capabilities incrementally<br />C. Creation and preservation of decision support information throughout the kill chain <br />D. Maximum exploitability of BMD sensor assets and processing for non-BMD applications<br />E. No dead-end engineering that blocks extension to evolving threats and countermeasures</p>
<p>The focus of this Request for Information (RFI) is on recommended options that are presented in the context of an overall mixed sensor architecture, potentially consisting of land, sea, airborne and space elements with allocated responsibilities. The government will use industry's technical responses to inform future sensor architecture planning and technology development investments. This RFI does not constitute a Request for Proposal and the Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI. As a result, potential responders should not construe there is any commitment on the part of the Government that there will be a follow-on acquisition action that will be linked in some manner to this RFI.</p>
<p>Participation in this market research on the part of a potential responder is strictly voluntary and in ac-cordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.215-3, Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes. The Government will not pay for the information solicited or any costs that are in-curred as a result of this Special Notice, to include participant costs associated with attending the Industry Day discussed in Section 5, or any costs that are incurred by a participant who elects to provide Information in response to this RFI, except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18 of the FAR.</p>
<p>2. Background</p>
<p>The mission of the MDA is to "defend the US, deployed forces, allies, and friends from ballistic missile attack of all ranges in all phases of flight." To accomplish this mission, the MDA has fielded a Ballistic Missile Defense System architecture, consisting of weapons, sensors and integrating functions, that engages short, medium, intermediate, and long-range ballistic missile threats in the post boost phases of flight. The BMDS presently relies upon land-and-sea-based radars - supplemented by Overhead Persistent Infrared (OPIR) boost phase tracking sensors for early warning and cueing - to develop feasible fire control solutions. The Program of Record sensor network will be evolved to provide tracking, discrimination and kill assessment enhancements.</p>
<p>3. Desired Information</p>
<p>MDA is requesting industry inputs related to architectural constructs and approaches that might be incorporated into a future BMDS. Where necessary, details should be provided in a classified annex as described in Section 4, Responses. Additional details to support the development of the responses are included in a classified annex as described in Section 6, Classified Attachment. Inputs should relate to one or more the following functional upgrades:</p>
<p>A. Improved raid size capacity and reduced ambiguity in the handover from boost to post-boost tracking. Raid size capacity can be defined as the number of warheads that the BMDS can engage for specified engagement scenarios<br />B. Improved debris rejection to reduce confusion and sensor workload<br />C. Improved post boost track resolution and track accuracy to widen battlespace, to maintain custody of decision support information across the kill chain, and to promote discrimination<br />D. Reduced inferential distance between observables and target object properties<br />E. Improved warhead classification to assist in shot prioritization and inventory management<br />F. Enhanced Kill Assessment capabilities to promote efficient shot doctrine<br />G. Improved resistance to technical and tactical countermeasures<br />H. Maturity sufficient to deliver operational capability in the 2020 to 2025 timeframe.</p>
<p>The following information should be included in your response:</p>
<p>&nbsp; 1. Description: A text description of the key attributes of the concept or&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;approach being suggested.<br />&nbsp; 2. Cost: A Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost estimate broken out by life<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;cycle phase for concepts, and, where applicable, an assessment of<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;affordability improvements for approach(s).<br />&nbsp; 3. Schedule: An estimated schedule for Research, Development, Test, and<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Evaluation (RDT&amp;E), integration, procurement, and fielding.<br />&nbsp; 4. Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and Risk Assessment (where applicable):<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Overall TRL and associated readiness date, with substantiating evidence<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. TRL of major system components and interfaces, with substantiating<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;evidence <br />&nbsp; 5. System Considerations (where applicable). Include a description of system<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;dependencies in the areas of:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Sensor capability against ballistic missiles in all phases of flight (boost, mid-<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; course, and terminal).<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Command and Control, Battle Management and Communications<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C2BMC)/Integration approach addressing integration issues for the&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sensor(s), weapons(s) and platform(s) into the BMDS. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Identify potential fielding concepts and impacts to logistics. (where<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;applicable)<br />&nbsp; 6. Potential for multi-mission applicability.</p>

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Award-Brand Name Specific Application The National Park Service, Natural Sounds and Night Skies Division (NSNSD), intends to award a firm fixed-price purchase order to Wildlife Acoustics Inc., 970 Sunbury Rd., Concord, MA  01742-4939.
The purpose of this order is for the supply and delivery of thirteen (13) SM2Bat+ ultrasonic bat recorders. Market research concluded that Wildlife Acoustics, Inc. is the only producer of ultrasonic bat detectors which meet the needs for compatibility with SonoBat Software, low power consumption, and large storage capacity.  Additionally, NSNSD recently purchased a number of SM2Bat+ recorders, and has developed software and hardware accessories for these units.  Procurement of non-compatible recorders will provide the best continuity and function for NSNSD, which has already invested time and resources into the operation of these units.  Award to any other source at this time would result in duplication of time and cost retraining NSNSD staff and partners, and re-engineering hardware and software products that NSNSD has developed for use with the SM2Bat+ recorders.  The NAICS code is 334310 and the size standard is 750; the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (a) (1) and 6.302-1(c).
The magnitude of this purchase order is estimated to be $13,000. Award shall be made on or about March 28, 2014, however the Government reserves the right to change this date. No telephone or fax inquiries will be accepted, e-mails may be submitted to the following e-mail address: stephanie_lawrence@contractor.nps.gov . This is a notice of intent and not a request for competitive proposals. No solicitation is available for this requirement. Interested parties should submit a capability statement and pricing information within fifteen calendar days of publication of this notice, to be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive requirement.
The following FAR clauses are applicable to this award: 52.212-1, 52.212-3, 52.212-4, 52.212-5, 52.223-18, 52.232-40, 52.252-2, and 6.302-1.

<DESC>A. INTRODUCTION
The Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) will be hosting quarterly Joint Interagency Field Exploration (JIFX) events throughout the 2014 fiscal year (FY14). These events will focus on exploring the potential of new capabilities to address challenges faced by the United Statesâ€™ Combatant Commanders (AFRICOM, CENTCOM, EUCOM, NORTHCOM, PACOM, SOCOM, SOUTHCOM,
STRATCOM, TRANSCOM) and the federal entities that support (or are supported by) the COCOMs. The Department of
Defense and the Department of Homeland Security are the sponsoring entities for this event. This event is modeled on the successful US Special Operations Command â€“ Naval Postgraduate Schoolâ€™s TNT/CBE events and is being conducted to provide the benefits of a multi institutional semi-structured learning environment for the conventional forces community.
 Companies, educational institutions, laboratories and other organizations are invited to submit white papers that may lead to an invitation to
participate in the August JIFX event to be conducted at the NPS McMillan Airfield facility on Camp Roberts near Paso Robles, California.

B. OBJECTIVES
(1) Background: NPS will conduct JIFX events in cooperation with S&T and operational representatives from each of the
Unified Combatant Commands (COCOMs), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and interagency partners 4 times in
FY14. This cooperative JIFX event will be conducted with representatives from Government R&D organizations, academia,
private industry and non-government/non-profit organizations.
 JIFX events provide an opportunity for technology developers to
interact with operational personnel to determine how their technology development efforts and ideas may support or enhance
USG/DoD/DHS capability needs. The environment facilitates a collaborative working relationship between Government,
academia, industry and NGOs to promote the identification and assessment of emerging and maturing technologies with the primary goal of accelerating the delivery of enhanced capabilities to the end user. These events enable the identification of key performance attributes and parameters, associated with the development of new technologies, which can inform future
acquisition activities.

(2) Event Focus: The overall focus of JIFX will be to explore technologies that have the potential of rapidly increasing military and first responder capability, reducing the cost of current capabilities, providing options for reducing force structure associated
with a capability, or providing a means to work and share more with partner nations and other organizations.
General areas of interest for JIFX include:
Command, Control, Communication, Computers / Situational Awareness (C4/SA) Ù  Intelligence, Surveillance, and
Reconnaissance (ISR) Ù  Cyber Security / Computer Network Security Ù  Information Sharing Ù  Crowdsourcing Tools
Ù Transportation Logistics; Biometric Collection and Sharing Systems Ù  Electronic Warfare Ù  Combating Weapons of Mass
Destruction Ù  Irregular Warfare Ù  Aircraft and Helicopter Survivability Ù  Energy Systems Ù  Humanitarian Assistance & Disaster Relief Ù  and other technologies that address a current or anticipated operational need.

Other Special Requirements: DO NOT SUBMIT PROPOSALS.
 SUBMIT TECHNOLOGY EXPLORATION WHITE PAPERS ONLY. White paper submission deadliness may be found on the JIFX website. No contracts will be awarded based on this announcement or any subsequent supplemental RFI announcements.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with IBM Corporation, located at 6710 Rockledge Drive, Bethesda, MD 20817, for the purchase of their Accelerated Value Program for Rational and WebSphere software. This procurement is being made in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or supplies or services will satisfy the agency?s requirements.
The Accelerated Value Program goes significantly beyond standard maintenance through dedicated access to IBM Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). These SMEs are available to the customer to assist with issues and problems both remotely and in person and support the initial implementation and follow on support of the Rational and WebSphere products. Due to the level of advice being provided by the SME?s, they will not only need to have access to the source code and IBM-specific technical knowledge, but will need to be able to directly access and coordinate within IBM?s support organization. IBM Rational and WebSphere tools are proprietary software licensed to SSA by IBM. 
THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION. This posting constitutes SSA?s notice of intent to negotiate on a sole source basis as described above. SSA does not intend to pay for any information received as a result of this notice. Interested parties that feel they can provide the services described above may respond by submitting their capability statement by email to rick.bolt@ssa.gov by 12:00 noon ET on March 21, 2014. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received SSA will proceed with sole source negotiations. Telephone calls regarding this matter will not be accepted, nor will they be returned.

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought Notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Nasogastric Tubes. This is not a request for quote or proposal. The MMESO Pacific is the lead MMESO for this project.</strong>
<p>These Nasogastric Tube products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.</p>
<p>This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2 for Nasogastric Tubes. All items proposed to be included in this QSL must be on Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. All participating vendors must complete the certification in the DAPA Management System (DMS). The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act Compliant Country (TAA) (as defined by FAR 52.225-5), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to complete the DAPA TAA Certification. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Bill Woltjen at DLA Troop Support, William.woltjen@dla.mil, 215-737-7124.</p>
<p>The QSL for Nasogastric Tubes will be established approximately August 2014 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. Qualified vendors will be invited approximately September 2014 to submit pricing proposals to enter into an Incentive Agreement for Nasogastric Tubes. The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Nasogastric Tubes.</p>
<p>A. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Nasogastric Tubing within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement. This product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $273,171.06. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. All ten product groupings were found to be relevant to the scope of this standardization action, and clinically significant product groups for the QSL. All ten items account for 100% ($273,171.06). The specifications for this project are shown in "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.</p>
<p>B. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must provide an e-mail response to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification to the lead MMESO POCs below.</strong> The vendor's responses must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. <br />As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL", vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Hawaii Standard Time (HST) on the date listed for closing in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the instant QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action. </strong></span></p>
<p>C. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection and coordinate logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The board is chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO Areas of Responsibility (AORs) and includes clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to review responses and evaluate products for selection to the QSL IAW FAR 9.2.</p>
<p>Requirements to Qualify for QSL<br />Nasogastric Tube requirements are outlined below. Complete answers and all supporting documentation must be provided with the vendor's submittal by the response date stated in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification. <strong>A vendor who does not meet all of these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements as requested will not be qualified for the QSL. Vendors must provide responses to this Sources Sought notification via the QSL FBO Package Worksheet.<br /></strong>1.

If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; Firm Fixed-Priced quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is NAMA-14-Q-0045 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-72 effective January 30, 2014. This is an unrestricted acquisition, issued in accordance with FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items. The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) intends to issue a contract(s) with firm fixed-priced contract line items (CLINs). EVALUATION: This is an unrestricted procurement, subject to Full and Open Competition. The Government reserves the right to issue multiple contracts, as well as, award on the initial quote without discussions of this procurement. Evaluation and award will be in accordance with the procedures of FAR 13.5 in conjunction with Subpart 13.106 Soliciting Competition, Evaluation of Quotations or Offers, Award and Documentation and in accordance with the guidance at FAR 12.301(c)(2). A contract will be issued to the Contractor(s) whose conforming quotation in response to the RFQ will be most advantageous to the Government. Best value for this procurement will be obtained through a lowest price technically acceptable evaluation. For evaluation purposes, the firm-fixed price for each CLIN will be determined by multiplying the Unit Price by the Quantity of units, and the total fixed price will be determined by summing the firm-fixed price of all CLINs. Contractors must provide pricing for each CLIN, including any Option CLINs. BACKGROUND: The purpose of this procurement is to purchase printers and installation, programming, testing, and training for the Research Room at the National Archives at College Park. REQUIREMENTS: See Attachment 1, Schedule of Prices. Contractors must submit their pricing (USD) in accordance with RFQ Attachment 1, Schedule of Prices. Contractors must complete and submit Attachment 2, RFQ Information Sheet. See Attachment 3, Performance Work Statement.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF FAR SUBPART 13.5 TEST PROGRAM FOR CERTAIN COMMERCIAL ITEMS<br /><br />This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-72.
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541690 with size standard of $14.0 Million.</p>
<p>The Government requires all contractors doing business with the government to be registered with the System for Award Management (SAM). For additional information and to register in SAM, please access the following website: https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/. Award will not be made to any contractor that is not registered in SAM.</p>
<p>This acquisition is being procured as 100% Small Business Set-Aside.</p>
<p><br />Responsible quoters shall provide pricing for the following line item:</p>
<p>LINE ITEM 0001: The Contractor shall provide all labor, materials, equipment, and services necessary for task 1, task 2, task 3 and task 4 below to develop and initiate an OMG procedure for testing BPMN 2 model interchange similar to the existing OMG procedure for UML and to translate OAGIS business scenarios into Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN).</p>
<p>LINE ITEM 0002: Travel Costs in accordance with Federal Travel Regulations, (Interested party shall provide Not to Exceed amount).All estimated cost for travel.<br />BACKGROUND<br />The Object Management Group (OMG) is a member-based not-for-profit open standards development organization (SDO) producing both general and domain-specific standards. The Business Modeling &amp; Integration (BMI) Domain Task Force, within OMG develops specifications of integrated models to support management of an enterprise. These specifications promote inter- and intra-enterprise integration and collaboration of people, systems, processes, and information across the enterprise, including business partners and customers.<br />The OMG Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is the most widely used standard for enterprise-level process models, including manufacturing enterprises. It provides a notation that is readily understandable by subject matter experts, including engineers, supports the modeling of all processes, including engineering and manufacturing processes, and is also in a form usable by computers, creating a standardized bridge for the gap between process design and implementation. Upon request from multiple countries, BPMN is in the process of becoming an ISO approved standard. As an ISO approved standard, BPMN will make an even faster progression into organizations around the world. As such BPMN standardize interchange will play a vital role in ensuring free open access to best of breed engineering process management support for American BPMN tools providers and users.<br />With the growing use of BPMN on significant real world projects involving large teams using many kinds of modeling tools, it is critical that interchange of BPMN models between tools be reliable and accurate. This is especially true for implementations of the recently-standardized second version of BPMN (BPMN 2), which contains major upgrades for models of processes within enterprises, and interactions between enterprises, such as supply chains.<br />The BPMN Model Interchange Working Group (MIWG) is an OMG recognized working group whose objective is to establish a publically available BPMN 2.0 test procedure and test suite. It builds on successful OMG procedures for tool vendors to demonstrate interchange among modeling tools for other OMG standards. These procedures will include interchange test cases that will be available on a public portal (http://www.omgwiki.org/bpmn-miwg). Participating vendors will prepare exports for each test case and import the exports from other tools to test interoperability. The vendors will publicly post exports from their tools for the test cases, enabling tool users to assess model interchange capability by comparing the vendor exports to the expected reference file for each test case. It is expected that interchange of BPMN models between some of the leading tools on the market will significantly improve as a direct result of resolving issues found during this testing procedure.<br />The first objective of this contract is to ensure tests for BPMN's descriptive capabilities go through the BPMN MIWG process. Part of ensuring completion of the process is to promote the use of the BPMN 2 interchange test suite and procedure among BPMN vendors and users.<br />The Open Applications Group (OAG) is a member-based not-for-profit open SDO focused on standards-based engineering enterprise process integration. The Open Applications Group Integration Specification (OAGIS) provides common message architecture for interoperability between disparate systems, companies, and supply chains. Business Scenarios are provided as a starting point for integration and complemented with Business Object Documents (BODs) for capturing messages or documents exchanged between software applications or components; between companies; across supply chains; and between supply chains. These include such scenarios as engineering to order and plant data management. The business scenarios are understandable by engineers, but are not in form usable by computers. This community is focused on building process-based business standards for Mobile Business, Cloud Computing, eCommerce, Application Integration, Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), and Web Services. OAGIS is a cross industry business standard, and the OAG Policy Board has insured that OAGIS is free to download and to use.<br />Potential benefits of integrating the Business Scenarios from OAGIS and the BPMN from OMG include more efficient and effective deployment of integrated processes across organizations. Separate engineering and business activities reduce efficiency of new product development by inhibiting communication between engineering departments and external stakeholders. Furthermore, these collaborations are not well defined or understood as integral parts of the overall business processes leading to sub-optimal engineering and overall management. This integration will lead to the availability of standardized Message Exchange Patterns (MEP) and Business Interaction Blueprints (BIB) in support of various industries. <br />The second objective of this contract is to translate OAGIS business scenarios into BPMN notation.<br />PURPOSE<br />The purposes of this acquisition are to develop test cases for BPMN 2.0 Descriptive Conformance capabilities, and to translate OAGIS business scenarios into BPMN notation.<br />TASKS <br />Required work shall be performed in collaboration with the National Institute of Standards and Technology as part of the Smart Manufacturing Operations Planning and Control program.<br />TASK 1: The Contractor shall develop test cases for BPMN's descriptive capabilities with the BPMN MIWG.<br />The contractor shall work in coordination with BPMN MIWG to develop tests of BPMN 2.0 Descriptive Conformance capabilities (see http://www.omgwiki.org/bpmn-miwg). This includes promoting the use of the BPMN 2 interchange test suite and procedure among BPMN vendors and end users. The contractor shall write two reports and one set of presentation slides on this work.<br />TASK 2: Give public demonstration of BPMN 2.0 descriptive capabilities tests.<br />The contractor shall give a public demonstration of BPMN 2.0 descriptive conformance tests to the BPMN MIWG during an OMG Technical Meeting (see http://www.omg.org/news/schedule/upcoming.htm). The contractor shall write one report on this work.</p>
<p>TASK 3: Develop BPMN models for OAGIS business scenarios<br />The Contractor shall develop public interface collaboration BPMN models for all business scenarios of the current version of OAGIS (see References section). These models shall be in BPMN 2 interchange file format, covering abstract and concrete syntax. The contractor shall write a report identifying problems in the BPMN and OAG specifications identified during this work.</p>
<p>TASK 4: Incorporate feedback from OMG and OAG into results of Task 3.<br />The Contractor shall discuss the deliverables of Task 3 with members of OMG and OAG to gather and incorporate feedback on the deliverables before they are finalized. The Contractor shall write one report and one set of presentation slides that summarizes the communications with these organizations and participation in technical meetings of these organizations.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATIONS (FAR) SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; THEREFORE A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.
<p>Solicitation number NB688000-14-01562 is issued as a request for proposal (RFP). <br />This solicitation and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-69.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541511 with a small business size standard of $25M. HOWEVER, In consideration, and pursuant to FAR 19.502-2(b), there is not a reasonable expectation of obtaining offers from two or more responsible small business concerns that are competitive in terms of market prices, quality, and delivery. Therefore it is in the best interest of the government to solicit this requirement as a FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division intends to procure the development of highly technical and customized software, which will be an essential element for all experiments carried out in the Ion Storage Group in the Time and Frequency Division.</p>
<p>A Sources Sought notification was previously posted from 12/5/13 to 12/20/13, via NB688000-14-9999.</p>
<p>The project is complex and involves a number of independent but tightly interconnected pieces of software, including firmware and gateware written for an FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) using only open-source components (to ensure portability). <br />The successful contractor must have substantial experience with software design, FPGA programming, high-performance timing applications with FPGAs, and interfacing FPGAs with other hardware elements (digital I/O, memory, communications). <br />The successful contractor must also have demonstrated the ability to develop such systems using only open-source, maximally platform-independent elements. This is crucial to the value of the software by allowing it to accommodate inevitable hardware changes and upgrades (which are much less expensive and time-consuming than the software development). <br />Furthermore, the successful contractor must be able to collaborate with a group of basic research scientists, understanding their scientific goals and experimental needs in detail and translating this into architecture, feature sets, and capabilities for the software that will maximize value to the scientists. This is a difficult task for which many otherwise technically qualified bidders may not be well suited. Demonstration of successful previous collaborations of this nature with high-profile scientific groups is very important in selecting the best offer. <br />Line Item&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0001<br />Description&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Experimental Control Software and Infrastructure, cosisting of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;several software and hardware components to be designed for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;maximum long-term use.<br />Qty&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1<br />Unit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EA<br />Unit Price&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$_________.00&nbsp; <br />Total&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$_________.00<br />&nbsp;<br />DELIVERY DATE: 1 year ARO<br />SHIP TO:<br />NATIONAL INST OF STDS AND TECHNOLOGY<br />325 BROADWAY<br />BOULDER CO 80305-3328<br />FOB: Destination</p>

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Corona Division (NSWC CODIV) invites vendors to enter into a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) that establishes the terms and conditions applicable to future purchases of move, relocation and assembly services. As a result of this solicitation approximately 2 to 3 vendors are needed to provide the required services; however, the Government reserves the right to award to a single vendor. A BPA will be issued to the vendor(s) determined to be technically acceptable and offering the lowest cost to the Government, using the Evaluation Criteria established in Section M of the solicitation. Vendors must be capable of providing services within the geographic area encompassing Orange and Riverside counties. Services may also be required at other sites within a 100 mile radius of NSWC CODIV.<br /><br />Definitions
<p>A Blanket Purchase Agreement is a "charge account" arrangement, between a buyer and a seller for recurring purchases of services. BPAs are not contracts and do not obligate government funds in any way. A Request for Quotations (RFQ) is initiated upon the placement of a call from the Facilities Management Division's appointed BPA Caller. The BPA call becomes a contract upon the award of the call to the selected vendor and the vendor's acceptance of the call. RFQs can be rotated among all the vendors on the BPA or one vendor can be selected depending on the urgency and dollar value of the requirement.</p>

<DESC>The HIV/AIDS Senior Prevention Advisor position is located in the HIV Team in the Health, Population and Nutrition (HPN) Office. USAID's Health program in Malawi represents approximately 70% of the Mission's budget and the HIV portfolio currently constitutes almost 50% of the overall Health budget. The HIV team manages an annual budget of $39 million and oversees programs in behavioral and biomedical prevention, care and treatment, health systems strengthening, and OVC and community development. The HIV Team currently has nine staff members. Similar to other southern African countries, Malawi faces a generalized HIV/AIDS epidemic that is spread primarily through heterosexual intercourse, followed by mother-to-child transmission. While urban HIV prevalence appears to have declined somewhat in recent years and national and rural prevalence appear to have stabilized, Malawi continues to experience a severe HIV epidemic. The Government of Malawi has adopted several prevention methods aimed at reducing sexual transmission of HIV. These interventions have seen some decline in adult HIV prevalence over the last decade, from a modeled 13.2% in 2000 , to 11.8% in 2004 and 10.6% in 2010. Yet there are still an estimated 70,000 new infections annually in Malawi.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>
<p>TERMS AND CONDITIONS HSCG38-14-Q-200082</p>
<p>The following clauses and provisions are included:</p>
<p>52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items Jul 2013</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria<br />This contract is expected to be awarded on a sole source basis to Airbus Helicopter Incorporated, however if offers are received from any other offeror, quotes will be evaluated in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 13.106-2 based on the criteria listed below. Award will be made to the offeror representing the best value to the Government.</p>
<p>Technical Acceptability: Technical Acceptability will be evaluated on the ability of the offeror to provide new manufactured commercial items from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) 8130 (preferred) or equivalent European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) Certification, a certificate of conformance (COC) and traceability to the OEM. Part 21 of the Federal Aviation Regulation outlines certification procedures.</p>
<p>Price: The contractor shall provide pricing as requested in the attached spreadsheet titled "HSCG38-14-Q-200082 - Requirements". Any quantity price discounts and discounts for prompt payment should be included in this section. The offeror's quotation will be evaluated using one or more of the techniques defined in FAR 13.106-3, in order to determine if it is fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>Past Performance: The Government may use information available from past contracts/purchase orders with the USCG, delivery information found in the USCG's AMMIS system, and any information found using sources such as Federal Government sources, Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS)/Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS). Offerors are advised that more recent performance is more relevant than less recent performance and will be given greater weight in the evaluation process. In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will be given a neutral past performance rating.</p>
<p>Delivery: The USCG requires delivery of all items by 17 May 2014. Offerors that can meet the Government's required delivery date will be rated higher than offerors that are unable to deliver on time. Offerors that can deliver sooner than the Government's required delivery date will be rated the highest for this factor.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

        (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
      (ii) Examples.
        (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
        (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
        (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
  (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).
    (1) Listed end products.
Listed End Product	Listed Countries of Origin

      (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.

7)	FAR 52.212-1, Instruction to Offerors - Commercial Items (JUL 2013), applies to this acquisition, including the following addenda:

i.	FAR 52.209-5, Representation by Corporations Regarding An Unpaid Tax Liability or Felony Conviction Under Any Federal Law  (DEVIATION) (MAR 2012)  (a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that- 

(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals- 

(A) Are o are not o presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;
 
(B) Have o have not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation);
 
(C) Are o are not o presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision;
 
(D) Have o, have not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
 
(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
 
(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
 
(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
 
(2) Examples. 

(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Â§ 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
 
(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Â§ 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
 
(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Â§ 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
 
(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
 
(ii) The Offeror has o has not o, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.
 
(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).
 
This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.
 
(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.
 
(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.
 
(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.
 
(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

ii.	FAR 52.216-1, Type of Contract (APR 1984)  This is a Fixed-Price with Economic Price Adjustment, Requirements contract.

iii.	FAR 52.233-2, Service of Protest (SEP 2006), (a) Protests, as defined in section 33.101 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, that are filed directly with an agency, and copies of any protests that are filed with the Government Accountability Office (GAO), shall be served on the Contracting Officer (addressed as follows) by obtaining written and dated acknowledgment of receipt from:

Technology Acquisition Center-Austin
1701 Directors Blvd, Suite 600
Austin TX  78744

(4) No modification increasing a contract unit price shall be executed under this paragraph (c) until the Contracting Officer verifies the increase in the applicable established price.
 
(5) Within 30 days after receipt of the Contractor's written request, the Contracting Officer may cancel, without liability to either party, any undelivered portion of the contract items affected by the requested increase.

The amount of liability coverage on other policies shall be commensurate with any legal requirements of the locality and sufficient to meet normal and customary claims.

<DESC>The USDA, Agricultural Research Service (ARS), U.S. Meat Animal Research Center (USMARC) has a project that requires sequencing genomes of cattle. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6 (current as of FAC 2001-24), as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The NAICS is 541380. The Solicitation number AG6538S140087 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The description of items and clauses incorporated in this synopsis/solicitation are applicable to this procurement and will be incorporated into any resultant purchase order.
<p>The goal of this project is to determine interactions between genotypes of host cattle and E. coli O157:H7 bacteria in their digestive tract. Some host genotypes may be more favorable to colonization by this bacteria, ultimately resulting in &lsquo;super-shedders'-animals that are colonized for long periods of time at high numbers and are likely to cause increase overall infection rates. Genome analysis is expected identify marker genotypes that are more likely susceptible to high levels of E. coli O157:H7 colonization. To facilitate this goal, these animals must be genotyped for a broad marker set spanning the entire genome.</p>
<p>These markers can be used in selection programs to reduce the number of &lsquo;super-shedder' animals in the feedlot or to sort animals with high potential to become &lsquo;super-shedders' into different management groups with different vaccination strategies. The work supports the Center's missions of increasing the production efficiency of safe, high-quality food products.</p>
<p>Technical Requirements:</p>
<p>The provider must genotype DNA from these animals for the identical marker set that currently exists on the Illumina BovineSNP50 BeadChip&reg; and the Illumina BovineHD(SNP770K) BeadChip&reg;. These markers are currently a standard for the industry and have been used in other populations at USMARC. The results can be more easily transferred to other populations because of the concordance between this population and other industry populations. A total of 340 (228 with the BovineSNP50 BeadChip&reg; and 112 with the BovineHD(SNP770K) BeadChip&reg;) animals are to be genotyped for these markers. All resulting genotypes must be returned to USMARC.&nbsp; All data needs to be available for USMARC download by May 1, 2014.</p>
<p>Contract Line Item Number (CLINs):  CLIN 001 - Illumina Bovine SNP50 BeadChip analysis - 228 each; CLIN 002 - Illumina BovineHD (SNP770K) BeadChip analysis - 112 each.SAM: Vendor must be registered in the System for Award Management prior to the award of the contract. You may register by going to www.sam.gov. You will need to your Tax ID, Duns Number, Bradstreet number and banking information.</p>

<DESC>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:
<p>1. Would a solution using Loci-CHEM, an open source tool used by AFRL and<br />NASA, as the CFD solver be acceptable if the aerodynamic dataset is provided<br />in a format readable at AFIT?<br />* No<br />2. Would a solution using C or C++ as the software language for the<br />subroutine to interface between the aerodynamic and structural simulation be<br />acceptable?<br />* No<br />3. Do the government furnished model files of the preliminary design include<br />finite element models? Please provide any available information about the<br />fidelity, complexity, and size of these models.<br />* Yes, 60k degrees of freedom, accurate material properties of composite<br />layup<br />4. How many individual operating conditions, flow conditions, aerodynamic<br />cases, or separate analyses are requested? Please provide any available<br />information about the analysis conditions (i.e., airspeed, wing flap<br />velocity).<br />* Representative test cases of flapping are requested to show suitability of<br />the algorithm. Fluid dynamics simulations should be extensive enough to<br />accurately model the states encountered. Wing flap frequency will be over<br />the range of 15 - 30 Hz. <br />5. Please provide any available information about the size and scale of the<br />subject ornithopter (i.e., inset, bird, or larger scale) <br />* 3 cm by 1 cm<br />6. What kind of flapping motion is to be analyzed (i.e., up and down, figure<br />eight, other)?<br />* Up and down with figure 8 induced by aerodynamic effects<br />7. Are the flapping stroke displacements much larger as compared to<br />anticipated deflections of the wing structure itself?<br />* Aero/inertial deflections are on the order of 10%-40% of the rigid flap<br />stroke<br />8. Would a solution that involved two-way coupling, where aerodynamic forces<br />are relayed to the structural solver and structural displacements are<br />relayed to the CFD solver, be of interest to AFIT?<br />* Not for this SOW, since aerodynamic forces should be calculated via a<br />blade element theory based model. <br />9. Is the offeror to perform all aspects of the fluid dynamic simulation and<br />the structural simulation, or will some aspects be performed by AFIT.<br />* I'm not sure I understand the question. Structural/inertial and<br />aerodynamic loads are to be computed by the FEA software.</p>

One or more past performance evaluations will be conducted in order to record your contract performance as required by FAR 42.15. (b) The past performance evaluation process is a totally paperless process using CPARS. CPARS is a web-based system that allows for electronic processing of the performance evaluation report.

Technical and past performance, when combined, are less important when compared to price. (b) Options.

The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only.

The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1313.106?2?70, insert the following provision: Evaluation Utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures (Date) All solicitations using simplified acquisition procedures in FAR Part 13 must include provision 1352.213?70, Evaluation Utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures, or similar language setting out evaluation criteria.The Government will issue an order resulting from this request for quotation to the responsible offeror whose quotation results in the best value to the Government, considering both price and non-price factors. <BR> <BR>As referenced in FAR, http://www.acquisition.gov/far/Reference <BR> <BR>(Full Text - Please see attachment A) <BR> <BR>UNENFORCEABILITY OF UNAUTHORIZED OBLIGATIONS (JUN 2013) (a) Except as stated in paragraph (b) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (1) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (2) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ?I agree? click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ?click-wrap? or ?browse-wrap? agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (3) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (b) Paragraph (a) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.

The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within the period of performance.

<DESC><p>MERALCO Power Distribution Modernization Pilot Project</p>
<p>USTDA Activity No.: 2014-31005A</p>
<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Proposal Submission Place:</span></strong><br />Joseph Allan C. Baltazar<br />Senior Assistant Vice President and Head Network Technology Strategy and Execution<br />MERALCO<br />3/F Technical Services Building<br />Meralco Center, Ortigas Avenue<br />Pasig City 0300 Philippines<br />Tel: +63 2 6312222 Ext. 6482<br />Fax: +63 2 6328538<br />Email: jacbaltazar@meralco.com.ph<br /><br />The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for a power distribution modernization pilot project and associated implementation plan for MERALCO in Manila, Philippines.
<p>BRIEF PROJECT BACKGROUND AND DESCRIPTION OF GRANTEE</p>
<p>MERALCO requested a USTDA-funded feasibility to determine key components needed to complete a pilot project and advance MERALCO system-wide Smart Grid implementation efforts. MERALCO has allocated $10.5 million for the pilot project, targeting installation of smart metering equipment for 10,000 existing customers, to help manage peak demand and set incentives for various consumption levels based on detailed data collected by the smart meters. The pilot would also address demand response to reduce high energy costs, minimize power loss, and define procedures for system-wide implementation of smart grid technologies. The detailed customer information would help reduce non-payment for services rendered, while providing flexibility in billing and electricity consumption, and assisting in electricity generation optimization by incorporating renewable resources in the technology mix.</p>
<p>MERALCO is the largest distribution utility in the Philippines, covering a 3,605 square mile footprint, serving 25 percent of the population, and experiencing over seven percent growth in electricity sales and over three percent growth in customer base.  MERALCO holds a 25-year congressional franchise license (June 28, 2003 - June 28, 2028) to construct, operate and maintain the electricity distribution system in 34 cities and 77 municipalities, generating 75 percent of Luzon's and 55 percent of the overall Philippines' electricity sales. MERALCO's distribution and sub-transmission network has a circuit length of approximately 1,060 miles, 115 substations, and 220 substation transformer banks. About 50 percent of Philippine Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and 60 percent of manufacturing output is generated within MERALCO franchise area to serve residential, commercial, industrial and street-lighting customers.</p>
<p>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF STUDY COMPONENTS</p>
<p>The Feasibility Study will help MERALCO develop the technical specifications and associated implementation plan for a power distribution modernization pilot project, with key components including Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), Demand Response (DR) programs, smart grid-focused Distribution Management Systems (DMS), and system interoperability standards.  The pilot would address important system distribution issues related to demand response in order to reduce user demands, balance its grid, reduce high energy costs, develop and implement DR as a part of its DMS, settle contracts with participating customers, and upgrade and integrate control systems and communications infrastructure to DR operations.  The Study would include a review of MERALCO's medium and long-term modernization objectives, preparation of pilot scope, cost estimate, and procurement documents and bid specifications, as well as assessment of environmental and development impact.</p>
<p>MERALCO notes the following with regard to the Feasibility Study:</p>
<p>&bull;	In the document, Embedded Generation, Renewable Generation, Microgrids and Distributed Energy Resources loosely refer to the same thing.<br />&bull;	As Demand Response will be utilized as a mechanism to reduce ultra-high Wholesale Electricity Spot Market (WESM) prices, the U.S. Firm will note:<br />o	The Integrated Demand Response (DR) and Embedded Generation system will have the capability to participate in the Energy and Reserve markets of WESM.<br />o	If applicable, the business case will include benefits from (a) reducing ultra-high WESM prices, (b) deferment of power generation, transmission &amp; distribution facilities and c) Reduction of Ancillary &amp; Congestion Cost.<br />&bull;	Demand Response will consider embedded generation and will employ the following:<br />o	Interruption of load or control of thermostats of customers.<br />o	Use of on-site generation (PV, Wind Turbine, Diesel, etc.)<br />o	Use of on-site energy storage (Battery, Electric Vehicle, etc.)<br />&bull;	 The inverters will have the necessary features to mitigate the negative power quality impact of renewable generation and to provide support to the distribution grid.<br />&bull;	The Integrated Demand Response and Embedded Generation system may be a separate system but linked to the DMS. Part of the required technical specifications includes the necessary capabilities of the Fault Location Isolation &amp; Restoration (FLIR) and Volt-VAR Optimization (VVO) of DMS to consider Demand Response and Embedded Generation.</p>
<p><br />The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $442,940 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and portions of a background desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

<DESC>AMENDMENT # 02 Synopsis for Ultra Low Visibility Concealable Body Armor (ULV CBA)  <br>  W91CRB-14-R-0015  <br>  <br> Interested vendors may obtain a copy of the approved Technical Statement of Needs (TSN)(AR-PD 13-05 Rev A) by submitting a written request to Lisa J. Yamakawa at lisa.j.yamakawa.civ@mail.mil.    <br>    <br> This synopsis is a follow-on notice to Requests for Information (RFIs) W91CRB-13-T-0034 and W91CRB-14-R-0009.   <br>    <br>  The U.S. Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG), in support of Program Executive Office - Soldier (PEO Soldier) Product Manager Soldier Protective Equipment (PM SPE) has a requirement for Ultra Low Visibility Concealable Body Armor (ULV CBA) system.  The ULV CBA system shall be worn by ground troops conducting non-traditional operations and shall provide increased concealment over the legacy Concealable Body Armor (CBA).  Any resulting awardee shall provide all program and production management necessary to meet the quality standards, reporting systems and supportability required for testing, inspection and delivery of the ULV CBA, as defined by the Statement of Work (SOW) and Technical Statement of Need (TSN). The ULV CBA system, in any of its configurations, is considered a critical safety item (CSI).  In addition, all items being procured under this acquisition are subject to the Buy American Act and Berry Amendment. The Government anticipates awarding up to three (3) firm, fixed price (FFP), 3-year indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ)-type contracts using 100% small business set-aside under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 315990 - Apparel Accessories & Other Apparel Manufacturing.   <br>    <br>  The ULV CBA system is a CSI and is made up of three (3) components: ULV CBA outer carrier; stand-alone torso/side Ultra Low Visible Inserts-Hard Armor (ULVI-HA) that provide select small arms protection; and two (2) sets of torso/side Ultra Low Visible Inserts - Soft Armor (ULV-SA) that provide handgun protection when worn without the ULVI-SA.  One (1) set of ULVI-SA is intended to protect against specified threats prevalent Outside Contiguous United States (OCONUS) while maximizing concealability, the other set of ULVI-SA is intended to provide a universal protection (OCONUS & NIJ IIIA 0101.06).  The ULVI-HAs shall not be used as a substitute for the Enhanced Small Arms Protective Insert (ESAPI) and Enhanced Side Ballistic Insert (ESBI).  The ULV CBA system shall be worn in the following configurations: Primary - ULV CBA carrier with ULVI-HA (torso and side); Secondary - ULV CBA carrier with ULVI-SA (either universal or OCONUS); and Alternative:  ULV CBA carrier with ESAPI and ESBI.  The ULV CBA system (with and without the use of the hard armor inserts) shall have a maximum weight not to exceed between 10.9 (size extra small) & 18 pounds (size Extra Large) and provide maximum concealability under conservative civilian attire (men's dress shirt or women's blouse) and under a military combat uniform.  The ULVI-HA shall have uniform thickness throughout and shall not exceed 0.75 inches.  The OCONUS threat ULVI-SA, when placed in the outer carrier, shall not exceed 0.30 inches. The carrier shall be of a neutral/earth tone color and be capable of quick doffing in emergency situations (between 20-30 seconds) and provide adjustability at the shoulders to permit the height of the armor system to be adjusted.  The soft and hard armor ballistic inserts shall be removable and must be secured by way of a suitable closure system that is secure and is easy to open and close.  The vest shall have side pockets that allow for the insertion of the soft armor ballistic panels as well as hard plates with belly strap(s) for torso adjustment; straps shall be on the outside of the vest for ease of adjustability.  The belly strap(s) shall have elastic properties to permit full range mobility.    <br>    <br>  There are two variations of the ULV-SA, a universal threat package and an OCONUS threat package.  The design of the ULV CBA shall be unisex and consist of a carrier that accommodates either the ULVI-SA or the ULVI-HA separately and be backwards compatible with the current Enhanced Small Arms Protective Inserts (ESAPI) and Enhanced Side Ballistic Inserts (ESBI) plates.  The ULVI-SA universal package shall provide protection capable of stopping pistol threats including: 9-mm, 124-grain Full Metal Jacket (FMJ); 9-mm, 94-grain Steel Jacket Lead Core (SJLC); 7.62 x 25-mm, 85-grain SJLC; .357 SIG 125-grain FMJ Flat Nose (FN); and .44 Magnum 240-grain Semi Jacket Hollow Point (SJHP) with an areal density less than or equal to 1.1 pounds per square foot.  The ULVI-SA OCONUS package shall provide protection capable of stopping pistol threats including: 9-mm, 124-grain FMJ; 9-mm, 94-grain SJLC; and 7.62 x 25-mm, 85-grain SJLC with an areal density less than or equal to .89 pounds per square foot.  The ULVI-HA shall provide protection to defeat threats  quote mark F quote mark  &  quote mark R quote mark  without use of ULVI-SA.  Test Data Submission Requirements for the formal solicitation shall be two (2) V0's and two (2) V50's for each ULVI-SA threat and thirteen (13) V0's with threat F for both the ULVI-HA torso and ULVI-HA side, as well as non-ballistic data.  Offerors shall deliver ten (10) complete ULV CBA systems as part of their proposal; one (1) each of the OCONUS and Universal packages in each of the five (5) sizes, to include the ballistic test data for the ULVI-HA and both versions of the ULVI-SA from an NIJ certified lab.    <br>    <br>  Any questions and/or comments regarding this synopsis shall be submitted electronically in writing to the POC identified below no later than 10:00 am EST on 28 March 2014.   <br>    <br>  The formal Request for Proposal (RFP) W91CRB-14-R-0015 is estimated to be released in April 2014 with all documents, attachments, and amendments posted at the FedBizOpps website located at the following web address: https://www.fbo.gov/.

<p>VETERAN'S PREFERANCE<br />Veteran's Preference is not applicable to this position.</p>
<p>GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT &amp; RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CONTRACTOR: A. General Statement of Contract Purpose</p>
<p>The Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) is responsible for the development, supervision, coordination, and implementation of international narcotics control and law enforcement assistance activities and international criminal justice issues for the Department of State (DOS). Since 2002, INL's Afghanistan/Pakistan Program Office (INL/AP) through its in-country presence at the U.S. Embassy Islamabad have managed several programs to build the capacity of the Government of Pakistan's (GOP) law enforcement and border security personnel through training, mentoring, equipping, and infrastructure assistance.</p>
<p>To date, these programs have built useful relationships and positive results across the country. Law enforcement personnel in Pakistan routinely face improvised explosive device bombings, assassinations, kidnappings, and other terrorism-related contingencies, in additional to standard criminality. Following the deterioration in security in Pakistan's northwest region in 2009, INL-Pakistan quickly and substantially enhanced its law enforcement effort in Pakistan, beginning with an effort to build the capacities of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Police through technical support, training, equipping, and infrastructure assistance. Since then, the program has expanded to include police from the remaining provinces, levies in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas and Balochistan, and other federal law enforcement entities.</p>
<p>Position Elements</p>
<p>1) Supervisory Controls<br />The SPA reports to and receives broad policy guidance and general direction from the INL Director and his/her designate. The SPA is responsible for planning and implementing many aspects of organizational and project and logistical operations. The SPA coordinates and communicates with INL-Pakistan and the INL/AP Pakistan Team. The SPA's actions, decisions, and recommendations are reviewed on the basis of results achieved and conformance with appropriate laws and regulations. The SPA must depend in part on his/her own professional judgment to further the mission of INL.<br /><br />2) Guidelines<br />The SPA is recognized as a substantive authority on overall management and/or interpretation of guidance on program and project planning and evaluation in a specialized area. Therefore, guidelines for this position consist of USG and DOS Acquisition Regulations, and accepted legal principles and theories. In addition, incumbent must be able to determine application of basic administrative policy statements concerning the issue or problem being studied. The incumbent must also consider and adhere to various other existing federal regulations, and the interaction between DOS policies, legislation, the Foreign Assistance Act, and other authorization and appropriations in the INL account, applicable National Security and Presidential Decision Directives, OMB Circulars, and Department of State financial operating procedures and policies.</p>
<p>3) Complexity<br />Develops detailed plans, goals, and objectives for the long-range implementation and administration of the program, and/or develops criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of the program. Coordinating plans with various other groups including international donors, the U.S. Embassy, and the GOP can be complicated. Projects require dynamic leadership and expertise and complex innovation, strict adherence to high-level policy without lower level interpretive assistance, and the ability to single-handedly or in concert with a variety of other stakeholders resolve critical problems and achieve difficult goals that may affect other programs.</p>
<p>4) Scope and Effectiveness<br />The SPA completes extensive assignments in support of DOS, INL, and GOP priorities and activities. Assignments are broad in scope and complicated by many complex features and are technically, administratively, or politically sensitive in nature.</p>
<p>5) Personal Contacts<br />The SPA works closely with the INL Director, Deputy Director, INL staff (including third-party contractors and locally hired staff), and embassy personnel. It is imperative that the SPA coordinate closely with other SG law enforcement entities at Embassy Islamabad, including the Department of Justice. In addition, the SPA maintains contact with host government officials, other law enforcement agencies as needed, and international and non-governmental organizations. The SPA works closely with INL/AP in Washington DC as well. <br /><br />6) Travel<br />Frequent travel in and around Pakistan is required with other occasional international travel.</p>
<p>7) Work Environment<br />Primarily, work is conducted in an office setting and sedentary in nature, but the SPA is expected to frequently conduct meetings at and visit with host government offices and facilities in Islamabad and throughout Pakistan. The security situation in Pakistan is fragile and dynamic and conditions outside of Islamabad can be challenging. The position is located at U.S. Embassy Islamabad.</p>
<p>8) Level of Effort<br />The level of effort required over the period of this contract is 100%. The position is full-time, with a minimum of 40 hours per week and based on the core hours of the US Embassy Islamabad. Occasional work on weekends or after regular work hours is required.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<DESC><p><strong>This Notice of Intent to Establish a Qualified Supplier List is for information purposes only. This is not a request for submission of proposals or qualifications. RESPONSES OR OTHER INQUIRIES ARE NOT APPROPRIATE AT THIS TIME.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) program anticipate issuing a Sources Sought Notification for the establishment of a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Hypothermia Prevention Heat Reflective Shell Rip-Stop/Reinforced</span> through the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website on or about 01 May 2014. This is not a request for quote or proposal.</strong></p>
<p>Examples of items for the QSL could include but are not limited to: Hypothermia Prevention Heat Reflective Shell Rip-Stop/Reinforced, that are utilized for treatment of hypothermia in a non-hospital setting for shock and trauma patients, which are single patient use, impervious to wind and fluids, supplied in both Active (heat source included) and Passive (no heat source), which will accommodate patients based on Height and Weight with the minimum requirements of 78 inches long and up to 250 lbs, and will be able to be utilized as makeshift litter/patient movement device.</p>
<p>The primary objective of this effort will be to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL. The QSL for Hypothermia Prevention Heat Reflective Shell Rip-Stop/Reinforced will be the basis of a separate Standardization Action (SA) resulting in an Incentive Agreement (IA). This initiative will be part of the MSPV program which is executed by the DLA Troop Support, Directorate of Medical Materiel. To participate in the QSL process vendors must have or be in the process of obtaining a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the current Medical/Surgical PV for each MMESO Area of Responsibility (AOR), i.e., Cardinal Health, and Owens &amp; Minor. Vendors who previously had an active record in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) must validate that their account is Active in the System for Award Management (SAM). For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support's MSPV program, please access the DLA web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil. All items proposed to be included in this QSL must be on DAPA for the DLA Troop Support MSPV program. The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (as defined by FAR 52.225-5), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to complete the DAPA TAA Certification. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Bill Woltjen at DLA Troop Support, william.woltjen@dla.mil, 215-737-7124. Detailed information about the QSL requirements will be provided in the QSL FBO Announcement. The purpose of this Notice of Intent to Establish a Qualified Supplier List is to inform qualified entities interested in providing these services that the release of the QSL FBO is imminent. Upon issuance of the QSL FBO, all relevant information will be available electronically on the FBO website.</p>

<p>This is a formal Request for Proposal (RFP). NRL is seeking proposals from sources that can provide a nominal 67 HP, 300 VDC submersible motor system consisting of a hydrostatic pressure compensated motor, controller/drive electronics, pressure housing to contain the drive electronics, and hydrostatic pressure tolerant cabling. It is required that the motor drive controller be enclosed in a pressure vessel capable of withstanding hydrostatic pressure ranging from 14 psia to 682 psia. All other equipment, external to the controller/drive electronics pressure housing, shall be capable of operating while withstanding hydrostatic pressure of 14 psia up to 10,014 psia. Electrical connections for power, feedback, and communication\control signals will be provided through appropriate SEACON connectors mounted on the waist of the pressure vessel. Other critical features include its efficiency at low and high power and its weight. The nominal voltage of the system is 300 V. The motor system will employ conductive cooling through the pressure vessel housing to ambient surrounding water. The volume of surrounding water will not have active flow around the pressure housing(s) of the motor or controller. The motor system will be capable of quiet operation and operating at or below the acoustic levels defined in the RFP. Standard MIL-SPECs will be applied for shock, EMI, environmental conditions, etc.</p>

<DESC>The Army Corp of Engineers Wilmington District intends to issue a solicitation for Operation and Maintenance services at the Philpott Lake Project in Bassett, Virginia.  The Philpott Project is located in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains in Virginia with nearly 600,000 visitors annually.  The Philpott project has over 6,000 acres of surrounding land, 3,000 acres of water, and a power plant make which encompass portions of Franklin, Henry and Patrick counties of Virginia.     <br>      <br>  The Contractor will be responsible for and will provide all planning, programming, administration, management, supervision, maintenance of accurate and complete records and files, quality control inspection, personnel, materials, supplies, parts, tools, equipment and vehicles, except as otherwise provided, necessary to operate and maintain Government owned facilities and equipment for the Philpott Lake Project.     <br>      <br>  The solicitation will be issued on or about 20 March 2014.  The anticipated pre-proposal conference/site visit will be determined at a later date.  The solicitation is 100% set-aside for Section 8(a) Small Businesses as determined by the Small Business Administration.  It is the Government's intent to award a Firm Fixed Price contract. The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 561210 with a small business size standard of $35,500,000.  A fixed price contract will be awarded for a base period of one year with four (4), one (1) year options.  There is no guarantee that options on the follow-on years will be exercised.     <br>      <br>  Any award to be made from the upcoming solicitation will be based on the best overall (i.e. best value) proposal that is determined to be the most beneficial to the Government with appropriate consideration given to the three (3) evaluation factors:  Technical, Past Performance, and Price.

<DESC>FedSelect is proprietary software of CACI Inc. Federal. Washington Headquarters Services (WHS) Acquisition Directorate (AD) initially purchased a FedSelect license and training in 2011. No other vendor can provide renewal software because CACI is the manufacturer and sole vendor of FedSelect renewal licenses. Further, purchasing new software from FedSelect's only competitor would require an initial investment that is six times greater than the FedSelect renewal price, with no potential for subsequent cost savings.
<p>FedSelect is essential to the Government's requirements, and no other product can meet, or be modified to meet, the Government's needs.</p>

Notice: Sole-Source Announcement

The VAMC, Cheyenne Wyoming, intends to negotiate a sole source under "Unusual and Compelling Urgency" per FAR Part 6.302-2 with "Agren Blando Court Reporting & Video, Inc." to provide Court Reporting Services scheduled for 05 - 06 November 2013.   

1.	Description of Action:

a.	Because of the urgent time frames, it will be impossible to solicit the requirement. Usually, the Cheyenne HRMS is given enough time to at least orally solicit local court reporting services, and more often, the price is below the micro purchase threshold. However, because of the short time frame, this has become an "Unusual and Compelling Urgency" in accordance with (IAW) FAR 6.302-2. The purpose of this emergency requirement is to procure court reporting service for one Administrative Investigation Board (AIB) appearance that shall be conducted over a span of two (2) days at the Cheyenne VA Medical HRMS, Wyoming. 

b.	Services for one (1) on-site Court Reporter/Transcriber for an AIB. Previous court reporting services more-often fell below the micro-purchase threshold of $2,500. However, this AIB will span into two complete eight hour days of transcribing of which, there is a distinct probability price may surpass the micro-threshold limit. 

c.  Agren Blando Court Reporting Services has been dependable and highly reliable when called upon by the Cheyenne HRMS to perform court reporting services. They have always exceeded our expectations of performance, and reasonable turnaround times for proving transcripts. Agren Blando provided certified court reporting personnel to include equipment, tools, materials, vehicles, supervisions, and those technologies and technical services commensurate to the court reporting industry.

2.	Person of Contract (POC) Steven R. Gardner, Contracting Officer, NCO19, 970-270-9503
