<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for research focused on the design, fabrication, testing, and evaluation of reactor systems and components associated with both passive and pumped liquid metal systems which will be (non-nuclear) tested in the EFF-TF facilities at MSFC.  This activity shall include: 1) a theoretical analysis for determination of how to accomplish less than 5 ppm impurities in alkaline metal during purification processing and for heat pipe module fill, 2) Generate engineering fabrication drawings for liquid metal purification loop capable of producing Sodium (Na), and Sodium/Potassium (NaK) mixture with less than 5 ppm oxygen content in the liquid metals. This loop must also be designed to be used as a component tester for various rector components associated with pumped liquid metal systems, and 3) Fabrication and fill of both stock quantities and known volume cylinders of less than 5 ppm of Na and NaK using loop identified in item #2(above). NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, 901 University Blvd SE, Albuquerque, NM  87106-4339.  This recommendation is made pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, which implements the authority for 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) for acquisition of supplies or services from only one source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Competition is impractical for the following reasons: In order to properly address the aspects necessary to build, test, and flight qualify nuclear systems, components, and support equipment using non-nuclear testing, experience is necessary in both (prototypic) non-nuclear testing and nuclear testing of US space flight systems. Additionally, the experience related to the flight systems must be related to the reactor system itself, including intimate experience with the pumped liquid metal loop. To date, the United States has only flown 1 system in 1965 (SNAP 10A), making the “pool” of personnel who have flight reactor experience (related to pumped liquid metal) very limited.  Because the work on-going at MSFC is geared towards flight systems, it is a necessity that the components/systems tested in MSFC’s facilities take into account and use the experience that was gained from flight programs in order to decrease time and effort needed for current development (and avoid mistakes based on “lessons learned”) of these systems in a timely manner.  To date, there have only been 2 facilities that have performed prototypic non-nuclear testing of space fission reactor systems.  New Mexico institute and MSFC. The facilities at the New Mexico Institute are the only facilities in the United States that has actually tested a space flight reactor unit (topaz reactors). The same personnel who performed the flight qualification testing of the SNAP 10A reactor are also the same personnel who were responsible for testing the flight topaz reactors at New Mexico Institute.	Other than at New Mexico Institute, the necessary experience to perform the scope of work for this task is non-existent. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on May 7, 2004.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement for the following: Multicasting: Examine techniques (protocols and architectures) for seamless and efficient dissemination of large volumes of data in real-time directly from an instrument onboard a spacecraft to multiple (on the order of 100 users simultaneously), and from one spacecraft to/through others.  This area of research will consider: ·	Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) standard protocols that are at a minimum Technology Readiness Level  (TRL)3. ·	Both reliable and non-reliable multi-file transfers selectable by user simultaneously ·	Spacecraft-to-ground & spacecraft-to-spacecraft requirements ·	Highly asymmetric bandwidth  (2kbps to 150Mbps) links and unidirectional links ·	Intermittent connectivity (up to multi days) on the return channel  Store and Forward: Examine techniques (protocols and architectures) for standardizing automated file store and forward services at tracking stations. This area of research will consider: ·	IETF standard protocols that are at a minimum TRL 3. ·	Support file delivery rate buffering services ·	Providing virtual spacecraft-to-spacecraft communications with connection through the ground, assuming non-simultaneous contacts. ·	Security aspects for both directions of data transfer High Rate Data Communications Technology: Identify appropriate high-rate network and test equipment in collaboration with other GSFC organizations to ensure that components selected are relevant to multiple missions.  Input will be collected from current Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) Ka-band studies that look into communication solutions to support data rates up to 1.5 Gbps at White Sands Complex (WSC).  Identify Commercial Off The Shelf(COTS) high-rate framing standards supported in ground network equipment that could be implemented onboard spacecraft and operate over space links (e.g. DVB (Digital Video Broadcasting), GFP (Generic Frame Protocol)) Automated Time Services: Time synchronization of spacecraft clocks with ground-based time standards has always been a tedious task. Clock offsets are determined manually by analysis of spacecraft timestamps, ground receipt times, and propagation delays. These offsets are then corrected by a manual command. Many future missions are now planning formation-flying constellations with very precise timing requirements for both navigation and science data. The manual methods in place today do not provide a scalable solution for constellations of spacecraft.    The industrial world has seen its timing precision requirements increase with the advance of data communications network technology and robotic automation in factories, power plants, and laboratories. The development of automated time synchronization and distribution technology has followed these requirements and has resulted in a number of techniques for synchronizing large numbers clocks to very high precision.    This task proposes to develop guidelines and parameter envelopes for using industrial time synchronization solutions both with remote time references and local GPS (Global Positioning System) references in the space flight environment.  Networking Technology:	  Examine a new integrated communications system for use by all future NASA cislunar missions including robotic science missions, ISS (International Space Station), man rated reusable launch vehicles as well as Moon-based missions.  The overall communications vision is presented as an end-to-end system design and architecture based on Internet technologies to support a wide range of cost-effective communications options for handling voice, video, and data.  This architecture uses commercial communications technology to extend NASA’s terrestrial network capabilities into space and to enable new types of communications services.  It must be a low-cost, interoperable, scalable communications solution that provides commercially supported, standardized access among ground systems, NASA space systems, and DOD (Department of Defense) systems and meets NASA security regulations.   This will include options for incorporating non-network traffic such as point-to-point circuits and isochronous traffic.

<DESC>The ABL Element of the Missile Defense Agency, Kirtland Air Force Base NM is contemplating an award of a contract to provide advisory and assistance services (A&AS).  This announcement is for information and planning purposes only. This procurement is a follow-on action to the current ABL A&AS contract that is scheduled to expire 31 March, 2005.  The ABL is a high-energy laser system integrated on a Boeing 747 aircraft that is being tested for destroying theater ballistic missiles in their boost phase.

	At present, the ABL office requires approximately 107 man-year (per year) equivalent heads of A&AS support.  The A&AS contractor(s) shall support, provide expertise and oversight/insight and participate in ABL integrated product teams.  The current integrated product teams include:  Aircraft; Airborne Sensors; Battle Management Command, Control and Communication Computers and Integration and Intelligence (BMC4I); Beam Control/Fire Control (BC/FC); Ground Support and Laser IPTs.  The A&AS contractor(s) shall support the ABL office through engineering analyses, segment modeling and simulation, and review and evaluation of segment concepts, architectures and designs.  The A&AS contractor(s) shall also provide specific segment modeling and simulation support to include wave optics and scaling laws, BMC4I predictive avoidance analysis, and Chemical Oxygen Iodine Laser (COIL) design analysis.  The A&AS contractor(s) shall provide specific segment design engineering analysis for atmospheric characterization (turbulence statistics and cloud analysis), laser beam quality, adaptive optics, large optic designs, vibration, aero-optics, the pressure recovery subsystem, and acquisition, tracking and pointing.  The A&AS contractor(s) shall provide specific system modeling and simulation.  The A&AS contractor(s) must have extensive, in-depth and current experience with High Energy Laser (HEL) weapon system technologies, systems and applications, as well as hands-on experience in analysis/experiments and testing with the HEL technologies.  Expertise is required in laser physics, physics, gas dynamics, optical engineering, electro-optics and structural engineering (thermal/mechanical).  Extensive experience is required in COIL for the ABL weapon and solid state lasers for the ABL illuminator, including integrated laser/optical resonator analysis, pressure recovery system, laser chemistry and optical non-linear phenomena.  Experience is also required in high energy laser weapon system beam control, vibration isolation/control, integrated laser controls, laser tracking and pointing and laser beam aim point maintenance, as well as atmospheric turbulence analysis, wave optics codes, high energy laser propagation, atmospheric compensation and adaptive optics.  ABL also requires experience in missile tracking/signatures, high energy laser effects, passive/active missile tracking algorithms and damage assessment for HEL effects, as well as systems-level modeling and simulation to include airborne HEL weapon systems and subsystems, aircraft platforms, atmospheric propagation, ballistic missile threats and mission and campaign-level engagement performance analysis.  Finally, the contractor shall provide support in the areas of security, computer network information technology, technical writing, and graphic support, as well as specialized support in contracting, personnel, and program control.

	Personnel on the A&AS contract shall have a minimum of a Secret clearance, Completed National Agency Check (NAC), or have submitted for a NAC in order to use government information systems and/or to access certain ABL unclassified information.  Access to classified information requires either a final or interim clearance at the appropriate level. Approximately 80% of the personnel that would support this A&AS contract will require a Top Secret (single scope background investigation [SSBI]) clearance that is current within the last five years.  Please contact the Contracting Officer if additional information is necessary (please provide your CAGE code with this request).  Potential offerors shall submit statements of capabilities (SOCs) to this office. Each SOC shall specifically address each SOW paragraph.  Additionally, the SOC package shall contain pertinent and specific information addressing the following areas:  1) Experience:  an outline of previous efforts, specific work previously performed and any in-house effort, relevant to the specific task areas of this effort; including a proposed organizational conflict of interest mitigation plan, if required; and 2) Personnel: the names, professional qualifications and specific experience of personnel who will be assigned to work in areas of interest.  The SOCs must be received by the SPO POC listed below on 11 May 2004.  There is a 45 page SOC page limitation, and submissions must be unclassified.  All replies to this synopsis must reference this sources sought synopsis and number FA8632-04-R-2453.  The A&AS contractor(s) must have, or be able to obtain, access to proprietary computer models owned by the Schafer Corporation.  Submit all responses to ASC/TMK, Attn:  Martin Baca, 1350 Wyoming Blvd SE, Bldg 20200, Kirtland AFB, NM  87117-5536.

Foreign firms are advised to contact the Contracting Officer before submitting a proposal to determine whether there are any restrictions on receiving award.  This announcement is for information and planning purposes only.  It does not constitute an RFP and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear the concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The purpose of the Ombudsman is to receive and communicate serious concerns from potential offerors when an offeror prefers not to use established channels during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  Potential offerors should communicate first with the Contracting Officer to request information, pose a question, and voice concerns before contacting the Ombudsman.  In those instances where offerors cannot obtain resolution from the Contracting Officer, they are invited to contact Mr. Mike O’Neill at 703.695.9122.  For contracting issues, please contact Mr. Martin Baca at 505.846.0775.  In the event you cannot reach Mr. Baca, please call the contracting officer, Ms. Tammie Johnson at 505.846.4060.

The total effort is not expected to exceed 3 months.  After delivery, the Government will be responsible for any further examination, mounting, and integration of these detonators into warhead systems.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within fifteen days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Responses submitted should be in one copy only and must be received within 15 days from the date of publication.  Responses should be sent to AFRL/MNK, 101 W.

<DESC>Microspectrophotometer specifications


We are seeking a microspectrophotometer that we will use in a research project to identify pigments, fillers and binders in paint sampled from paintings and other works of art.

The samples will be in the form of scrapings (transmitted light) and cross sections (reflected light) that will be examined using a microscope equipped with a spectrophotometer,  By measuring the ultraviolet-visible-near infrared spectra (transmitted, reflected and fluorescence) of standards and unknowns we aim to create a database that can be used to identify materials in samples from works of art.

We need the following specifications to do this:

1.  A microspectrophotometer (ms) capable of measuring reflectance spectra from 200 nm to 850 nm.
2.  An ms capable of measurement of transmitted light spectra from 200 nm to 850 nm.

3.  Ability to acquire fluorescence spectra at five excitation wavelengths including the typical values of 254 nm, 365 nm, 405 nm, 436 nm, 546nm. The ability to change these is an advantage.

4.  The entire accessible spectral range, 200-850 nm, should be able to be examined without changing optical components.

5.  A high sensitivity detector is required, a Peltier or thermoelectrically cooled detector is required.

6.  Transmission, reflectance and fluorescence spectra from areas as small as 4 x 4 microns should be obtainable.

7.  The ability to locate the sample under examination using eyepieces is required since the fluorescence may be very weak and our samples are complicated.

8.  True digital imaging is required with still and video image collection possible; the size at least 1.3 megapixels,

9.  The ms should be controlled by software that has routines that can acquire and analyze spectral data.  Software routines must be available for a) optimizing the system b) checking calibration, c) providing for optical alignment.  For analyzing spectra, software should have cursor, zoom, autoscaling, peak marking/labeling.  There should be output to printer or file of a) view through microscope, b) site of analysis and c) spectra from the site of analysis. 

10.  The computer provided for running the instrument should have 2.4GHz Pentium 4 processor or better, video card with minimum 32 Mbytes RAM, minimum 512 MB RAM, Windows 2000, compatibility with Gallery systems (ability to be networked), USB and firewire ports, high speed RW CD and DVD drive (40x), 18” flat panel monitor, minimum 80 GB 7200 rpm hard drive.

11.  Very stable regulated power supplies for the lamps (should have > +/- 0.05% regulation and > +/- 0.05% current ripple)

12.  Two days of onsite training and follow-up technical support via telephone.
The NGA intends to contract for this annual requirement with the following firm, who has appears to meet all specifications needed. Craic Technologies2400 North Lincoln Avenue, Altadena, Ca.91001

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The statutory authority for this acquisition is FAR 13.501 and award is anticipated to be made under a Firm Fixed Price purchase order.  The solicitation number for this acquisition is being issued as a Notice of Intent under NOI4063.  The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-22 dated April 05, 2004. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 325413 and the small business size standard is 500.   The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, with Invitrogen Corporation using Simplified Acquisition Procedures for a quantity of two hundred and twenty (220) 500ml. bottles and fifty (50) 1000ml. bottles of  Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS)of USA origin. NIAID studies focus primarily on viruses that play an important role in disease of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, the liver, and the reticuloendothelial system.  Currently, NIAID employs the techniques of viral genetics and molecular biology to express protective viral antigens and attenuate viral mutants that may prove useful for prevention of disease.  A number of promising live attenuated viral vaccines and virus-specific immunotherapies are under development and evaluation.  NIAID conducts research directed toward defining the cause and epidemiology of medically important viral diseases and developing means for their control. LID engages in a wide range of research activities that extends from identification and antigenic characterization of viruses that cause systemic disease or acute disease of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts and the liver to basic molecular studies of viral structure, function, and genome organization. Scientists in the laboratory employ molecular biologic techniques to elucidate pathogenesis of disease as well as to develop purified subunit antigens and attenuated viral mutants for use in prevention of respiratory, gastrointestinal, hepatic, and systemic viral diseases.  NIAID has tested and used this particular lot of FBS from Invitrogen Corporation and found it to be the only FBS that has "In Vitro Diagnostic" (IVD) documentation prior to irradiation.  This documentation is necessary for future vaccine research to be conducted in the laboratory.  In addition, any other sources of FBS will require extensive testing and delay experiments already in progress.  The anticipated period of performance is from May 2004 though December 2004 and the place of performance is Bethesda, MD 20892.  The necessary items are commercial as defined in FAR Part 2.  This action is under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1 and HHSAR 306-302-1.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition: FAR 52.212.-1 Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items; FAR 52-212-3 Offerors Representations and Certifications Commercial Items; FAR 52.212.-4 Contractor Terms and Conditions Commercial Items; FAR 52-212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statues or Executive Orders Commercial Items.  A completed copy of the provisions on FAR 52.212-3 Offerors Representations and Certifications Commercial Items must be included.  All offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at http//www.ccr.gov/ to be eligible for award.  This is not a request for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NIAID to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 4:00PM EST, May 03, 3004. For delivery through the postal service the address is NIH/NIAID/AMOB, 10401 Fernwood Drive, Suite 2NE70, Room/2NE70C, MSC/4812, Bethesda, Maryland 20817-4812, Attention: William Rosa.

The initial project area will begin at the junction of the San Marcos and Blanco River and extend upstream along the Blanco River to a point just north and west of Interstate Highway 35.  Materials are located within the channel and floodplain area of the Blanco River and low-lying adjacent areas.  These materials are a potential risk to the downstream environment in event of high flows in the river, are unstable and could restrict normal river flow as plugs, negatively impact public use of the river and provide a substantial fire hazard within the City of San Marcos.  The cleanup operation shall remove these materials and properly dispose of them through chipping, burning, and/or haul off to an approved landfill.  The limits of work will depend on the rights-of-entry granted by private landowners and may extend up to 200 feet away from the Blanco River.  However, any material removed shall adhere to the guidelines that determine which trees, stumps, and brush shall be removed under this contract.  Actual removal shall be as directed by the NRCS and/or as marked in the field.  Only one award will be made for the entire project.  The NAICS Code is 562119.  Performance period will be 66 calendar days from receipt of the Notice to Proceed date, which will be on or about April 5, 2004.  This project is unrestricted.

<DESC>SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES

DATE: APRIL 22, 2004

REQUISITION NO: 04Y004704

INTENDED SOURCE: MEDIA 360

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: DATE OF AWARD THROUGH TWO AND A  HALF MONTHS

PURPOSE:

   THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, OFFICE OF PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES,  ADMINISTRATION FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES, OFFICE OF CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT, THROUGH THE PROGRAM SUPPORT CENTER, PLANS TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION TO MEDIA 360.  CLOSING DATE IS MAY 6, 2004.

THE SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROCUREMENT IS:

Statement of Work 

The purpose of this request for contract is to adapt the ACF Office of Child Support Enforcement’s (OCSE) national training video on voluntarily establishing legal paternity for children born out of wedlock and the benefits of a healthy intact marriage to make it suitable for viewing by America’s Spanish speaking population.

OCSE wishes to accomplish this task through a sole source contract with Media 360 – the California-based company that produced for OCSE the original “Power of Two” video under a competitively awarded contract and subsequently revised it under a sole source contract.  Prior to revising the English version Media 360 adapted the original version of the video to make it suitable for viewing by America’s Spanish speaking population.

This request is in response to a specific ACF high-level request to adapt the video to communicate, in a culturally-sensitive manner, to the Spanish speaking population the information in the video as a way of promoting child support and healthy marriage/family formation goals of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, popularly known as welfare reform.

Tasks

1. After award, contractor to meet via conference call with the Federal Project Officer (FPO) to review task and steps necessary to complete video adaptation within the 75-day time frame established by OCSE.

2. Prior to the adaptation of the video script into the Spanish language,  the contractor will be required to consult with representatives of various national or local Latino organizations and/or individuals as a way to ensure that the video reflects the cultural diversity of the Latino population.  The FPO would be in a position to arrange for a consultation between the contractor and representatives of national Latino organizations based in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area during the time the contractor confers with the FPO for Task #1.  It is important to recognize that literal translation of the English-speaking version of the video will not necessarily convey the information intended.  Care must be taken to adapt English-language materials into Spanish so that they can be understood by the majority of Latino mothers and fathers in the United States.  

3. Develop, to the extent necessary, script and storyboard revisions needed to delineate to the Spanish speaking population in a culturally sensitive manner the benefits of a healthy intact marriage, the importance of fatherhood and the process for voluntarily acknowledging paternity, making clear the advantages of marriage and family formation.

4. Recruit on-screen talent as needed to ensure the video’s messages are correctly communicated to the intended audience. 

5. Meet on-site at OCSE with the FPO and other appropriate agency staff to review script and storyboard changes and gain agency approval prior to starting any additional work.

6. If needed, change the title of the video to correctly and in a culturally sensitive manner correctly convey its message.

7. Strive to keep the adapted video to the same time limit as the original, but in no case exceed fifteen minutes.

8. Add appropriate new background music as necessary.

9. Provide the FPO with a rough-cut of the adapted video for review and approval.

10. After review and approval of the rough cut video, provide the FPO with a final cut of the adapted video.

11. Provide OCSE with sixty beta master and 300 VHS copies of the adapted video, including labels and VHS tape jackets.


Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition

It is recommended that this acquisition be awarded to Media 360,Los Angeles, California 90045,  for this project without providing for full and open competition pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1): Only one responsible source, for the following reasons:

 	Media 360 is the company that OCSE contracted with to produce three videos, the original “Power of Two” video and its Spanish adaptation, both of which were awarded competitively, and the revised “Power of Two.”

 	As a direct result of their previous work, Media 360 has the unquestioned expertise to adapt this video to Spanish within the time frame required.  For example, they developed the original English and adapted Spanish script; they have extensive B-role film footage from their earlier work that can be used with little additional cost or effort in this adaptation; and they have demonstrated the capacity to quickly develop the required believable story lines for the adapted message.


THE PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION IS FOR SERVICES FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENTINTENDS TO SOLICIT AND NEGOTIATE WITH ONLY ONE SOURCE (FAR 6.302-1).  A DETERMINATION BY THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO COMPETE THIS PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION BASED UPON RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE IS SOLELY WITHIN THE DISCRETION OF THE GOVERNMENT. CONTRACTORS MAY FORWARD CAPABILITY STATEMENTS TO THE REFERENCED ADDRESS.  INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL NORMALLY BE CONSIDERED SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSES OF DETERMINING WHETHER TO CONDUCT A COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, PLEASE CONTACT DARREN JANSEN, IN ROOM 5C-13, PARKLAWNBLDG., 5600 FISHERS LANE, ROCKVILLE, MD 20857 OR ON 301-443-1857.

<SUBJECT>D -- Conflation Technology
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-ESEAandNORTHROPGRUMMAN
<RESPDATE>042804
<ARCHDATE>05132004
<CONTACT>Karen Edgar, Purchasing Agent, Phone (314) 263-4211 x105, Fax (314) 263-8024, Email edgark@nga.mil - Phyllis Barr, Contract Officer, Phone (314)263-4211+x117, Fax (314)263-8024, Email barrp@nga.mil
<DESC>Based on previous market research conducted by the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA), the Agency proposes to award sole source contracts to ESEA and Northrop Grumman to develop conflation technology using their commercial off the shelf software as a baseline to better suit the specific production needs of NGA.  It is the desire that the deliverable product conflate mapping, charting, and geodesy data from one segment with the geospatial intelligence feature data from another segment. This is a technology that merges data to attain a "best of breed."  In addition to providing conflation software, the contractor will provide, as appropriate, licenses, training, technical support, and travel.  To satisfy NGA's minimum needs the following salient characteristics are identified:


The current set of requirements is directed at functionality that is essential for NGA's current and emerging conflation needs.  The requirements below are numbered for reference.  Numbers do not indicate priority.

Overall requirements
1	Ease of use is paramount.  The software should be intuitive and easy to learn.
2	Footprint is preferred to be lightweight to minimize software and hardware cost.
3	Ease of integration into production is critical.  The software should be flexible in its ingest and should have open interfaces.  
4	Processing speed is important.  Exact amounts of data and processing speeds are not established.
5	Scalability needs to be defined.  Memory requirements to handle larger datasets should be well defined so software does not bomb during operational use.
6	Defaults are needed when software includes tolerances or choices of algorithms.  The vendor should provide defaults, and should document the impact of changing tolerances or algorithms used.  It should be possible to kick off a default process with virtually no choices other than inputs.
7	Source metacontent must be available to the user for viewing, so the user can evaluate the currency, accuracy, resolution, etc. of both input sources at any point during processing.
8	Conflation of all feature geometries to all other geometries is required. It is acceptable that different geometries be conflated in different software runs, but the vendor should define workflows, since sequence of conflation tends to affect outcome.
9	Dynamic segmentation is required to match and deconflict portions of line features.
10	Conflation of more than two datasets is required (for example:  use aero source for all aero geometry and most attributes, add aero attributes from VMap2, pull in all other VMap2 cultural features, pull in DNC coastline and anything in the water).  However, it is acceptable to successively conflate pairs of datasets. If this approach is used, the vendor should provide guidance on the effect of processing sequence, and should recommend a processing sequence.  E.g., start with datasets containing the best geometries, add datasets with the best attributes, continue to lower quality datasets.
11	Ingest and output of VPF is required.*  
12	Dirty data must not be a barrier to the conflation process.*  
13	Population of metacontent must be possible at the dataset/session, feature, and attribute levels.  The precise metacontent requirements are not defined, so software should exhibit the capability of automatically generating and populating metacontent at these three levels.
14	Output of a log file is required.  The log file should describe the input datasets, commands, and output datasets.  The precise content requirements are not defined, so software should exhibit the capability of automatically generating a logfile of the information the vendor deems most useful.

Feature linking requirements
1	Powerful editing tools are needed for manual feature matching, since automated feature matching will seldom be 100% correct or complete.
2	Undo capability is required.  When a user performs interactive edits, it should be possible to undo at least 10 of the previous edits.
3	Iterative processing of automated and manual feature matching would be useful. Automated feature matching would never override manual edits, but would improve in each successive run because manual matches are removed from consideration. 
4	Quality assurance tools should provide for an entire dataset not just the matched features be reviewed by the user. 
5	Consideration of attribute values is required to improve feature matches.  It must be possible to define what would comprise a match (i.e., which attributes, and which values of the attributes).  It must also be possible to define what would NOT comprise a mismatch (i.e., if a value is NULL or unknown, it is neither a match nor a mismatch).
6	Consideration of elevation values is required to improve feature matches.

Deconfliction requirements
1	Use of source attributes in deconfliction rules is required.  For example, which source to use for geometry or attribute values could be based on source characteristics for different feature types on the same conflated result.  Source characteristics could include surveyed, stereo, mono, reported.  
2	Flexibility in populating the geometry of the conflated result is required.  It should be possible to include geometry from either source based on feature type, based on attributes (e.g., choose the more recent geometry), and whether it was matched or not.  It should also be possible to include connectivity vectors or not.
3	Quality assurance tools should automatically detect gaps, cross-overs and overshoots.  It should also be possible to specify rules to check the context of conflation results (i.e., did any building objects get repositioned into a body of water, or does a railroad now run through a mountain without benefit of a tunnel).
4	Creation of connectivity vectors to ensure a continuous network is required.  These should be optional.
5	Flexibility in defining the attributes of the conflated result is required. For example, the output schema could be a union of the input schemas, an intersection, a mixture of the two schemas, or a new schema altogether (with rules that map the source attributes to the target attributes).
6	Flexibility in populating the attributes of the conflation result is required.  For example, an output attribute could be populated by one of the other source, by a function of either source value, or by a rule (e.g., if source A's attribute is null, use source B's attribute).
7	Manual tools for populating attributes would be useful.  Some conflations are so complex that rules would be too unwieldy to develop.  For example, if a bridge represented by three spans on one source is conflated to a point feature on the output source, a user is best qualified to carry over the attributes to from the multiple spans to the point feature.
8	Flexibility in populating the elevations of the conflated result is required.  It must be possible to define the output geometry as a combination of the lat/long from one source and the elevation from the other.  Because portions of segments can match, this implies that the deconfliction software must be able to interpolate a Z value mid-segment.

<DESC>As prime contractor to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NIH, under Contract N01-HB-67129, entitled: Multicenter Study of Hydroxyurea in Sickle Cell Anemia (MSH) Patients’ Follow Up, Extension 1, Maryland Medical Research Institute (MMRI), has need for the services of a Cytogenetic (Chromosomal Study) Core Laboratory with demonstrated expertise in performing cytogenetic (chromosomal study) assessments for patients.  The subcontracted laboratory will be called the MSH Patients’ Follow Up Cytogenetic Laboratory.   The specific intent of the MSH Patients’ Follow Up is to determine the safety of hydroxyurea in long term follow up of adult patients who have sickle cell anemia.  The purpose of the Medical Coordinating Center (MCC) for the MSH Patients’ Follow Up is to provide support for this multicenter collaborative research effort evaluating the safety of hydroxyurea.

Approximately 207 patients, from twenty-one participating Clinical Centers, are eligible to be enrolled in the MSH Patients’ Follow Up–Extension 1.  Recruitment will begin in the first half of 2004.  A cytogenetic (chromosomal study) blood specimen will be  collected for each patient.   Cytogenetic determinations from blood samples will be collected to determine each patient’s chromosome morphology.  Abnormalities of chromosome morphology have been found in sickle cell anemia patients who are not treated with hydroxyurea.  Hydroxyurea has been demonstrated to be clastogenic in onion root tip systems.  Because hydroxyurea has been suspected to be a cause of mutations with oncogenic potential, it is important to know if any chromosomal abnormalities associated with malignancy are present in the course of hydroxyurea treatment.  Thus, it is important to know the chromosomal morphology of Study participants during the Multicenter Study of Hydroxyurea in Sickle Cell Anemia (MSH) and the current MSH Patients’ Follow Up–Extension 1.  Blood in small vacutainers with sodium heparin will be shipped overnight by courier from each of the twenty-one Clinical Centers to the Cytogenetic Core Laboratory where the specimens will be processed to determine chromosomal morphology.  Each small vacutainer will be labeled with a unique identifying number only, to assure patient confidentiality and integrity of specimen analyses.  The Cytogenetic Core Laboratory will contract directly with MMRI and shall be able to: 1) Process approximately fifty (50) specimens each year for approximately four years. 2) Provide chromosome morphology studies on cells harvested after appropriate cell culture which shall be initiated the day of specimen receipt. 3) Provide materials for the MSH Clinical Centers to collect and ship specimens in small vacutainers with Sodium heparin anticoagulant for whole blood (4 ml).   Shipment to the Cytogenetic Core Laboratory shall be in IATA-approved, cool-pack containers by courier. 4) Provide written procedures for Clinical Center staff to collect and ship specimens to the Laboratory.  5) Receive and document condition of specimens from the Clinical Centers.  6) Communicate electronically all results to the MCC within three weeks of receipt of specimens.  7) Maintain an inventory of specimens (i.e., number of each type of specimen, date of collection, and ID number) to be provided to the MCC upon request; 8) Store residual cell pellets and plasma at -70 degrees C and send batches to the NHLBI Specimen Repository once each year; 9) Provide reports of activities to the MCC on an annual basis; and 10) Perform determination of complete karyotype and assessment of chromosomes for breakage (including chromatid breakage), translocations, gaps, inversions, centromere/satellite and other morphological abnormalities.  The RFP (including Protocol) is available electronically at www.mmri.org by double clicking the button entitled RFPs or by contacting Mary Anne Dresler, M.B.A., 600 Wynhurst Avenue, Baltimore, Maryland 21210-2425; FAX: 410-323-8622.  MMRI intends to negotiate one contract for the period of approximately four years with an approximate date of award July 15, 2004.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to enter into a sole source procurement with Nielsen//NetRatings, Inc. to provide Internet Demographic Services and Customized Analysis specific to SSA’s website, Social Security Online.  Nielsen//NetRatings, Inc. is the only known source that can provide all of the requirements described below, and based on previous market research, is the only known source who can provide this requirement most economically.  Interested sources that believe they have the capability to perform the services required should submit a capability statement to Dawn Caracci via email at dawn.caracci@ssa.gov.  Responses shall be marked SSA-RFQ-04-0322, CAPABILITY STATEMENT, and shall be received no later than APRIL 29, 2004, 3:00PM EST.  All responsible sources will be considered.  If no responses are received by the cutoff date, an award will be issued to Nielsen//NetRatings, Inc.  BACKGROUND: A major goal of SSA’s strategic plan is “to deliver high-quality, citizen-centered service.”  An important building block to meeting this goal is to understand the individuals we serve; what they need and how they desire to do business with the government.  Customer insight programs, surveys and demographic data are critical elements in identifying these critical citizen-centered services.  Social Security has provided a robust set of services via the Internet, yet we have not seen the usage that we anticipated or expected.  In order to meet our agency performance measures in the area of online service utilization, the agency must better understand our online customers so that we can ensure that we are meeting their needs through the least expensive method of delivering services, self help via its website, Social Security Online.  As one of our benchmarks in measuring performance of this website, we require the services of a third party to provide us with Internet audience information and analysis that is specific to SSA.  Current analysis tools used by Social Security Online provide data on the public’s usage of our website, but no information on the demographics of that specific customer segment.  Obtaining this type of information would provide us with invaluable market information and profiles on our online users, which in turn, allows us to respond to customer needs dealing with website content and applications.  Nielsen//NetRatings, Inc. is the only known source with the following mandatory qualifications in support of this work:  (a) Privacy protection, including an “opt-in” model, e.g., a panel of members of the public who consent to tracking of their Web behavior on a regular and ongoing basis; (b) Unique individual reporting (versus machine level reporting); (c) Demographic data to include gender, age, income level, education, race/ethnic group, occupation and region of country; (d) Syndicated site level reporting (i.e. https://s3abaca.ssa.gov); (e) Syndicated page level detail (i.e. http://www.SocialSecurity.gov/mystatement); (f) Unduplicated usage across websites; (g) Duration of Internet application usage, e.g., time spent by public in completing the Internet Social Security Benefit Application (ISBA); (h) Loyalty metrics (i.e. retention rate, site visit rate, and site visit return rate); (i) Bi-lingual Random Digital Dial Recruitment of Hispanics.  REQUIREMENTS:  The contractor shall provide several key service components to include:  Competitive Analysis; Strategic and Media Planning; Strategic Usage Data and Corporate Development; Privacy Protection of Panelists; and Strategic Use of Technology.  In addition, the contractor shall provide a customized analysis to answer SSA-specific business questions.  These services should provide both predefined reports and user-defined query capability featuring in-depth measurements of Internet user behavior at home, work, and a home/work combination.  Reports will include unique audience size and composition down to the page level, time spent, demographics, and comprehensive trending.  Interested sources that respond to this requirement are required to include a copy of FAR 52.212-3, Offerors Representations and Certifications – Commercial Items with their capability statement. All questions must be submitted in writing to Dawn Caracci via the email address listed above.  Telephone calls will NOT be accepted.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<SOLNBR>W912DS-04-R-0005
<RESPDATE>031904
<ARCHDATE>05012004
<CONTACT>Scott Helmer, 212-264-9118
<DESC>The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, New York District intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP)'s to award one firm-fixed price contract for the design and construction (design-build) of the new 1st Brigade Barracks at Ft. Drum, New York. Design and construction shall comply with the specifications and requirements contained in the RFP.  This is a one-step solicitation with price evaluation preference for HUBZone small business concerns in accordance with FAR Clause 52.219-4.  The Government will use a lowest price technically accepted selection approach for this selection.  This solicitation is not a competitive open bid and there will not be a formal public bid opening. The design and technical criteria contained and cited in RFP establish minimu m standards for design and construction quality. The solicitation criteria rely predominately upon military design standards for barracks to meet program specific requirements for the Army's Barracks Program.  The successful Offeror must design and constru ct a complete and useable facility, as described in the RFP documents. The successful Offeror must have submitted a clear and concisely written proposal that gives the Government the greatest confidence in the Offerors ability to meet the Governments requi rements in an affordable manner.   Offerors must demonstrate a thorough understanding of project requirements and a commitment to performance in accordance with the RFP in all aspects of project execution.  A site visit will also be scheduled, for the Offerors, prior to submittal of proposa ls, at which time Offerors will be allowed to examine the site. The proposals will be evaluated on the basis of the technical qualifications and price.  The evaluation process essentially consists of five parts: proposal compliance review, technical/qualit y evaluation, price evaluation, final proposal revision (if discussions are required) and final determination by the SSA.  To be considered acceptable, Offerors shall specifically address each of the evaluation factors set forth in the solicitation.  Propo sals will be evaluated on RFP compliance and technical merits.  Price proposals will be evaluated on price only.  Price will not be scored, but will be evaluated for fairness and reasonableness through the use of price analysis.  Technical factors are list ed in order of decreasing importance; Factor 1 is more important than factor 2, which in turn is more important than factor 3.  Within each factor, sub-factors are of equal importance.  To be considered acceptable, Offerors shall specifically address each of the evaluation factors. Technical evaluation includes evaluation of the both the technical proposal and the subcontracting plan.  The criteria for technical evaluation factors for this effort shall include: Factor 1 - Past Relevant Experience of Offeror s Team: The Offeror as a Design-Build Team shall demonstrate relevant experience by the physical completion and acceptance of similar and relevant projects within the last seven (7) years.  Factor 2 - Past Performance of Offerors Team: The Offeror as a Des ign-Build Team shall demonstrate at a minimum satisfactory performance, including timely completion of punch list and warranty work, for the projects submitted.  Factor 3 - Qualifications of the Offerors Team:  The Offeror will provide an organization char t and the key personnel resumes for the Offerors Design-Build Team. Factor 4 Ã¢Â€Â“ Subcontracting Plan:  (a) The subcontracting plan shall be submitted in a separate binder labeled Volume III - Subcontracting Plan.  Large business concerns must submit as part of their proposal their subcontracting projections for this project in accordance with FAR Contract Clauses 52.219-8 and 52.219-9.  All large businesses shall submit a subcontracting plan with their technical and price/cost proposals.  The plan should  be prepared in accordance with FAR 52.219-9.  Failure to submit an acceptable subcontracting plan may make the Offeror inel igible for award of the contract. The submission of the subcontracting plan is in no way advantageous to large businesses over any small business in the evaluation process. (b) Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) Utilization Plan.  (Applies to all Offerors. )  Offerors shall submit a SDB Utilization Plan, to include the following information: (1)  Identification of each SDB concern proposed and the work each is to perform. (2)  Targets expressed in dollars and percentages representing each SDB concerns partic ipation of the total contract value. (3)  Total target value of all SDB participation, expressed in dollars and percentages, of the total contract value. Factor 5 Ã¢Â€Â“ Variant Changes to Technical Requirements. Offerors who intend to submit changes (bett erments) to Section 01010 and/or drawings shall define these changes in Factor 5. A betterment is defined as any component of system which exceeds the minimum requirements stated in the Request For Proposal. If the offeror does not intend to make changes (betterments) to the 01010 Section and/or drawings, the offero r must provide a statement as such in Factor 5. The price proposal shall be submitted in a separate binder labeled Volume II - Price Proposal.  The sections shall parallel the submission requirements identified in the bid schedule.  Provide six copies of bound written material (folded and bound in Volum e II).   Upon acceptance of the offer, the Offeror is responsible for both the design and construction consistent with the requirements of the solicitation and the accepted proposal. OFFERORS ARE TO BE ADVI SED THAT AN AWARD MAY BE MADE WITHOUT DISCUSSION OR ANY CO NTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED. However, the Government also reserves the right to enter into discussions if deemed necessary, and if discussions are conducted the Offerors will be afforded the opportunity to revise their proposal.

<DESC>Navair Orlando Training Systems Division has a requirement to modify the current Device 19G4 and develop the Device 19G4A Desktop simulator. A Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) contract is anticipated with an estimated 3 years of period of performance. North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code is 541330, Engineering services with size standard $23 million applies. The Device 19G4 is designated as the “Gas Turbine Propulsion Plant Trainer (GTPPT).” There is only one Device 19G4, Serial No. 001, installed at Surface Warfare Officer School Command (SWOSCOLCOM or SWOS), Newport, RI. It is a stand-alone unit that does not interface with other training systems.  There are no plans to procure additional Device 19G4 trainers at this time. Device 19G4 is a Machinery Control System (MCS) simulator for the USS Arleigh Burke (DDG&#64979;51) ship class.  The GTPPT provides training for Prospective Commanding Officers, Prospective Executive Officers, Department Heads, and Engineering Officers of the Watch students in gas turbine principles and practices, watch-keeping, and the operation of the MCS consoles.  Students, standing watches under instructor supervision, will carry out normal and casualty control plant operations. Device 19G4A will be a Machinery Control System (MCS) desktop simulator for the USS Arleigh Burke (DDG&#64979;51) ship class.  It will be developed from the Device 19G4 software after it is re-hosted to a Pentium based PC.  The task will transition the software to an Automated Electronic Classroom (AEC) environment with desktop PCs.  The DDG-51 MCS Desktop Simulator will be utilized either as a Stand-Alone Watch-station Trainer for individual instruction, as a Watch Team Trainer with two or more consoles being operated in an integrated mode, as Instructor Led Training where the instructor provides training to the entire class, or as an extension to the Generic Re-configurable Training System (GRTS) or Total Ship Training System (TSTS). There are total of six phases for this trainer upgrade. The purpose of this initial phase of tasking is to incorporate the required modifications to bring device 19G4 up to present day technology and correct known deficiencies in the trainer’s non-ship configuration deficiencies. The next phase is to incorporate the ship’s configuration changes to bring the trainer up to current DDG-51 Flight I configuration standards. The third phase is to develop the Device 19G4A, DDG-51 MCS Desktop Simulator, to the Flight I Standards. The fourth phase is to incorporate all the ship’s configuration changes to bring the 19G4 trainer up to current DDG-51 Flight IA configuration standards. The fifth phase is to bring the Device 19G4A, DDG-51 MCS Desktop Simulator, to the Flight IA, II and IIA Standards. The sixth phase of this effort is incorporate modifications to 19G4 by adding a Flight IIA Electric Plant Control Consoles (EPCC) and incorporating a separate Flight IIA Mode of operation for the entire trainer.

Construction is to m atch the architectural theme of adjacent buildings which are of masonry construction.Design and construction shall comply with the specifications and requirements contained in the RFP. This is a one-step solicitation with price evaluation preference for HU BZone small business concerns in accordance with FAR Clause 52.219-4. The Government will use a lowest price technically accepted selection approach for this selection. This solicitation is not a competitive open bid and there will not be a formal public b id opening.

The successful Offeror must have submitted a clear and concisely written proposal that gives the Government the greatest confidence in the Offerors ability to meet the GovernmentÃ¢Â€Â™s requirements in an affordable manner. Offerors must demonstrate a thorough understanding of project requirements and a commitment to performance in accordance with the  RFP in all aspects of project execution. A site visit will also be scheduled, for the Offerors, prior to submittal of proposals, at which time Offerors will be allowed to examine the site. The proposals will be evaluated on the basis of the technical qual ifications and price. The evaluation process essentially consists of five parts: proposal compliance review, technical/quality evaluation, price evaluation, final proposal revision (if discussions are required) and final determination by the SSA. To be con sidered acceptable, Offerors shall specifically address each of the evaluation factors set forth in the solicitation. Proposals will be evaluated on RFP compliance and technical merits. Price proposals will be evaluated on price only. Price will not be sco red, but will be evaluated for fairness and reasonableness through the use of price analysis. Technical factors are listed in order of decreasing importance; Factor 1 is more important than factor 2, which in turn is more important than factor 3. Within ea ch factor, sub-factors are of equal importance. To be considered acceptable, Offerors shall specifically address each of the evaluation factors. Technical evaluation includes evaluation of the both the technical proposal and the subcontracting plan. The cr iteria for technical evaluation factors for this effort shall include: Factor 1 - Past Relevant Experience of Offeror's Team: The Offeror as a Design-Build Team shall demonstrate relevant experience by the physical completion and acceptance of similar and relevant projects within the last seven (7) years.

(Applies to all Offerors.) Offerors shall submit a SDB Utilization Plan, to include the following information: (1) Identification of each SDB concern proposed and the work each is to perform.

The automatic sensing detection system is not supported at this time.  The system can also be actuated manually.  The existing control system is powered with 24VDC.  The control system components includes a remote Engine Room Fire Control Panel on the Bridge Deck, Engine Room Junction Box for the fire detectors and alarm connections, visual and audible Engine Room evacuation alarms 30 seconds prior to Halon discharge, ventilation shutdown relay system, 12 flame detectors and Halon pressure switches in the Halon distribution piping near the bottles. Request:   This is no t a request for purchase.  We are seeking information on new technologies in automatic fire detection to evaluate for use to control Engine Room legacy marine firefighting system aboard subject boats.  The system will be used in a Category A Machinery Space as defined in reference (a) (4-7-1/11.15).  The Fixed Fire Detection and Fire Alarm Systems shall meet the requirements of reference (a) (4-7-2/1.13 & 4-7-3/11).  We request that companies provide diagrams, component lists, function descriptions, point of contact, etc, for possible/recommended systems.  We will determine if the proposed control system can replace or be integrated with the existing Halon 1301 system.

1.0 INTRODUCTION

1.1 Background

The MV-22 Osprey will be the prime United States Marine Corps (USMC) medium lift aircraft for the next twenty years. The Osprey is a tilt rotor vertical/short takeoff and landing (VSTOL), multi-mission aircraft developed to fill multi-service combat operational requirements.  The MV-22 will replace the current USMC assault helicopters in the medium lift category (CH-46E and CH-53D), contributing to the dominant maneuver of the Marine landing force, as well as supporting focused logistics in the days following commencement of an amphibious operation. The tiltrotor design combines the vertical flight capabilities of a helicopter with the speed and range of a turboprop airplane as well as permitting aerial refueling and worldwide self-deployment.  The United States Marine Corps (USMC) has a requirement to assess and produce the Master Task List (MTL), Master Syllabus and Curriculum for the MV-22 100-600 level Pilot, Enlisted Aircrew (EAC) Training Programs and to assess and produce the MV-22 Osprey Aircraft Tiltrotor Simulator Certification Program. This will be accomplished by using the MV-22 100 Level Pilot Training and Concurrency Management contract currently performed for the Training Concurrency Integration IPT and adding MTL, Master Syllabus and Curriculum for the MV-22 200-600 level Pilot, EAC Training Programs and the assessment and production of the MV-22 Osprey Aircraft Tiltrotor Simulator Certification Program. The training creation effort for the 100-600 level Pilot, EAC training shall be governed by the programs of instructions (POI) and training progression models provided in the Training and Readiness (T&R) Manual and other applicable documents specified by the USMC in this Statement of Work (SOW). The MV-22 Osprey Tiltrotor Aircraft Simulator Certification Program shall be assessed and produced using all appropriate Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Advisory Circulars (ACs) and other applicable documents identified by the Contractor and the USMC. This SOW is a modification to the MV-22 100 Level Pilot Training and Concurrency Management contract currently performed by Aviation Training Consulting (ATC). 

2.0 OVERVIEW

2.1 Contractor Qualifications

<DESC>NOTICE OF SOURCES SOUGHT

The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is issuing a Request for Information (RFI) for Loan Performance Data.  This Request for Information is seeking sources of businesses capable of conducting Loan Performance Data. HUD is seeking access to a large residential mortgage database for the United States that can provide risk analytics.  The database HUD is seeking should have a minimum of 35,000,000 loans and should be updated each month from loan level data provided by 9 of the top 10 loan servicers and both Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs).  A minimum of 75% of the active mortgages in the US should be represented in the database HUD is seeking.    The nature of this procurement will be an annual subscription for mortgage loan on-line information, data and newsletter.  Subscription should include residential loan level database, mortgage delinquency database and prepayment database and access software (collectively referred to as a "mortgage loan performance data and mortgage loan performance system").   Data should be representative statistically of the United States and its component states, major cities and Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs).

It is anticipated that the solicitation will be prepared in accordance with FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items and will be set-aside for small businesses if feasible.   NAICS code is 518210 and small business size standard is $21 million.  It is anticipated that the contract resulting shall be Firm Fixed Unit Price for a 12-month period.

<DESC>This is a Nationwide (all 50 states including Alaska and Hawaii) sources sought notice to determine the availability of potential small businesses (e.g., 8(a), veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business) that can provide assistance in closing out expired Federal Government Contracts, Task Orders, Delivery Orders and Simplified Acquisitions throughout the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) including all regional offices and Operating Divisions (OPDIV’s).  The DHHS has ten (10) regions as follows: Region I - serving Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont.  Region II - serving New York , New Jersey, Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands.  Region III - serving Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia and District of Columbia.  Region IV - serving Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee.  Region V -  serving Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin.  Region VI - serving Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas.  Region VII - serving Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska.  Region VIII - serving Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah and Wyoming.  Region IX - serving Arizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada, Guam, Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands and American Samoa and Region X - serving Alaska, Idaho, Oregon and Washington.  The following OPDIVS are located throughout the regions listed above.  Administration for Children and Families (ACF); Administration on Aging (AoA); Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ); Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR); Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS); Food and Drug Administration (FDA);  Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA); Indian Health Service (IHS); National Institutes of Health (NIH); Program Support Center (PSC) and  Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). Offices that have closeout activity are mainly within the Washington, DC area, but are also located throughout the United States.  As the principal agency for protecting the health of all Americans and providing critical and essential human services, the HHS has embarked on a major initiative in support of HHS Secretary Thompson’s goals and the President’s Management Agenda in a “one” Department wide challenge.  This overall involves bringing together diverse activities which will result in coordinated systems for managing programs.  Directing a concerted effort to standardize various components within the department is essential in achieving the “one” Department goal.  Specifically for this sources sought, we intend to achieve standardization in the acquisition arena within each OPDIV is of particular interest which entails consistent approaches to various acquisition policies and procedures.  This standardization provides for a unified front across the department and also allows for increased efficiency and reduced overhead.  In an effort to initiate some of these processes, senior management officials and other representatives from each OPDIV of HHS met and collectively designed a set of proposed actions for acquisition consolidation.  More specifically, the focus of this sources sought is on   the “closeout function” within the acquisition cycle. The closeout function, while required as part of contract administration, is often an overlooked activity because considerable time and resources are devoted to awarding contracts, rather than closing them out.  Thus a backlog of expired contracts can easily develop as a result of the resource distribution devoted to the award phase and other administrative activities.  The Department currently has approximately 29,000 files that need to be properly closed out.  They include Firm Fixed Price, Cost Reimbursement, Cost Reimbursement /Task Order, Fixed-Price/Task Order, Cost Plus Fixed Fee, Cost Plus Award Fee, Time-Material/Task Orders, Simplified Acquisition, Delivery Order (FSS/IDIQ), Fixed-Price SBIR Phase 1.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 541661 with a size standard of $6m.  This is not an invitation for bid, request for proposal or other solicitation and in no way obligates the Government to award a contract.  Interested parties having the capabilities necessary to perform the stated requirements may submit capability statements via email to bhartley@psc.gov. Your capability statements should not exceed five (5) pages in length.  CAPABILITY STATEMENTS MUST DEMONSTRATE EXPERIENCE IN CLOSING OUT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS, TASK ORDERS, DELIVERY ORDERS AND SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITIONS. All capability statements MUST provide supporting documentation along with the following: 1) company name, 2) address, 3) point of contact, 4) phone/fax/email, 5) NAICS Codes, 6) business size and status (e.g., small business, 8(a), veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women owned small business) 7) provide a listing of services your company provides related to the Federal Contract Close Out experience; 8) list previous Government experience addressing your successes and contract information.  Lastly, indicate whether or not your firm has a Federal Supply Schedule for these services along with providing the Federal Supply Schedule number.  Responses are requested not later than April 30.  Capability statements will not be accepted after the due date.

<DESC>The Air Armament Enterprise System Program Office, Air Armament Center (AAC), Eglin AFB, Florida is examining different approaches for integrating weapons into networks.  This Sources Sought Advance Notice is for Research and Development Market Research only.  Qualification packages are not requested nor desired.  The government is contemplating competitive and non-competitive acquisition strategies.  In order to meet the challenges of network-centric operations, development of a standardized approach for networked weapon data link communications and associated infrastructure is required.  The goal is to expand the role of weapons in the kill chain that includes weapons as a node in the network through a system-of-systems approach.  Integrating weapons into networks will enable improved weapon delivery, responsiveness, battlespace awareness and the capability to determine a weapon’s mission completion.  To meet the objectives of the Weapons Data Link Network (WDLN) Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD), the contractor shall: (1) evaluate and assess the Weapons Data Link (WDL) portion of the existing Transformational Tactical Data Link Capabilities Development Document (TDL-CDD) for requirements and weapons requirements documents. The conclusion of the assessment process will be a recommendation for modifications to existing architecture and requirements documents. The contractor shall develop and update the appropriate associated Operational View (OV), Systems View (SV) and Technical View (TV) WDL architecture products required to define the weapon interface with the network. The contractor shall coordinate the development of the above products between the applicable weapons developers, network developers, and operators.  The objective is to develop a baseline (Net-Ready Key Performance Parameters for weapons) from which a common set of solutions for all DoD network nodes can be derived; (2) based on the WDL Concept of Operations scenarios, evaluate the impact of weapons on the network (to include network loading, infrastructure modifications and human factors) via modeling and simulation; (3) The contractor shall coordinate the integration of the above products into a weapon network flight demonstration for the JSOW, WCMD-ER, JASSM, and SDB munitions; upon completion of the demonstrations, compile final documentation of the above products and make recommendations for inclusion into the processes (e.g. Interoperability System Management and Requirements Transformation (iSMART)) for updating the TDL and WDL requirements documents; and (4) recommend a solution for weapon datalinks to achieve compliance with the JTRS Software Communication Architecture (SCA) by identifying those parts of SCA that seem appropriate for munitions, and highlighting cost drivers.  THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR ANY INFORMATION SUBMITTED, TO ISSUE A SOLICITATION OR ULTIMATELY AWARD A CONTRACT.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this synopsis or the Government’s use of submitted information.  Any information provided as a result of this synopsis may be used by the Air Force in future acquisition strategy decisions and could be used in future RFP(s) which may be released to industry.

<DESC>Request for Information for Proximity Sensor for Active Protection System Interceptors.  Pursuant to FAR 15.2, this notice is being issued as a Research and Development Information Sought.  Contract POC: Patsy Garrison, Phone (256) 876-8762, Email pa tsy.garrison@redstone.amy.mil; The US Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) is soliciting information on technology applicable to performing target proximity sensing in APS interceptors.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR  PROPOSALS.  It is part of a technology survey to assist in the planning of possible future programs.  Informal or white paper responses are encouraged. Currently, the AMRDEC is developing an Active Protection System (APS) for ground vehicles to defend aga inst Anti-Tank Guided Missiles (ATGMs) and Rocket Propelled Grenades (RPGs).  The APS has been designed and fabricated, and is currently integrated into a Light Armored Vehicle (LAV-2) where it is undergoing live missile flight tests.  This system uses a K -band radar to provide precise fire control for launching high explosive interceptors that destroy the threat missile warhead before it can properly function.  The current interceptor contains an isotropic blast fragmentation warhead that detonates at a fi xed range of seven meters from the launcher.  An effort is underway to optimize the threat engagement by investigating the feasibility of using an interceptor borne proximity sensor.  The sensor would be used for detonating the interceptor warhead when the  interceptor and threat missile are adjacent to each other; it is believed that this would mitigate the errors associated with the interceptor fly-out.  Further, it is desirable for detonation to occur when the interceptor warhead and threat missile warhea d are adjacent to each other.  At this point it is assumed that the missile warhead is near the forward section of the missile, so a leading edge indicator appears to be best suited.  It is envisioned that the sensor package would be integrated into the fo rward section of the interceptor, and apertures would be mounted either on the side, or in the front of the interceptor, possibly behind a dome.  Other requirements include:  Interceptor velocity: 100-200 m/s; Interceptor trajectory:  1-2 meters above grou nd level, constant altitude; Threat missile length:  1-2 meters Threat missile velocity: 50-500 m/s; Point of closest approach:  0.1-3.0 meters; Missile crossing angle with respect to interceptor longitudinal axis:  -20 to 20 degrees.  Volume available for  electronics:  80 mm X 80 mm X 80 mm.  Questions or comments on demonstrated or potentially feasible technologies for this application are invited and should be addressed to the POC below.  Appropriate proprietary claims will be honored and protected to pr event improper disclosure.  Responses (3 copies) shall be provided by 28 May 2004 to US Army Aviation and Missile Command, Building 5400, AMSAM-AC-OS-RBB/Patsy Garrison, Redstone Arsenal, AL  35898, or via email: patsy.garrison@.redtone.army.mil/.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items as
prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 and FAR 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; a written solicitation will not be issued.  The  Solicitation Notice is No. AB133F-04-RP-0039 is issued as a Request for Proposals (RFP).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular No. 97-25.    Background and Objective: NOAA's Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC) provides scientific and technical support to the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) for the management, conservation, and wise use of the west coast's marine and anadromous resources.  The Fisheries Resource and Monitoring Division (FRAM) of the NWFSC is charged with conducting research and scientific analysis on the groundfish fisheries within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) off the coast of Washington, Oregon and California.  FRAM Division of NWFSC has a requirement for Aberdeen-style trawl gear to be used for resource assessment and other fisheries research activities.  The trawls will be fished from chartered commercial trawlers ranging from 400 to 650 horsepower, and will be spread by 5 foot by 7 foot steel Vee-doors.  The trawls will be used throughout the region where FRAM conducts its assessment and research activities, i.e., the waters off the west coast of the continental United States, from the Canadian boarder to the Mexican boarder.  The d depth strata will range from near shore environments of 30 fathoms (180 feet), out to depths of 700 fathoms (4200 feet), and will be towed over variable topography and bottom types.  Currently, FRAM deploys four nets per season, on two separate and distinct passes down the coast (North to South).  The of these nets were purchased in 1999.  all nets have seen significant wear and use.  Since 2000, FRAM has expanded its survey capacity.  In 2002, FRAM's West Coast Survey Team deployed their nets approximately 37 percent more than in 2000 from 363 to 575 tows) while in 2003 net deployment increased another 11% from 2002 (575 to 641 tows).  In 2004 FRAM proposes to survey 900 plus sites with 6 vessels, this represents an overall increase of approximately 250 percent in net deployments and a 33 percent increase in total vessels used from year 2000.  The time between passes has been truncated significantly but the necessity to refurbish the nets has not been diminished.  Six years of survey work has taken its toll on the trawl gear.  This acquisition of eight new nets would solve many problems.  1) Reliability:  As mentioned earlier, damage and wear has been demonstrated because of regular survey deployment.  New nets built according to specific specifications will enhance consistency and diminish the possibility of gear failure.  2) The introduction of eight (for a grand total of 12 nets) new trawls int the net rotation would allow FRAM  to carry out its second "pass" down the coast without having to refurbish the nets at a private net loft in the five to ten days it currently has scheduled these passes.  Because the gear will be used on small chartered commercial vessel fishing under adverse circumstances and with limited repair facilities, it is especially important that the gear be fabricated by vendors with substantial experience supplying Aberdeen-style trawl gear to the coastal groundfish fisheries and the class of vessels likely to participate in FRAM's research and resource assessment programs, and the gear must be built according to accepted industry practices and with specified materials listed in the trawl and rigging specifications.  (Offers must request copies of the drawings and diagrams from the contract specialist, Jan Sullivan).  Technical specifications:  The following are required:  1) Up to eight (8) Aberdeen trawl bodies and codends with floats installed, as well as all rigging for each individual net will be included and built according to the figures in the drawings.  Due to NMFS's adherence to strict trawl standardization protocols, all nets must pass measurement and mesh count before product acceptance.  2) Float brand name, model type, and buoyancy must be specified.  3) Minor variations in design or alterations in the general panel shapes, dimensions, or specified mesh sizes will not be accepted.  Minor variations in materials will be considered but must be justified and described in the technical proposal; any proposed alternative materials must accompanied by manufacturer's specifications demonstrating their suitability.  4) Two 104 footropes as depicted in the diagrams.  The 8-inch and 10-inch rubber discs of the wing and throat sections must be packed under moderate tension, with no smaller or larger diameter discs in between.   The 8-inch rubber discs must be of the conveyer belt style.  The 10-inch rubber discs of the throat must be rubber tire style.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items or services IAW with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ) No. D45085. The solicitation clauses and provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 97-27. The Standard Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541990. The FDA intends to issue a purchase order on a sole source basis to IBossWell, Inc., 2809 West 86th Street, Leawood, Kansas, for a Leadership Development and Change Management Program.  The contractor shall have a scientific background with experience in Clinical Pharmacology and Organizational Development and Leadership. The contractor shall perform as a management consultant and facilitator who has familiarity and knowledge of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Office of Clinical Pharmacology and Biopharmaceutics organization procedures. 

The contractor will need to perform the Scope of Work, which is to include:

Phase I:  Assessment and Recommendations; To effectively accomplish the above stated goals in “Understanding of Needs”, it is important to start with the key leadership. The first step is assessment and information gathering:  what do you, as the primary leader desire from the group?  What do you see as the key opportunities and challenges/obstacles in accomplishing your goals?  How does the leadership group within the office feel about the plan, their teams, their own skill sets – relative to successful implementation of the plan?  Phase I of this project is designed to assess your current situation within key leadership, and determine the opportunities and barriers that can influence the accomplishment of the plan’s goals.  This would be accomplished through:
·	Attendance at several leadership and team meetings
·	Individual interviews/conversations with leadership and other key stakeholders
·	Delivery of detailed recommendations for Phase II and initial recommendations for Phase III.  

Utilizing a professional outside consultant provides a direct, visible, specific program for implementing this project.  Such a third party also provides a confidential, unbiased and safe venue by which to gather comprehensive and candid information from key group members.  The first steps of the process combine this information gathering, both from you as the primary leader, as well as leaders within and outside OCPB.  This will help to set the stage for future work.

Phase II: Initial Solution Work with Leadership Team would include initial work with the leadership group to set the stage for growth, development and change management.  The influence of leadership on the change process is critical, having their support and alignment, as well as enhanced skill sets to serve as change agents is vital to the success of the program.  Enhancing their understanding and alignment behind both the plan, as well as the growth, development and change process is the goal of this phase.  Phase II would be conducted through a 2 ½ to 3 days off-site workshop/meeting.  The goals of this meeting would include:
·	Skills building in communication, leadership, team dynamics and change management process
·	Input into a plan and process for Phase III where further leadership and staff development would take place over an extended period of time, to help ensure successful implementation of the strategic plan.
·	Creation of initial individual and team goals specific to leadership growth, development and the change process.  (These goals can also help feed into the Individual Development Plan process in the future.)
·	Learnings gleaned from this process will help inform the creation of a full proposal for Phase III, Continued Solution Work throughout the Office of Clinical Pharmacology and Biopharmaceutics which will be delivered at the end of Phase II.

Deliverables: The contractor shall submit the following reports/deliverables:
1.	An assessment and recommendation in the form of a report.
2.	Initial work based on recommendations in Phase I (continued meetings, 2-3 day workshop)
3.	Report on work based on Phase I and Phase II

The FDA intends to make an award immediately following this notice. The anticipated period of performance will be approximately May 4, 2004 though October 31, 2004.

The following FAR clauses shall apply to the solicitation: 52.212 Instructions of Offerors-Commercial; 52.214-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items; and 52.232-33 Electronic Funds Transfers.

1.0 SCOPE. General.

	a. The United States Army Special Operations Command (USASOC) is responsible for the training, equipping and readiness of Army special operations forces.  As part of an equipment procurement strategy to ensure that the Special Operations Teams – Alpha (SOT-A) remain a valuable and viable component of the special forces groups, USASOC has purchased a variety of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and Government-Off-The-Shelf (GOTS) Signals Intelligence (SIGINT)/Electronic Warfare (EW) equipment for use by the SOT-As.  Most of this non-standard equipment has been issued in small quantities to various units based on mission requirements.  The resultant mix of low density equipment provides the SOT-As with an enhanced capability but poses serious training challenges.  There is no institutional training solution within USASOC or the Army and attempts to develop one have been unsuccessful.  The requirement is for one contract SIGINT/EW systems trainer. 

	b. The contractor shall develop a program of instruction (POI) for training SOT-A members the tactics, techniques and procedures for collecting and exploiting sophisticated signals using specified non-TO&E equipment issued to the SIGINT/EW collection teams assigned to the Special Forces Groups.  The POI will be a deliverable that will remain with USASOC.

	c. The contractor shall travel to various special operations forces’ unit locations to conduct training to SIGINT/EW collection team members (Army and Navy) on the tactics, techniques and procedures for collecting and exploiting sophisticated signals using specified non-TO&E equipment issued to the Special Forces Groups.

	e. The contractor shall not employ any person who is an employee of the United States
Government if the employment of that person would create a conflict of interest.

	f. The contractor is cautioned that off duty active military personnel hired under this contract may be subject to permanent change of station (PCS), change in duty hours or deployment.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 03 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR NULL OPTICS FOR ASPHERIC MIRRORS.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s)in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ. The purpose of this amendment is to post the information obtained when NASA/MSFC received the following question from a potential vendor in reference to the solicitation listed above and to provide the answer provided by the NASA/MSFC technical point of contact. QUESTION: "The original files posted on the website were in Code V format.  These files had information regarding the tolerancing information for the optics to be manufactured. The Zemax format was requested and sent to the vendor; however, when the Zemax format files were opened, there was no tolerancing information specified in the Zemax file."  The vendor requested the tolerancing information in Zemax format. ANSWER/REPLY:  The tolerancing that is generated by the Code V software is not transported when converted to Zemax format, and therefore, NASA/MSFC does not have the tolerancing in the Zemax format. The due date for receipt of offers is not extended.  The date April 30, 2004, remains as previously stated. Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on April 06, 2004. Documents related to this procurement are available over the Internet.  These documents reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR VACUUM BOX FOR THE NEXT GENERATION LAUNCH TECHNOLOGY.	Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions posed by interested parties. The due date for responses is extended until 4:30 p.m. CDT on May 5, 2004.   All contractual and technical questions must be in writing (e-mail or fax) to Michele Ladrach not later than April 30, 2004.	Telephone questions will not be accepted. Answers to questions posed are as follows: 1Q.  Is solicitation # NNJ04057583Q "Vacuum Box" for the NGLT Reaction Control Engine considered a Liquid Oxygen tank and therefore requires a that level of cleaning?  1A.  No.  There are no requirements for LO2 cleaning. 2Q.  Will NASA drawings in electronic format be made available to the fabricator?  If so, in what format/software are they available? 2A.  NASA 3-D model files can be provided in a Pro-E, STP, IGES, or other formats. Drawings can be provided in many formats (DXF, etc).  PDF is also available. 3Q.  Are there any limitations on the stiffener locations - both internal or external? 3A.  There are limitations on internal stiffeners.  In the design process, NASA can work with the vendor to agree on locations.	External stiffeners also have limits such as 1” away from and not over flanges.  4Q.  Please confirm that all external stiffeners, if used, may extend a maximum of 6" on each side (including top and bottom) to within the external envelope tolerance of +6" per side as stated on Note 8 on NASA Drawing SLN24100309? 4A.  External stiffeners should be limited to 1 inch as noted in Question #3, but exceptions may be agreed to as required. 5Q.  For the sides that have the structural flange extensions, is the +6" measured from the flange extension edge or from the side of the vacuum box? 5A.  The +6 inches is from the side of the vacuum box. 6Q.  Reference SOW Section 3.4.1; Are there more specific details of how the vacuum box is attached to the system's primary structure in order to avoid any potential interferences between the system primary structure and any external stiffeners, if used? 6A.  Once this purchase order has been awarded,NASA can provide those details.	Basically all box features must be away from surface of the attaching brackets on top and bottom of the box.  7Q.  Materials of construction are shown on NASA drawings as 304L/316L.  May dual certified 304/304L or 316/316L grade materials be used or is there a preferred/required grade of stainless? 7A.  Dual grade materials are accepatable. 8Q.  What proper clearances (envelope area/space) must be maintained around all flanges both on the inside and outside surfaces of the vacuum box? 8A.  Cylinder of 1" radius around flanges and extending outward from box. 9Q.  Reference NASA Dwg SLN24100309, Note 9; Is there a specific, measurable value that would be used to define the final surface finish requirements for both the internal and external pieces of plate material used to construct the vacuum box? 9A.  One direction sanded finish per plate  with no pits or blemishes with 63 microinch finish or better. 10Q.  Reference SOW Section 5.1; Shall the contractor assume the contract kick-off meeting will be held at the contractor's facilities? 10A.  Yes. 11Q.  We are respectfully requesting a bid due date extension to May 7, 2003. 11A.  NASA is extending the due date for proposals to 4:30 CDT May 5, 2004. 12Q.  Reference SOW Section 3.5.5; In addition to the proof pressure test, we are assuming a helium mass spectrometer leak test with a defined retention period will be part of the test requirements confirming the vacuum box is capable of being pumped down to and maintained at a pressure of 1x10-6 torr.  12A.  That would be an acceptable test. 13Q.  Are there any other additional verification or performance tests required? 13A.  Other test requirements (other than proof, leakage/vacuum) would be the verification of dimensions, drawing requirements. 14Q.  Must the contractor provide the mating blind/blank flanges, gaskets and mounting hardware for any and all flange connections that do not have optical viewports installed? Are all mounted for shipment to the jobsite with the vacuum box shipped under vacuum or a small positive pressure or just temporary covers/closures that are not vacuum tight with the mating components shipped loose?  14A.  Yes.  The vendor will need to provide those required to be able to accomplish testing at the vendor. 15Q.  Are spare parts required such as gaskets for all conflats? 15A.  No. Spare parts are not required. 16Q.  Any necessary provisions to be incorporated onto the vacuum box for lifting, moving, handling or supporting? 16A.  The hole features top and bottom are intended for attachment of any lifting features.  The vendor will need to provide any features or devices required for lifting in their facility. 17Q.  Source for full access to all NASA standards and specifications referenced in the subject solicitation? 17A.	     http://standards.nasa.gov/        18Q.  Under Evaluation-Commercial Items #1 wants information on 3 past Vacuum Chamber contracts.  Is this information on work that we have already done?  Or is this information that you would supply on the last 3 contractors that have already made these vacuum chambers?    18A.  Information on work the contractor has already completed. 19Q.  Ref.: Note # 9 on Drawing # SLN24100309 -- (a) Is a #1 pickled mill surface sufficient on plates? (b)  Is some level of polish required? 19A.  a.  Pickling is not preferred.       b.  The Surface finish of 63 microinch or better. 20Q.  Drawings: Two decimal tolerances are often not realistic on weldments.  Can tolerance exceptions be taken on drawings with NASA approval? 20A.  Yes.  Exceptions may be taken on dimension tolerances.  21Q.  Regarding this requirement on the capability to absorb 250 BTU/Hr heat leak from each of the tree RCE's and continue to function normally as stated in 3.4.2.6  It is assumed that "function normally" means to provide the requisite support during normal operating conditions.  It is also assumed that the maximum temperature the box would reach would be the interface temperature of 250 F.  The design will be based on the boxreaching 250 F during normal operating conditions as stated in 3.7.2.2.  No heat transfer calculation would be required. - Please confirm  - Alternatively, if this interaction is not correct and the heat absorption capability of the box needs to be calculated them please provide the heat sink conditions internal and external to the box during test firing of the engines (i.e. outside full vacuum at a constant 70 F, and inside full vacuum at the interface temperature of 250 F.)  21A.  It is correct that no heat transfer calculations are required on the vendor. The SOW/specification should have only stated the maximum temperature. 22Q.  Does the weight limitation for this chamber include the weight of the closure flanges, viewports and hardware or only the chamber as shown on the applicable drawing?  22A.  It only includes the chamber as shown in the drawings and door as indicated in the SOW. 23Q.  What is the maximum deflection allowed for the sides and door of the chamber?  23A.  The only requirements that would affect maximum deflections are the factors of safety on stresses and leakage.  Otherwise there are no specific limitations on deflections. 24Q.  Since the flanges on some walls prevent optimum location of reinforcing beams, can the reinforcing beams be placed inside the chamber? That being asked, would the chamber inside walls then have to be moved out to preserve the inside dimensions?  24A.  Reinforcing beams can be placed on the inside of the chamber on a case by case basis.	The walls would not need to be moved out. 25Q.  Again, speaking of the necessary reinforcement for the chamber walls. Is there a "keep away" zone around any of the flanges (internal or external to the chamber) that is needed for the attachment of the apparatus that will be connected thereto? 25A.

<DESC>14.  DESCRIPTION OF AMENDMENT/MODIFICATION (Organized by UCF section headings, including solicitation/contract subject matter where feasible.
1.  Liability Searches (Potentially Responsible Parties) are considered to be a specialized discipline.  Offerors who wish to be considered only for award of that portion of the work may so indicate and respond only with their qualifications for this work.    2.  Resumes exceeding one page will not be read beyond the one page limitation.    3.  The 25 page restriction for the task order is enforced.  When adding the resumes to the proposal, if the total pages exceed the 25 page limitation, the technical aspect of the proposal will be cut so that the total page count does not exceed the 25 page limitation.    4.  The cost estimate spreadsheets count toward the 25 page limitation.  The CO will advise the selection panel of the total number of pages in each price proposal.  Reductions will be made in order to bring the number of pages in each proposal within the 25 page limitation, if these are exceeded when adding in the number of pages for cost estimates.  Cover letters, cover sheets, dividers, all count toward the 25 page limit.     5.  For clarification, the 25 page limitation applies for the total of the projects, not 25 pages per project.
Except as provided herein, all terms and conditions of the document referenced in Item 9A or 10A, as heretofore changed, remains unchanged and in full force and effect.
