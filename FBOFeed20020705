<DESC>Provide complete 75 kb sequence of aflatoxin biosynthetic gene
cluster from 5 isolates of Apsedrgillus with an accuracy better than 1 error per 2000 pb (99.95%).  ARS will provide high quality genomic DNA sequence information derived from a single aflatoxin producing strain.  Sequence information is available for all genes in the cluster, as well as, most non-coding regions.  Sequence is available for both ends and the middle of the cluster.  The contractor will develop the necessary cloning strategy to separate the required sequence from other sequences, carry out the sequencing with sufficient coverage to provide the requisite accuracy, and perform sequence assembly.  Finally, the contractor will provide the sequence in the format accessible to common databases, such as Genbank.  Contractor will provide: 1) Cosmid, fosmid or BAC genomic libraries for each isolate. 2) Isolate clones from these libraries containing the entire 75 kb aflatoxin biosynthetic cluster using known sequence information for comparison. 3) Shotgun subclone form the socmid clones. 4) Sequence subclones to at least 6X coverage to provide sequence accuracy of >99.95%. 5) Assemble sequences from subclones. 6) Provide sequence in database accessible format.  We would prefer a strategy based on cloning and shotgun sequencing.  However, other strategies (i.e. long range PCR with high fidelity polymerase) will be considered.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The background count rate for this region under the same conditions shall not exceed 10 CPM. (6) The two PMT's shall be able to operate in a non-coincidence mode for Cherenkov and luminescence counting.  It shall be possible in this mode to record the spectrum from these PMT's.  The normal operation of the PMT's shall be in coincidence mode. (7) There shall be the capability for determining the relative Compton photon production efficiency (quench) in a LS vial.  The number of measurements to be made on each vial shall be software selectable from 0 to at least 5.  The measurement time using the source shall be software selectable up to at least 60 seconds.
(8) There shall be a phase separation monitor capable of detecting nonhomogeneous samples.  An error code or flag to alert the user of such conditions shall be provided.
(9) There shall be a non-radioactive static control mechanism to dissipate static electricity on the outside of a LS vial before it enters the counting chamber. (10) The LSC system shall incorporate a bi-directional sample changer that is capable of handling at least 300 standard vials or 500 small vials. (11) The counter shall be capable of collecting and storing for later retrieval and analysis the complete unaltered spectrum acquired by the MCA for each measurement on each LS vial.  The counter shall store the sample rack number, the sample position within the rack, the date of the measurement, the starting time of the measurement accurate to one second, the actual livetime of the measurement accurate to one second, a quench parameter, and an error number or other parameter to indicate phase separation or problems in the measurement.  The counter shall be capable of continuing all of its normal operations in automatic count mode if the computer unit is being used for another purpose. (12)The counter shall have an automatic diagnostic and calibration routine that, as a minimum, tests the mechanical and electrical components of the counter unit for proper operation, measures the background count rate for each PMT separately and in coincidence, measures the tritium counting efficiency for each PMT, performs a Chi-squared test, and displays the results.  At least the background, tritium efficiency and sensitivity shall be stored so as to maintain a record of the results.  The system diagnostics shall allow a historical report of the background, calibration and performance data for at least the last 100 calibrations. (13) The counter shall be capable of performing an "on demand" count during a sequence of automatic counts.  It shall also return the system to the "interrupted" sample without losing any of the count/sample data and continue counting samples. (14)The system shall have provisions for the storage of at least 20 User defined counting protocols, with the option for overwrite protection.  These protocols shall be protected against loss during power failure.
(15) In the event that the AC power to the counter unit goes off, the counter unit shall be able to resume operation automatically when the AC power comes back on.  The counter unit shall not lose any data acquired before the start of the measurement in progress at the time of the power failure and it shall not lose track of the correct date and time or of the sample rack number and sample position. The measurement in progress shall be restarted. (16)The counter shall be capable of transferring, storing, processing, and reprocessing any number of times all of the acquired spectra.  Spectral data shall be available as an Excel spreadsheet and/or standard ASCII text files if so desired.  Analysis reports shall also be exportable and/or saved as requested by the user. (17) The computer unit shall be capable of displaying and printing the integral count rates for at lease 3 software selectable regions in the spectrum currently being collected or in any stored spectrum. Each of the regions shall be able to include any portion of the channels in the spectrum.  The user shall be able to dynamically adjust these regions during analysis. (18)The computer unit shall be capable of displaying on the monitor the spectrum that is currently being collected by the MCA or any stored spectrum.  The boundaries of the integral regions shall also be displayed.  The display is to be in the form of an X/Y graph.  The X axis shall be software selectable from a range of approximately 0 to 20 keV beta particle energy up to a range of 0 to 2000 keV.  The system shall also be capable of displaying sample count rate as a function of time in either a two or three-dimensional format.  The Y axis shall be adjustable in scale and be able to toggle between linear and log scale. (19) The system shall be able to print out at lease the following items for each spectrum: starting date, starting time accurate to one second, livetime accurate to one second, total counts in each region, total count rate in each region, a quench parameter, an error number or other parameter to indicate phase separation or problems in the measurement, and the complete spectrum as a listing of counts (or count rate) in each channel.  Any or all of these items, in any order, shall be software selectable for printing on the system printer. (20) The system shall provide for corrected DPM output based on quench curves for single, dual, and triple label counting.  These counting modes shall utilize automatic quench correction for counting efficiencies and window settings.

<DESC>Amendment 01 to Solicitation NA1341-02-Q-0547

Solicitation NA1341-02-Q-0547 dated June 20, 2002 has been amended to address the following vendor questions and statements as well as to extend the due date for offers to be July 15, 2002 at 3:00pm. ***Statement: The National Institute of Standards and Technology appears to be purchasing an instrument, under the above-reference solicitation, that is about out of date. We find it virtually impossible to bid on the procurement because it specifically references an out of date device of little current utility in the rapidly burgeoning field of particle characterization.
Answer: This instrument will not be solely used for particle size characterization. Instead, the research is directed at making light-scattering materials property measurements for a wide range of complex materials. The specifications stated in the solicitation should allow us to make measurements at a higher degree of precision and accuracy than any known commercial apparatus. According to the light scattering principle, small measurable, reliable angle provides larger probing length scale. Correspondingly, larger angle measurements give a smaller probing scale.  It is critical to have these capabilities so that we can ensure the precise and accurate measurements of large length scale structure. If an offeror can build an instrument that performs at measurement angles less than 5 degree, it will be a plus.  These specifications, therefore, should be viewed as being minimally acceptable for our needs.  ***Question: Missing from the solicitation are all details describing the types of particles (molecules?) the instrumentation is to measure. Answer: This instrument will not be solely used for particle size characterization. Instead, the research is directed at making light-scattering materials property measurements for a wide range of complex materials.***
Question: What is the range of sizes to be examined? Answer: The measurement size scale mentioned in the specifications refer to measurable  length  scale and is not limited to particle size measurement. ***Question:  What are the physical properties of such particles? Shape? Chemical composition? Structure?Answer: It is not only for "Particles" and physical properties vary.*** 
Question:  In addition, what fluids will be used as carriers? Water? Buffering? Chemical composition? Answer:  We will use a large variety of  fluids as carriers, most of systems could be multi-component and concentrations could be higher than 70%. ***Question:  Are size distributions of importance? Answer:  If it is particle size measurements, this issue would be important.  ***Question:  Will the unit examine fractions of separated samples?  Answer:  Not relevant to the specification.*** Question:  How will samples be produced? At what densities/concentrations?Answer:  A multiplexity of complex materials systems will be investigated.***Question:  Are only hydrodynamic sizes required? 
Answer:  NO.***Question:  Is the determination of rotational diffusion coefficients an objective? Answer:  No. ***Question:  What information is available at 5? that is unavailable at other angles?Answer:  According to the light scattering principle, small measurable, reliable angle provides larger probing length scale. Correspondingly, larger angle measurements give a smaller probing scale.  It is critical to have these capabilities so that we can ensure the precise and accurate measurements of large length scale structures. If an instrument company that can build an instrument performs at measurement angles less than 5 degree, it will be plus.  ***Question:  In this day and age of low stray light scattering instrumentation, what is the object of index matching fluids?Answer:  The stray light would affect the low angle measurements, when the measurable angle in the range of 5 to 10 degrees. ***Question:  What non-toxic fluids have a refractive index of 1.5 (typical glass)?Answer:    Oil ***Question:  Why is temperature limited to exactly 100? C? Zero C?  Why is NIST uninterested in electrical safety of the instrumentation it proposes to purchase?Answer:    This instrument is purchased for research purpose not for QC or for some routine practice. The temperature is not limited to "exactly" 100? C? Zero C? . We want a wide range of operational temperatures, the wider the better. Most of our systems may be prepared at temperatures higher than 100 C.  The temperature range specified in the proposal should be viewed as being the minimally acceptable range.***Question:  How much time is available for measurement?Answer:    Not relevant.   Fast and accurate measurements are always a plus!***Question:  Why does the proposed purchase refer to an instrument with such limited flexibility? Answer:    With all the specifications we requested, the required instrument has a great flexibility for our research.  Flexibility implies we can use and modify this instrument to our needs. ***

<SOLNBR>F08635-02-R-0001
<RESPDATE>061801
<CONTACT>Richard Boast, Contract Specialist, Phone (850)882-9103 EXT 566, Fax (850)882-8050, Email boast@eglin.af.mil
<DESC>This notice serves as a sources sought synopsis for the AMRAAM AIM-120 Lots 16-21 (FY02-07) production/sustainment program and software upgrade (SWUP) development.  The information in Block 10 is provided for identification and tracking of responses to this synopsis only.

A.  The Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) Joint Systems Program Office, in preparation for its 16th production run of Air Intercept Missile (AIM)-120 missiles, shall select one firm for Total System Performance Responsibility (TSPR) of the AIM-120 System which must meet the requirements of the AMRAAM Missile Performance Specifications (MPS).  TSPR is defined as the contractor's acceptance of responsibility to do what is necessary and sufficient to deliver, warrant, and support missiles that are affordable, combat capable, and readily available. Any solicitation/award would incorporate a Long Term Pricing Agreement (LTPA) for any/all supplies and services necessary for the production/sustainment of the AIM-120 missile. The solicitation/award will include a basic period (Lot 16/FY02), and five option periods (Lot 17/FY03, Lot 18/FY04, Lot 19/FY05, Lot 20/FY06 and Lot 21/FY07).  Specific production/sustainment requirements, in addition to the underlying TSPR concept, may include, but are not limited to: AIM-120C6 and AIM-120C7 missiles (USAF/USN), AIM-120C-5 missiles [Foreign Military Sales (FMS)], sustainment (including repair and a Service Life Prediction Program), associated spares, support/support items (i.e., program management/engineering/logistics/test support, support equipment, spares, (FMS) offset administration) and associated data maintenance). Total missile production is expected to be from a minimum of 200 up to a maximum of 1200 missiles per year. Deliveries: Lot 16/FY02 begins Oct 03 at a rate of approximately 110 missiles per month; Lots 17/FY03, 18/FY04, 19/FY05, 20/FY06, and 21/FY07 at rates of approximately 92 per month.   Sustainment requirements are anticipated to include a 1 lot repair capability that covers warranted missile and support item repair for each 12 month period.  Inasmuch as Raytheon Company, the current producer and sustainment provider of the AIM-120 missiles is in current production, the JSPO will not be able to provide government property/government special tooling/special test equipment to any prospective new source. Therefore the fulfillment of the supplies/services listed above requires substantial initial investment and an extended period of preparation for manufacture.  Anticipated date of letter of solicitation for (Lots 16 - 21) production and sustainment is on or about 01 Aug 01 ; date of closing response is on or about 15 Sep 01. This acquisition is contemplated sole source under authority of FAR 6.203-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements (10 USC 2304(c)(1)) to Raytheon Company, 1151 E Hermans Rd. P.O. Box 11337, Tucson, AZ 85734-1337.
The AMRAAM program has been identified as one of three Air Force Price Based Acquisition (PBA) Pilot Programs.  One PBA initiative undertaken by the Procuring Contracting Officer is a request for a waiver of the requirement to obtain (certified) cost or pricing data from Raytheon Company and its subcontractors for the production and sustainment of the AMRAAM AIM-120 missiles.

Should your firm desire subcontracting opportunities, contact Mr. Tom Gillman  (Raytheon Co.) at the above address or phone (520) 794-9794.

B.  In addition, one firm shall be selected to enter into a Software Upgrade Program (SWUP) for the AIM-120C-7.  This notice serves as the sources sought synopsis for the SWUP.  Firms interested in the SWUP portion of this synopsis must have the capability to design develop, integrate, and test improvements for production incorporation into the AIM-120C7 to maintain system effectiveness in future combat environments.  Candidate improvement areas include electronic protection, guidance, seeker, processor, propulsion, and other associated missile subsystems.  SWUP development is anticipated to occur in early FY03 and continue for a period commensurate with design complexity (approximately 36 months). Subject to funds availability, a potential solicitation date is estimated to be released in 
mid-FY02.  P3I Phase 1 and 2 were awarded to the former Hughes Missile Systems Co., with the former Raytheon Missile Systems Co as a major subcontractor. The two companies have since merged to form Raytheon Company.  The P3I Phase 3 development contract was awarded to Raytheon Company.  Respondents to the SWUP portion of this notice must address such factors as: a) Professional and engineering resources with sufficient knowledge of the technology and specific weapon system characteristics to design, develop, integrate, test and provide production ready improvements to the AMRAAM system in the absence of a data package, b) ability to identify and analyze potential impacts to the AMRAAM system, subsystems and platform interfaces resulting from SWUP improvements, c) ability to apply current or emerging air-to-air missile system, subsystems, and component technologies to the AMRAAM system to meet operational requirements, d) relevant experience with munitions and guided missile programs and performance as a systems contractor, e) availability/adequacy of special facilities required to perform in the technical areas under consideration, f) documentation of industry security clearance, and g) any other specific information as it pertains to this particular area of procurement that would enhance our consideration and evaluation of the information submitted.

<DESC>The National Weather Service/Office of Hydrologic Development located at Silver Spring, MD has the following requirement.  The period of performance is for a total of 3 years, 1 Base Year with 2 1-year Options.

Objectives:

There are two primary objectives:  (1) Develop innovative, operational, real-time rainfall analysis techniques using WSR-88D data that will generate ensembles of rainfall products that provide most-likely rainfall estimates and associated uncertainty information. The techniques should use WSR-88D data as their primary input and should not be dependent on the availability or density of rain gauge or satellite rainfall data. These techniques could be extensions of existing NWS radar-only techniques such as the PPS or could be new ones based on dual-polarized radar data. The techniques must be robust enough so that single-polarized reflectivity data and/or dual-polarized radar data could be used as input since both forms of radar data will be available from the WSR-88D in the near future. In either case, the proposed techniques must be efficient and robust enough to be viable in the
real-time operational environment of the NWS and must be able to be implemented within NWS WSR-88D computer systems and infrastructure. The procedures and products are expected to be validated against rain gauge data or other comparable rainfall sources in a variety of rainfall regimes across the topographically diverse U.S. in all four seasons.  (2) Develop innovative techniques based on human factors considerations to display this quantitative information to users that are both intuitive and informative, yet not overwhelming.

Deliverables:

First-year deliverables include a written report from the contractor proposing and evaluating one or more possible techniques for generating ensemble or probabilistic radar rainfall estimates. This report should include a review of existing NWS QPE techniques such as stated above to assure the contractor understands the scope of current capabilities. Semiannual progress reports are required.

If the proposed techniques are judged by the NWS to be operationally viable and scientifically valid after NWS review of the year-1 report, development of the techniques can proceed in the second year with availability of funding. Semiannual progress reports are required.

The final deliverable at the end of the third year with availability of funding will be an operational prototype algorithm, including software and documentation, that can be implemented within existing NWS systems. Semiannual progress reports are required.

The proposals will be evaluated based on the following factors:  Past Performance, Knowledge of real-time rainfall analysis techniques, Knowledge of display techniques, and cost.  All factors will be weighted equally.

If you are a interested responsible party that can produce the above solution, request you send an e-mail requesting a copy of the solicitation to the below Point of Contact.  The solicitation will be released about 5 days after the closing date of this announcement.

<SUBJECT>14 -- AMRAAM Air Intercept Missile (AIM)-120 Missile Program
<SOLNBR>F08635-02-R-0001
<RESPDATE>061801
<CONTACT>Richard Boast, Contract Specialist, Phone (850)882-3416 ext. 3259, Fax (850)882-2533, Email boast@eglin.af.mil - Ronald Foskey, Contract Specialist, Phone (850)882-9884 ext. 210, Fax (850)882-8425, Email foskey@eglin.af.mil
<DESC>This notice serves as a sources sought synopsis for the AMRAAM AIM-120 Lots 16-21 (FY02-07) production/sustainment program and software upgrade (SWUP) development.  The information in Block 10 is provided for identification and tracking of responses to this synopsis only.

A.  The Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) Joint Systems Program Office, in preparation for its 16th production run of Air Intercept Missile (AIM)-120 missiles, shall select one firm for Total System Performance Responsibility (TSPR) of the AIM-120 System which must meet the requirements of the AMRAAM Missile Performance Specifications (MPS).  TSPR is defined as the contractor's acceptance of responsibility to do what is necessary and sufficient to deliver, warrant, and support missiles that are affordable, combat capable, and readily available. Any solicitation/award would incorporate a Long Term Pricing Agreement (LTPA) for any/all supplies and services necessary for the production/sustainment of the AIM-120 missile. The solicitation/award will include a basic period (Lot 16/FY02), and five option periods (Lot 17/FY03, Lot 18/FY04, Lot 19/FY05, Lot 20/FY06 and Lot 21/FY07).  Specific production/sustainment requirements, in addition to the underlying TSPR concept, may include, but are not limited to: AIM-120C6 and AIM-120C7 missiles (USAF/USN), AIM-120C-5 missiles [Foreign Military Sales (FMS)], sustainment (including repair and a Service Life Prediction Program), associated spares, support/support items (i.e., program management/engineering/logistics/test support, support equipment, spares, (FMS) offset administration) and associated data maintenance). Total missile production is expected to be from a minimum of 200 up to a maximum of 1200 missiles per year. Deliveries: Lot 16/FY02 begins Oct 03 at a rate of approximately 110 missiles per month; Lots 17/FY03, 18/FY04, 19/FY05, 20/FY06, and 21/FY07 at rates of approximately 92 per month.   Sustainment requirements are anticipated to include a 1 lot repair capability that covers warranted missile and support item repair for each 12 month period.  Inasmuch as Raytheon Company, the current producer and sustainment provider of the AIM-120 missiles is in current production, the JSPO will not be able to provide government property/government special tooling/special test equipment to any prospective new source. Therefore the fulfillment of the supplies/services listed above requires substantial initial investment and an extended period of preparation for manufacture.  Anticipated date of letter of solicitation for (Lots 16 - 21) production and sustainment is on or about 01 Aug 01 ; date of closing response is on or about 15 Sep 01. This acquisition is contemplated sole source under authority of FAR 6.203-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements (10 USC 2304(c)(1)) to Raytheon Company, 1151 E Hermans Rd. P.O. Box 11337, Tucson, AZ 85734-1337.
The AMRAAM program has been identified as one of three Air Force Price Based Acquisition (PBA) Pilot Programs.  One PBA initiative undertaken by the Procuring Contracting Officer is a request for a waiver of the requirement to obtain (certified) cost or pricing data from Raytheon Company and its subcontractors for the production and sustainment of the AMRAAM AIM-120 missiles.

Should your firm desire subcontracting opportunities, contact Mr. Tom Gillman  (Raytheon Co.) at the above address or phone (520) 794-9794.

B.  In addition, one firm shall be selected to enter into a Software Upgrade Program (SWUP) for the AIM-120C-7.  This notice serves as the sources sought synopsis for the SWUP.  Firms interested in the SWUP portion of this synopsis must have the capability to design develop, integrate, and test improvements for production incorporation into the AIM-120C7 to maintain system effectiveness in future combat environments.  Candidate improvement areas include electronic protection, guidance, seeker, processor, propulsion, and other associated missile subsystems.  SWUP development is anticipated to occur in early FY03 and continue for a period commensurate with design complexity (approximately 36 months). Subject to funds availability, a potential solicitation date is estimated to be released in 
mid-FY02.  P3I Phase 1 and 2 were awarded to the former Hughes Missile Systems Co., with the former Raytheon Missile Systems Co as a major subcontractor. The two companies have since merged to form Raytheon Company.  The P3I Phase 3 development contract was awarded to Raytheon Company.  Respondents to the SWUP portion of this notice must address such factors as: a) Professional and engineering resources with sufficient knowledge of the technology and specific weapon system characteristics to design, develop, integrate, test and provide production ready improvements to the AMRAAM system in the absence of a data package, b) ability to identify and analyze potential impacts to the AMRAAM system, subsystems and platform interfaces resulting from SWUP improvements, c) ability to apply current or emerging air-to-air missile system, subsystems, and component technologies to the AMRAAM system to meet operational requirements, d) relevant experience with munitions and guided missile programs and performance as a systems contractor, e) availability/adequacy of special facilities required to perform in the technical areas under consideration, f) documentation of industry security clearance, and g) any other specific information as it pertains to this particular area of procurement that would enhance our consideration and evaluation of the information submitted. 

Any offerors and their product(s) must meet qualification requirements in order to be eligible for award. These acquisitions require the type knowledge that could only be gained by years of experience in applying skills to the specific AMRAAM missile design; any interested/prospective offeror must be able to meet the award/delivery dates (as appropriate) in order to guarantee no slip in production. The SWUP development acquisition may contain data that are subject to export control laws and regulations. Only contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Services Center (DLSC) shall be provided copies of the solicitation or other data subject to foreign disclosure restrictions.

<DESC>This sources sought notice does not constitute the solicitation of a proposal, authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract for the items has not been received and funds are not currently available. All letters of interest from potential sources will be reviewed and retained. The Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Newport, Newport, Rhode Island, seeks interested sources to accomplish the following initiatives: The US Navy?s Unmanned Undersea Vehicle (UUV) Master Plan [April 2000] recommended adopting a more modular approach toward design and construction of future UUVs, and establishing a set of standards to better integrate the various Navy UUV programs and capabilities and to help reduce UUV life-cycle costs. In keeping with these recommendations, the Navy?s UUV Executive Steering Group (ESG) has chartered a study effort to initiate the standardization of interfaces and modularity for future US Navy UUV programs. Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division, Newport RI has been designated as study team lead organization, and the study Core Team includes the Navy development organizations that represent the various Navy UUV product lines.. The product of this effort will be a government team study report in late calendar year 2002 that establishes recommendations on how to implement the path towards UUV modularity and standardization. It is anticipated that additional efforts will follow, and that industry will have continued opportunity to impact the ultimately adopted standards approach, including a long-term effort to be established through appropriate UUV industry organizations. 
In order to gain insight into commercial and defense industry trends that will enable sensible standards and modularity of UUV payloads, the Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division, Newport, RI seeks industry standards and concepts for Unmanned Undersea Vehicle (UUVs) mechanical, electrical and software/architecture interfaces. A matrix and corresponding description of the information sought is provided at the following web link: <http://www.npt.nuwc.navy.mil/uuv/>. The Government team is soliciting information on current UUV systems, interface standards used, plus commercial views on evolving trends, which will support and enable a future modular approach. Focus areas include a) internal UUV factors, b) vehicle function and payload sensor interface factors, and c) host platform interface factors. Input on test and evaluation and analysis of these systems is also requested. Interested parties may download the UUV Standards & Interfaces information matrix, and are requested to reply with completed information electronically by email to the following point of contact by 31 July 2002: NUWCDIVNPT Contracts Kevin Hughes HUGHESKJ@npt.nuwc.navy.mil. The information received will be used for government study team purposes only, and will not be publicly released as received. The Government team will conduct analysis of the aggregate information, and will utilize it to form recommendations for future approaches based both on the survey information and other information available to the study team. These initiatives will assist in the execution of the UUV Master Plan and its four signature capabilities: Maritime Reconnaissance, Undersea Search and Survey, Communication and Navigation Aids, and Submarine Track and Trail. The Master Plan may also evolve, adding additional core mission area capabilities as UUV programs mature, necessitating design growth potential and flexibility. For the purposes of focusing this effort, the following definition of a UUV is provided from the Navy?s UUV Master Plan, April 2000: "An unmanned undersea vehicle is defined as a self-propelled submersible whose operation is either fully autonomous (pre-programmed or real-time adaptive mission control) or under minimal supervisory control and is untethered with the possible exception of data links, such as fiber optic cables." 
This standards & interfaces study will be coordinated with the Navy?s UUV Program Office (PMS403) planning on the acquisition of a Mission Re-configurable UUV (MRUUV). It is anticipated that a draft set of standards for the initial MRUUV approach will be made available for industry review and comment under separate solicitation in FY03. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). There is no commitment on the part of the U.S. Navy to award a contract as a result of this request for information. Reference NUWCDIVNPT Control #025176 in any responses forwarded to this office. Our department no longer issues solicitations or amendments in paper form. Instead, they may be accessed at our web site http://www.npt.nuwc.navy.mil/contract/. We also provide electronic access in our Bid Room.

<SUBJECT>A -- Counter Space - Counter Surveillance and Reconnaissance System Industry Day
<DESC>The Advanced Systems Program Office's Mission Area Prime Integrating Contractor (MAPIC), TRW Inc., intends to hold an Industry Day to present its plans for the development of a Counter Surveillance and Reconnaissance System (CSRS).  The MAPIC will be the prime integration contractor for CSRS but will subcontract for its development to a prime development contractor.   The goal of Industry Day is to identify companies who are interested and highlight capabilities that will be necessary for competitive prime system development contractors or support contractors to the prime.  The MAPIC intends to competitively award, with government approval, and manage multiple subcontracts for the initial concept development phase.

The CSRS is part of the USSPACE Space Control Mission Area.  The objective of the CSRS program is to provide Joint field commanders with the capability to counter the threat imposed by adversarial space-based imaging sensors.  The intent of the CSRS program is to develop and deploy a tactical, transportable system that has the capability to temporarily deny space-based imagery data in any theater of operation, both CONUS and OCONUS.  The scope of the development contracts will be discussed at Industry Day.  The development timeline and the status of pertinent technologies will be reviewed.  

It is anticipated that TRW will issue an RFP for the initial phase in late summer of this year. All CSRS phases will require that contractors have facilities and personnel qualified and certified up to the DoD Top Secret level and also have the capability to design, develop, fabricate, test and integrate all phases of the system.  In addition, the contract will require access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI).

<SUBJECT>R -- Evaluation of Office on Women''s Health HIV/AIDS/STDs Programs
<DESC>The Office on Women's Health (OWH) through the Program Support Center, intend to award a twelve month Simplified Acquisition to a Contractor to perform professional services as described as follows:

The United States Department of Health and Human Services' Office on Women's Health (OWH) requires a Contractor to provide professional service in evaluation of OWH women and HIV/AIDS/STDs programs.  Primary intent is to identify strength and weaknesses of current programs and determine guidance measures for the future of OWH HIV/AIDS programs for women.

Period of Performance:  Date of award through August 29, 2003.

Background:  The Office on Women's Health (OWH) has as its mission the improvement of women's health across the life span by directing, developing, stimulating, and coordinating women's health research, health care services, and public and health professional education and training across the agencies and offices of the Department of Health and Human Services and with other government agencies, public and private organizations, and consumer and health care professional groups.  To that end, the OWH has established public/private partnerships to address critical women's health issues nationwide.  These include designing and implementing training and education programs to target groups; identifying information gaps and designing and developing educational materials to better respond to public, health care professional, and researcher needs on women's health issues; and disseminating educational products developed on women's health concerns.

In response to Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) efforts to focuso n the impact of HIV/AIDS in minority communities, in the year 1999 the OWH developed two programs;  The Incarcerated and Newly Released women with HIV/AIDS/STDs program and the Model Mentorship Program for Strengthening Organizational Capacity program.

The Incarcerated and Newly Released women with HIV/AIDS/STDs program includes models of the comprehensive HIV/AIDS services for incarcerated and newly released minority women living with HIV/AIDS/STDs.  The programs have been designed to focus on the important role of pre-release, discharge, and transition planning processes in linking women to health care services and/or support services, and/or addressing persistent gaps in health care and support services.

The Model Mentorship Program for Strengthening Organizational Capacity program includes model mentorship demonstration programs that have been developed and implemented by both minority health organizations and women's service organizations and community-based organizations.  The selected minority health organization offers technical assistance in the areas of administration and program management, business management, and any other areas of specialized training that community-based and women's service organizations identify to enhance their capacity to deliver HIV services to minority women living with HIV/AIDS.

In response to the growing numbers of women in the rural south who are testing positive for HIV, OWH has developed an additional initiative for HIV/AIDS and women living in the rural south.  This program is titled: Linking HIV/AIDS Primary and Secondary Prevention Education for At Risk Women and Women Living with HIV/AIDS in the Rural South.  This program includes collaboration with local health and/or social service providers to develop and implement a HIV/AIDS education and prevention program to provide accurate knowledge on preventing HIV among women living in the rural south.
