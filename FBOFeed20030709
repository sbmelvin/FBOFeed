To obtain a copy of the CD and be included on the planholder list, interested bidders must register on our website at www.usbr.gov/pn/contracts/construction.  Visit the website after July 10, 2003, to obtain further instructions about registering.  If you don't provide your DUNS (Data Universal Numbering System) and TIN (Taxpayer Identification Number) on the electronic registration form, we will not send the solicitation to you.  Telephone requests for the solicitation won't be accepted.   There is no charge for the first copy of the CD and $15 for each additional copy requested.  We reserve the right to issue the solicitation on paper if it becomes necessary.   The Office of Management and Budget has instructed all federal agencies to adopt use of the Central Contactor Registration system as a single, government-wide system for storing contractor procurement and payment information.  By October 1, 2003, a vendor must be registered in the CCR in order to receive contracts and purchase orders from most federal agencies, including the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation.  CCR is a self-service database.  Vendors register themselves and maintain their own information through the CCR web site. If not already registered, we encourage entities interested in USBR business to register in the system now, to avoid any disruption or loss of awards after the revised regulation takes effect.  To register or learn more about the CCR, go to:  www.ccr.gov/vendor.cfm.   All responsible sources may submit an offer, which will be considered by this agency.  This project is 100% set-aside for register HUB-Zone small businesses.  See Numbered Notes 26 and 27.

<DESC>Independent Local Area Augmentation System (LAAS) Benefits Analysis= =20 Single Source Justification The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in its evaluation of navigation s= ervices has concluded the use of satellite-based navigation systems is the = most effective and efficient source for civil navigation. The LAAS is an in= tegral part of the FAA=E2=80=99s transition from a=20 ground-based navigation and landing system to a satellite-based system.=20 To support the transition, the FAA awarded a contract to IBM on June 29, 20= 02, for an independent LAAS benefits analysis. The FAA intends to expand th= e scope of IBM=E2=80=99s original tasking to include a detailed analysis of=  the user baseline, incremental capabilities, societal benefits, and LAAS a= s an enabling technology. In accordance with AMS 3.2.2.4, Single Source Selection, the FAA intends to=  award IBM a single source contract to complete the independent LAAS Benefi= ts Analysis.  A decision milestone is scheduled in November 2004, to determ= ine whether to proceed to Phase II.  The FAA needs a completed analysis by = October 2004, as the analysis is critical to the decision. Completing the L= AAS Benefits Analysis on time is critical to minimizing program schedule ri= sk.  The FAA anticipates that the cost and time to complete the analysis wo= uld increase if another contractor is selected.=20 The FAA has decided to mitigate the risk of cost and schedule impact to the=  program by making a decision to single source the completion of the LAAS B= enefits Analysis. The FAA=E2=80=99s decision to single source the procureme= nt is based on the FAA=E2=80=99s need to mitigate the risks identified abov= e, to obtain the analysis in a timely manner to support schedule, and at a = reasonable cost. =20 IBM has demonstrated on the existing LAAS Benefits Analysis contract that i= t has the knowledge and resources to satisfy program requirements. IBM has = developed a large database of airline and airport operations, customized so= ftware necessary to perform the analyses, and has assembled staff with spec= ialized skills. This allows IBM to complete the independent LAAS Benefits A= nalysis within the time required and at a reasonable cost. =20 To avoid an unacceptable level of program risk and to maintain the FAA=E2= =80=99s program schedule at a reasonable cost, the FAA has determined it is=  in the best interest of the Government to award the contract on a single s= ource basis to IBM.  =20 This announcement is for informational purposes only and is not a request f= or competitive proposals.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for Pressure Control Data Correlation. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase Pressure Control Data Correlation from The Boeing Company, pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, which implements the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  Competition is impractical because: (a) This analytical support is a continuation of an Aerospace Industry Technology Program (AITP) studied under previous contractual agreements with McDonnell Douglas under Cooperative Agreement NCC8-61 and with The Boeing Company under Contract NAS8-39202; (b) Boeing has the unique knowledge and experience needed to perform this analysis since they have designed, engineered, manufactured and directed testing of the critical components of the test article through their previous agreements and contracts with NASA; (c) Boeing is the only organization in the United States capable of performing Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) correlations of existing liquid hydrogen (LH2) data and then applying the “anchored CFD modeling” to pressure control in zero gravity environments.  Boeing at Huntington Beach has established and maintained the capability to perform CFD analyses of cryogenic data applicable to orbital propulsion systems; (d) If a company other than Boeing were awarded this contract, in-house civil service manpower, delivery schedule, cost, and product quality would be impacted to such a degree that the effort would be rendered impractical.  In-house civil service (C.S.) effort would be required to compile, format, and convey detailed test hardware design and functional descriptions along with the 2,000 hours of test data.  C. S. manpower would also have to guide the contractor analyses conducted by personnel unfamiliar with the specific test hardware/data and unskilled in low gravity cryogenic propellant management. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 3:00 p.m. Central Standard Time on July 28, 2003.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

FS 1000 General Sampling Procedures
FS 2000 General Aqueous Sampling
FS 2200 Groundwater Sampling

The contractor also is required to maintain specific records for each sample collected and each field sampling event.  The minimum required records for field procedures are those listed under Chapter 62-160.240(2)(a) through (g) FAC.  The contractor shall provide a signed statement prior to award of this contract that the SOPs and record keeping requirements will be satisfied during the entire term of the contract.  Any changes to these requirements must be submitted, in writing, to the contracting officer and approved by MacDill AFB prior to implementation by the contractor.  

Samples shall be collected between the hours of 0730 and 1200 daily. The contractor shall inform the WWTP operator of his or her arrival so the operator may observe or inspect the work.  The contractor shall annotate arrival time, date, and types of samples taken each visit on the daily inspection checklist log located in the chlorine room at the WWTP.

The contractor shall provide sampling containers for each sample with the required preservatives, sampling materials, shipping labels, and chain-of- custody forms. All containers and preservatives provided by the contractor shall be new and free from contamination which could interfere with the analyses of the samples. 

The contractor shall provide for the delivery of materials and supplies necessary to perform the sampling from the contractor's laboratory facilities to MacDill AFB. The contractor also shall provide for the delivery of samples from MacDill AFB to the contractor's laboratory facility. Arrival of samples to the contractor's laboratory facility must occur within 4 hours from the time that the samples were taken by the contractor. The contractor shall also provide for the delivery of the analytical results and reports related to this contract to MacDill AFB as described in the Statement of Work.

Laboratory Analytical and Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC)
Requirements

In accordance with Chapter 62-160 FAC, the contracted laboratory shall hold Florida Department of Health Environmental Laboratory Certification Program (DOH ELCP) certification and submit proof of such certification prior to contract award.  Contractor must notify the contracting officer immediately if DOH ELCP certification is lost.

All laboratory analytical procedures, sample holding times, and QA/QC tests shall follow the National Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Conference (NELAC) standards as required by DOH ELCP.  The contractor shall provide valid, quantitative results for all analyses performed.  Results shall be summarized on result sheets for the parameters analyzed and, unless otherwise specified, all concentrations shall be reported in milligrams per liter (mg/L).  The contractor also shall provide all QA/QC test results required by NELAC and obtained in the course of analyzing MacDill AFB samples with the result sheets.  The result sheets shall include the certification and statement referred to below.

The minimum detection limit (MDL) for each test on the permit shall be as defined in the standard methods manual (most current edition).  For parameters where a detection limit is not listed, the contractor shall maintain detection limits at or below the applicable Florida Primary or Secondary Drinking Water Standards.

The contractor shall provide a written statement of certification guaranteeing that acceptable methods were performed for each parameter. This statement and certification of performance must include the method number or reference number employed by the contractor to obtain the concentrations or quantitations for each test. This statement and certification shall be signed by the laboratory supervisor and shall be provided with the sample data reports.

MacDill AFB and the appropriate laboratory command of the USAF reserves the right to visit and inspect all laboratory facilities and review all techniques used by the contractor in fulfilling the obligations of this contract.

Reporting Requirements and Points of Contact 

MacDill AFB must provide test results to FDEP and EPHC in accordance with the time frames listed in our permit. Therefore, time is of the essence when reporting results for laboratory test performed by the contractor.  The contractor shall perform all calculations necessary to obtain analytical results and report analytical results, sample data, and QA/QC documentation within 7 calendar days from sample collection (turnaround time).  For the effluent samples collected daily and analyzed for Total Suspended Solids and Fecal Coliform, the results shall be transmitted as soon as the tests are complete by fax to MacDill AFB via fax.   

Test results for the quarterly groundwater samples must be reported on FDEP Groundwater Monitoring Report (GWMR) forms.  The GWMR forms shall be submitted to MacDill AFB within 14 days from completing the laboratory analyses.  A sample copy of the GWMR is included in Exhibit D.  

The test results from the analyses, complete with all data, statements, certifications, QA/QC data, and the completed GWMRs shall be delivered to 6th Civil Engineer Squadron.

ADDITIONALLY REQUESTED SERVICES

Contractor shall be available within two hours of notification by MacDill personnel to perform any test that was missed during a sampling process. In addition, MacDill AAFB may, from time to time, request that the contractor perform additional field sampling and laboratory analysis not specified by this Statement of Work.  Contractor shall provide these additional services in accordance with the contract, if the contractor has the certifications to perform the work, at a price, turnaround, and report format that is negotiated at the time of the request.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent that WR-ALC anticipates issuing an engineering services task order against an existing Basic Ordering Agreement (F09603-02-G-0013) with Raytheon Company, Goleta CA (MC 06129).  This requirement is to develop and procure Fault Isolation System Tester (FIST) in support of the B-1B platform.  The FIST provides all loads and test functions required for flight line fault isolation testing of the ALE-50 Electronic Warfare System.  The FIST provides the warfighting maintainer with the capability to fault isolate AN/ALE-50(V)2 system failures on-aircraft in a safe environment in order to return the aircraft to full warfighting capability.  It enables the System Built-in-test functionality on the ground in absence of a loaded magazine (loaded magazines contain pyrotechnic devices along with classified decoys), as well as providing Stray Voltage test function and Stray current test functions, allowing weapons maintainers to know they are safe to load a magazine into the system.  There will be 4 EMD assets and 20 production assets.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  This acquisition may/does involve technology that has a military or space application.  The only US contractors who may participate are those that are certified and registered with DLSC (1-800-352-3572) and have a legitimate business purpose.  US contractors must submit a copy of their current, approved DD Form 2345 with their request for solicitation.  To request this certification write to the Commander, Defense Logistics Services Center, ATTN: DLSC-FEB, Federal Center, Battle Creek MI 49017-3084 and request a copy of Department of Defense Form 2345 or call DLSC at the above number.  The solicitation/data package will be mailed to the data custodian identified in block 3 of the DD Form 2345.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  MOU country sources must contact the Contracting Officer within 15 calendar days of the date of this synopsis notice to receive a copy of the solicitation at the time it is initially issued.  Issuance of the RFP will not be delayed to review requests from MOU country sources received after 15 days or from non-MOU country sources.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small-business set-aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).  Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.  However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.

<DESC>The U. S. Department of Agriculture intends to procure 2 D image analysis software from Nonlinear, Inc. or equal.  The software shall be capable of 1 - set-up parameters of all experiments quickly with little user-intervention(20 gels can be set-up for analysis in 5 minutes) 2 - employ an intelligent noise correction algorithym to enhance accuracy and consistency, 3 - employ a background subtraction method based on the whole image and that is independent of comparing image signal differences across spot detection boundaries, 4 - combine spot detection, image warping and matching algorithms to significantly reduce the amount of time needed for editing gels after analysis (12 hours per gel needed for editing using conventional software is reduced to approximately 30 minutes using Progenesis Discovery) and 5 - statistically validate spot measurements across a gel series, and measure if expression changes are real or artifacts of inherent gel variations.  Software packages shall include: 1. Progenesis Discovery Core Image Analysis license.  2.  3 Progenesis Editors (licenses).  3.  Manuals and training guides. 4. Installation, set up and training. 5.   1 year subscription to CoverWise Silver Support including software upgrades, on-line support, and discounted annual re-training. 6.  Pre-validation of sample data set - review and assess software performance on set of the end users gels.  The software shall be delivered FOB to the USDA, ARS, 1100 Robert E. Lee Blvd., New Orleans, Louisiana 70124.  An IFB will be issued on or about July 24, 2003.  These dates are tentative and will be specified in the IFB package.  All requests must be submitted in writing, faxed to (601) 686-5373 or by electronic mail to: TKRUTZ@ARS.USDA.GOV.  No calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to negotiate and award a contract modification for additional Tactical Tomahawk Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) missiles.  Contract award is planned for the fourth quarter fiscal year 2003.  This requirement includes the hardware manufacture of All-Up-Round Tactical Tomahawk (Block IV) missiles and related equipment and services.  The contract may include hardware manufacturing and testing; sustaining engineering; non-recurring and recurring engineering, logistics tasks, obsolescence, All-Up-Round components and the repair of Government Furnished Equipment, Special Tooling and Special Test Equipment; procurement of Range Safety Systems; Product Verification Testing and Functional Ground Testing; Guidance Test Sets and Spares, support, maintenance and repair; refurbishment of containers and capsules.  NAVAIR intends to award this effort to Raytheon Systems Company (RSC), P.O. Box 11337, Tucson, AZ 85734-1337.  Since 1994, RSC has been the sole developer, designer, and manufacturer for the TWS.  RSC solely possesses the current configuration and manufacturing data for the Tactical Tomahawk missile, and is the only source capable of meeting Fleet requirements.  Because a detailed knowledge and expertise of the Tactical Tomahawk missile is required to conduct tasking under this contract, RSC is the only source capable of accomplishing this requirement in the required timeframe and without duplication of costs.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with The Boeing Company Phantom Works Southern California for a long duration orbital vehicle (LDOV) technology demonstrator under the Advanced Technology Flight Demonstration Vehicle (X-37) Project. The X-37 project is for unique specialized equipment to test and demonstrate advanced technologies in support of NASA's Space Launch Initiative (SLI).  Boeing is currently on contract for LDOV design and development work, which has progressed to a point whereby the Agency requires replacement of the short duration orbital vehicle effort currently on contract with a long duration orbital vehicle. Currently, the Government and Boeing have invested approximately $150 million dollars toward the orbital vehicle design and development effort, which would not be recovered through re-competition.   NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the LDOV from Boeing as the only known source which can meet Agency requirements pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii) for follow-on Agency requirements. Boeing’s and the cumulative Governmental funding of the X-37 design and development, along with the follow-on nature of this procurement action, fulfills the exception to competition regarding duplicative costs to the Government pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii)(A).  It should be noted that this action does not include the acquisition of launch services for the X-37 project. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. See note 22.    Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on July 24, 2003.	Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.   An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 54171   The U.S. Environmental  Protection  Agency (EPA) , Office of Research and Development (ORD), is seeking a qualified contractor who can provide a facility that must have electroless nickel plating, rack nickel plating with both air and eductor mixing and nickel barrel plating. Nickel emissions from electroplating operations are of concern to the EPA.  Air emission estimation for electroplating is described in EPA's  AP42 regulation.  As part of these regulations, the AP42 states: "Emissions from plating operations other than chromium electroplating can be  estimated using the emission factors and operating parameters for chromium electroplating". Based on this regulation, EPA developed a computer based Metal Finishing Facility Risk Screening Tool (MFFRST) which estimates emissions from electroplating operations.  The tool is believed to be very  accurate for chromium emissions, however, there is a need to validate air emissions for other metals such as nickel.  This project will require gathering nickel emission data from electroplating facilities. Contractor must devise a system to feed outside air into the plating area to obtain "Clean"  background air for the 306A sampling protocol.  The contractor shall obtain three data points using 306A sampling protocol for the various nickel processes.  Contractor must have significant proctical experience with electroplating operations.  Contractor must be able to compare the actual  emissions with the theoretical emissions predicted by the MFFRST tool.  The contractor's principal investigator shall be a Certified Electrofinisher (CEF) as determined by the American Electroplaters and Surface Finishers (AESF) Society. This is a SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.  This procurement will  be processed using full and open competition under FAR PART 13, Simplified Acquisition Prodcedures.  The applicable NAICS Code  is 54171.  The EPA intends to issue a Request for Quote (RFQ)  on or about the June 24, 2003.  All request for quotations must be in not later than 15 days from the date  of this submission or June 23, 2003, to receive an RFQ.   NO TELEPHONE REQUEST WILL BE ACCEPTED. Send in RFQ to U.S. EPA, Attn:  Barbara Curtiss, Ref No. CSV025, 26 W. Martin Luther king Drive, Cincinnati, Ohio 45268 or fax to same at 513-487-2109 or e-mail to curtiss.barbara@epa.gov

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

NAICS CODE:  541360  1. CONTRACT INFORMATION: The proposed services will be obtained by a negotiated Firm Fixed Price Contract(s). It is anticipated that initially one contract will be selected for the Louisville District and one contract for the Pittsburgh District.  A third contract may also be awarded within one year from responses to this request.  That award would be at the discretion of the government.  These individual contracts may be used to provide services for various Civil/military projects associated with programs supporting the Great Lakes and Rivers Division mission boundaries. The total contract value will not exceed $3,000,000.  Work will be issued by negotiated firm-fixed-price or labor-hour task orders not to exceed $1,000,000.  If multiple contracts are avail able for a District, the contracting officer will consider the following factors in deciding which contractor will be selected to negotiate an order: performance and quality of deliverables under the current contract, current capacity to accomplish the ord er in the required time, uniquely specialized experience, and equitable distribution of work among contractors. The top ranked firm will be awarded the first contract. If necessary, secondary selection criteria (f-h listed below) will be used as a tiebreak er among technically equal firms.  To be eligible for award, a firm must be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Registrar via the CCR Internet site at: http://ccr.edi.disa.mil, or by contacting the DoD Electronic Commerce Informatio n Center at 1-800-334-3414.

On Clin Item 0103 (X2580A, 400MHz CPU) Could you please find out if they want mirrored cache or non-mirrored cache of this item.  

Either one is fine.

Item (0113) appears to be two different parts, do you want them quoted as one item?

We just want a GBIC, part number #X6371A. 

line Item   Question  100 Do you need a rackmount or deskside system.

Rackmount.

107	 what version of Solaris do you need 8 or 9.

Not necessary. We will be running an older version, 2.5.

0110  On the Netra st D130 do you need the AC version or DC
version.

Normal wall outlet. I’m assuming this would be AC.

0113 Line item has two items X6731A GBIC FC-AL module and X3508A Type 6 Country Kit.

 From my draft copy I only see one line per item. Perhaps this is a typo on the final draft.

0119  What is included in the Ultra 2 Package. (Is this the same  as the Sun Ultra2 single 300Mhz CPU,512MB memory, dual 4.2GB disks and a 10/100 ethernet)

This CLIN is 120 on the draft. Yes, that is the configuration.

Can you provide us with a system configuration (integration list) for each of the Sun Systems and do you need Solaris software installed on the systems.

 I’ll try to get one before the end of the week, but I’ll be on leave until next week.

<DESC>It is the intent of National Library of Medicine (NLM) to negotiate on a sole source basis from the University of Maryland Health Sciences and Human Services Library, Baltimore, MD, to procure offsite storage and collection access services for the History of Medicine Division's Archives and Modern Manuscripts program.  The purchase order term will be August 1, 2003 through July 31, 2004 with options for two(2) successive one-year periods. The University of Maryland-Baltimore Health Sciences and Human Services Library originated in 1813.  With an eye toward mastering the accelerated demands of the information future, the newly constructed Health Sciences and Human Services Library opened in 1998 in an unprecedented, multi-functional, comprehensive library/information services facility.  It also serves as the Regional Medical Library for the Southeastern/Atlantic Region, one example of its close administrative ties to the NLM.  The new Health Sciences and Human Services Library at the University of Maryland is one of the most sophisticated library/information technology centers in the country-it is also the largest medical library on the East Coast.  The 190,000-square-foot building serves the University's health and human services professional campus, a specialized training ground for physicians, dentists, pharmacists, lawyers, and nurses. A heavily computer-driven building, the new facility merges the traditional library with the Computer Science Department of the University.  Other components of the building include administrative offices, classrooms, computer laboratories, and demonstration rooms, as well as display and storage space for the University's collection of rare and historical medical books, and a large meeting and special events room.  The library offers secure underground storage space with archival quality compact shelving.  The space is climate controlled and access is limited to 3 full-time library staffers.  An environmental survey was conducted by NLM archives and modern manuscripts and preservation section staff and the facilities met or exceeded our specifications.  The library offers processing workspace within the storage area itself and a second fully equipped workstation within its general administrative office space.  The facility is managed by a full time library staffer who will be the main point of contact for the project officer.  Located within 50 miles of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) campus in downtown Baltimore, its close proximity will facilitate transporting materials from NLM, onsite access by the project officer, and communication with University of Maryland facilities management and senior administrative staff.  The proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 13 - Simplified Acquisitions.  This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the NLM.  Firms interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide service as specified above.  Responses must be in writing and must be received in this office within fifteen (15) calendar days from publication date of this notice, and must include pricing information and meet the criteria requirement.  Inquires regarding this procurement may be made to the National Library of Medicine, Office of Acquisitions Management, 8600 Rockville Pike, Building 38A, Room B1N20, Bethesda, Maryland 20894, Attention: Uyen H. Phuong, Lead Purchasing Agent, on (301) 496-6127.  Fax requests WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.

The Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (BCBP) is the guardian of our Nations borders.  This makes BCBP Inspectors the first line of defense against organizations attempting to smuggle Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD), specifically radioactive materials.  Because of the catastrophic consequences that could result if this illicit material ever entered the country, it is of paramount urgency that BCBP acquire and equip its personnel with Personnel Radiation Detectors (PRD) that will be used for alerting, locating and interdicting radioactive materials, especially nuclear-related materials.  The PRD is a small pager-like device worn on the belt of Inspectors and shall be manufactured, operated and logistically supported to the following specifications:

Manufacturing Requirements:
&#61623; Manufactured to meet ANSI standard N42.32-2003
&#61623; Contain a self check mode to verify operation
&#61623; Weigh 14 ounces or less and not exceed 64 cubic inches
&#61623; Housing constructed so as to allow the unit to function correctly after a 5-foot drop
&#61623; Visual enunciators to provide distinction alerts and a level of intensity readout
&#61623; Contain an automatic shelf-check with performs and intern diagnostic check
&#61623; Contain tactile, visual and audible alarms
&#61623; Internal mechanism that allows for periodic alarm threshold adjustment
&#61623; Contain an internal power protection circuit to protect the electronic components
&#61623; Produce units that detect gamma radiation only
&#61623; Produce units that detect both gamma and neutron radiation simultaneously
&#61623; Apply unique markings specific to each unit (i.e. serial number)

Operating Requirements
&#61623; Integration time shall be no more than two (2) seconds
&#61623; Withstand temps between -22°F  and 122°F and 95% humidity at 95°F 
&#61623; Unaffected and operate correctly (shall not alarm) when subject to radio frequency electromagnetic fields up to 10 Volts/meter time-averaged field strength at frequencies from 20 MHz to 1 GHz.  The PRD shall be unaffected when in static magnetic fields of 1 mTesla  ( 10 gauss)
&#61623; The PRD electronics shall induce less noise than would result in one false alarm per day  (8-hour period) in a background field of 10 microrem/hour with an Alarm Threshold of 30 microrem/hour.  (Calibrated with 662 keV gamma photons.)  
&#61623; Detect gamma ray photons with energies as low as 45 keV  
&#61623; Detect neutrons with a range of energy between thermal energies (0.04 eV) and  1 MeV (when applicable)
&#61623; Sensitivity greater than 1.5 counts per second per microrem/hour calibrated for 662 keV gamma photons due to 137Cs 
&#61623; Neutron detection sensitivity of 0.5 counts/second per neutron/sec/cm2   

Logistics Support requirements
&#61623; Develop a support strategy
&#61623; Develop operator training
&#61623; Develop and document a certified Quality Assurance (QA) Program
&#61623; Develop an approved factory acceptance test plan
&#61623; Develop a program to track each unit through shipping and maintenance cycles 
&#61623; Deliver units with minute failure rates that are ready to use upon delivery

Because of the urgency and potential consequences, it is paramount that the technology be deployed as quickly as possible.  With that said, BCBP will require an expeditious delivery schedule that can provide several hundred units delivered per month, meeting the aforementioned requirements, within the timeframe of several months.  In addition, the quality of the PRD must leave them free from defect and allow for instant deployment upon reaching the delivery location. Delivery will commence 90 days following contract award and offerors shall have the capability to provide the specified monthly quantities within this timeframe. Due to the urgency of the deployment, all proposed PRD units must be ready for testing by BCBP by the proposal due date.  It is BCBP's intent to consider only COTS items and not those units still in a developmental status.  Lastly, because of current events, this deployment is and will be under the close scrutiny of Congress and the public.

<SUBJECT>R -- Evaluation of the Private Screening Pilot Airports
<SOLNBR>DTSA20-03-Q-01877
<CONTACT>Heather Morvant, Contract Administrator, Phone 571.227.1592, Fax 571.227.2913, Email heather.morvant@tsa.dot.gov
<DESC>Evaluation of Private Screening Pilot Airports//


I. Introduction:

A. ATSA Requirements:
On November 19, 2001, the President signed into law the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA), which, among other things, established the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). This Act established a series of challenging but critically important milestones toward achieving a secure air travel system.  

One of ATSA’s most significant mandates charged TSA with the task of federalizing security operations at our nation’s commercial airports within one year following passage of the Act (November 19, 2002).  However, in addition to this mandate, Section 108 of the ATSA legislation stipulated that up to five commercial airports retain private screening personnel with oversight by TSA.  In accordance with ATSA, the TSA chose five airports to represent different airport categories in a pilot project of private security screening.

The result is the creation of a potentially valuable control group by which TSA can view federal screener performance in relation to private screener performance.  ATSA did not identify specific metrics for measuring the performance or success of private screeners.//

B. Requirements:
TSA seeks to implement a sound process for measuring the performance of federal versus non-federal screeners for the following reasons:  

·	TSA seeks an efficient means of deploying resources while maintaining a high level of security.  An effective evaluation process will provide guidance on private versus federal security and associated cost requirements for TSA executives, the Administration, Congress and the nation’s taxpayers.  
·	As indicated above, under ATSA a key criterion for determining whether an airport can use private screeners is that the level of screening services are equal or greater than those provided by the Federal Government. 
·	TSA is required to provide reports to OMB on private screener performance
·	TSA wishes to be able to accurately and articulately respond to questions and inquiries from policy makers and the general public regarding the security and efficiency implications of private versus federal security screening operations.    

Therefore, the TSA’s objective is to retain the services of a qualified and capable evaluator to implement a fair and impartial process for analyzing private and federal screener performance.//


II. Request:

The results of the evaluation of private vs. federal screening will have a high level of impact within TSA, and is likely to have a high level of visibility externally, particularly in the policy-making arenas.  It is likely to play an important role in any debate over whether airport screening should be federally run or privately run.  To ensure that the evaluation is fair and impartial, the TSA intends to retain the services of a qualified and capable external evaluator.

TSA expects questions and possible challenges related to the comparison of federal versus private screening airports.  The evaluation by an external contractor should anticipate probable lines of questioning from Congressional and Administrative oversight (such as GAO and OMB), airport authorities, airline community, private security companies, and internal TSA and Department of Homeland Security stakeholders./

The TSA requests that companies interested in submitting a quote UNDER THE GSA MOBIS SCHEDULE now submit a capability statement not to exceed ten (10) pages for TSA’s review.  The capability statement should address the following evaluation criteria:

1.	The professional reputation and public recognition held by the prospective evaluator as evidenced by documentation such as letters of commendation or awards.  Such documentation will not count towards the ten-page limitation.
2.	Possible methods for approaching the problem that demonstrate the prospective evaluator’s thought leadership and area expertise
3.	Examples of deliverables of past performance that illustrate the prospective evaluator’s ability to develop a meaningful evaluation structure through analysis of metrics
4.	Examples of deliverables of past performance that illustrate the prospective evaluator’s ability to develop thoughtful recommendations and manage strategic implications.

Prospective offerors will be rated acceptable or unacceptable based on the above criteria.

Please identify your GSA MOBIS schedule number.  Do not include any cost information in the submission.

The statement should be sent to Heather Morvant (phone 571-227-1592), via email at hmorvant@dhs.gov, or via facsimile at 571-227-1948 not later than July 18, 2003 at 12:00 p.m. (noon) EST.

<DESC>RESEARCH PROGRAM:  The solicitation number is F33601-03-T-0173.  The proposed contract is for performance period from 17 Jul 03 – 16 Jul 04.  The government  intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of  FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) and FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii).  The proposed source is Dr.  Victor Perel, Dayton, OH.  The government anticipates a sole source award to  Dr. Perel for planning, organizing and conducting a research program directed  to improving the understanding of the method for detecting delamination of  composite beams using MEMS devices.  The contractor will develop algorithms to  determine the damage within materials under external loads using a finite  method.  This research will be performed at the Air Force Institute of  Technology (AFIT), Wright-Patterson AFB OH. A sole source award is anticipated  because Dr. Perel is currently performing this research and, therefore, a  significant loss of time and money would result from bringing a new contractor  up to the level of performance of Dr. Perel.  This notice of intent is not a  request for competitive quotations; however, any quotation received within five  (5) days of the issuance of this notice will be considered by the government.   A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based  upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the  government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the  purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Any  quotations should be faxed to Helen Williams, 88 ABW/PKSB, 937-257-3926, or e- mailed to Helen.Williams@wpafb.af.mil no later than 14 Jul 03.

<DESC>The 11th CONS/LGCN, Bolling AFB, DC, is seeking qualified sources capable of providing the following services for the purpose of developing a source list for a potential commercial procurement entitled “Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTs) Electronics Cost Model”, in support of The Air Force Cost Analysis Agency (AFCAA).  The state-of-the-art COTs electronics cost model will provide the government the price of procuring various quantities of a variety of commercial electronic equipment based on technical performance characteristics, using validated price quotations (in addition to, if not to the exclusion of catalog pricing) from COTs equipment manufacturers.  The government will evaluate the capability statements based on their ability to meet the specification for providing an existing state of the art COTs electronics cost model.  A state-of-the-art COTs electronics cost model will have the following features:  1. Cost Estimating Relationships (CER) shall cover in some form, a.  Data and Signal Processor boards, b. Memory boards, c.  Analog-to-Digital and Digital-to-Analog boards, d.  Receiver boards, e.  Waveform/Signal Generator boards, f.  Digital parallel input/output boards, g.  Storage Devices, h.  Power supplies, i.  Backplanes, j.  Enclosures, k.  Box Integration, l.  Server’s, m.  Workstations, n.  Routers, Hubs, and Switches.  2. For each cost estimating relationship, the CER will include, where appropriate, measures of performance using metrics accepted in the electronic industry, physical dimensions and quantities, memory size, environmental constraints, and maturity of the product line. Performance metrics depend on the object the CER estimates, but examples might include, but are not restricted or limited to, industry benchmark specifications, processor speed, bandwidth, stability, and samples per second. Physical dimensions also depend on the object, but may include, but are not limited to area, volume, and number of processor chips. The model shall identify as independent variables environmental constraints using military standards and specifications that discussed in the model documentation. Examples of environmental factors may include, but are not restricted or limited to, shock, vibration, temperature range, and nuclear environments. Finally, the data set should include, where appropriate, the original introduction date for the object data point. Because of the large number of degrees of freedom associated with COTs electronics data sets, a state-of-the-art electronics cost model may include for some CERs well over a dozen independent and dummy variables (consistent with econometric or advanced tistical linear modeling) to estimate the dependent variable (i.e. price) for a single CER.  3. Each data point shall be available to the government for review, analysis, and replication of each CER.  4. The government shall be able to view and directly use each and all of the cost estimating relationships associated with the model.  5. The contractor’s existing cost model will have documentation that allows, with the contractor’s data set, the government analyst to replicate the CER from the source data.  6. Given the size of the COTs electronics industry, the government expects contractor’s existing model to have CERs for commonly available boards using a minimum of several hundred boards from an existing database of cost and technical data. The database in its entirety, including both cost and technical data, must be available to the government for further analysis and replication of CERs.  7. The model will have an existing electronic interface that will allow the user to provide inputs for the dependent variables and receive a cost forecast based on the cost estimating relationship along with, at minimum, an estimate mean, median, lower bound, and upper bound.  8. The contractor will have the technical expertise necessary to identify, explain, and document performance and physical cost drivers. The documentation of the contractor’s existing model will have a description of the COTs component the CER estimates and the cost drivers associated with the CER.  The government is seeking to further develop existing models instead of developing new ones; the government expects the contractor to currently have full documentation for the existing model, including a technical manual that explains documents for each CER and how the contractor developed it. The description shall include a detailed description of the board estimated by the CER, a detailed description of each of the dependent variables, the CER itself along with the summary statistics. The description shall further include how the contractor collected and normalized the data used in developing the CER. All data sets used in development of the CER will be available in their entirety for the government to review, analyze, and verify the CERs.  Request that contractors interested and capable of performing these functions submit evidence of such and include the following information; name and address of company, company point of contact, telephone number, fax number and email addresses, and identify if business is large, small, disadvantage, HUBZONE, woman-owned or 8(a).  Capability statements must be clear and concise and submitted to the points of contact listed no later than 08 Aug 2003.  Please limit capability statements to ten pages and include, at a minimum: 1) Contract references in the past five years relevant to the requirement – including contract number, agency supported, whether or not you were a prime or subcontractor, period of performance, final contract value and brief description of the effort.  2) Company information:  annual sales history, locations services performed, DUNS number, CAGE Code and Tax ID Number.  For purposes of the Request for Information (RFI), the NAICS code is 541519, size standard, $21,000,000.00.  Contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) to do business with the Government.  Registration in CCR can be done at www.ccr.gov.  Preferred method of submissions is by electronic mail, however, facsimile submissions are acceptable (202-767-7814).

<OFFADD>NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center, Code 210.M, Greenbelt, MD  20771
<SUBJECT>A--REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) FOR MULTI-DISCIPLINARY ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY SERVICES (METS)
<DESC>NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) contract for Multi-Disciplinary Engineering and Development Services (MEDS) was established to provide engineering and related services for the study, design, development, fabrication, integration, testing, verification, and operations of space flight and ground system hardware software, including development and validation of new technologies to enable future science missions.  The MEDS contract is due to expire in April 2004, and acquisition planning is underway for follow-on efforts. The current MEDS contract is a Cost-Plus-Incentive-Fee, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type with a maximum contract value of approximately $275 million and was awarded competitively as an 8A set-aside.  Future projections and trends indicate that the magnitude of potential work for the upcoming 5 years could well exceed this current value by more than double.  Therefore, several options and alternatives are being considered.  The intent of this Request for Information (RFI) is to share with industry our current plans and considerations and solicit feedback.  We refer to the follow-on activity as Multi-Disciplinary Engineering and Technology Services (METS).   GSFC plans to compete and award two separate 8A contracts, with a proposed division of work separating pre-formulation, formulation, and research/technology services from implementation and parts/materials program services.  There are specific functions, such as, Project Management and Systems Engineering, that would still be required in both planned contracts.  In order to assist you in reviewing this debundling of requirements, we are providing a single Statement of Work, similar to that contained in the current MEDS contract with updates, along with a matrix indicating the Major Function or Responsibility of the two planned contracts.  Functions that are contained in both areas are also designated.  We are particularly interested in your feedback on the divisions indicated and would appreciate comments and/or suggestions.   GSFC also plans to award both contracts as Cost-Plus-Award-Fee, IDIQ.  We are considering a single Request for Proposal, designating separate work packages for the two distinct efforts, with a single Source Evaluation Board.	 Contractors would be allowed to propose separately on both packages.  However, a single contractor may only receive one contract award, either for the pre-formulation, formulation, and research technology or for the implementation and parts/materials program.	 Where possible and appropriate, offerors would only be required to submit a single set of data; for example, Representations and Certifications.	Pros and cons to this single RFP approach are still being considered, and your feedback in this area would also be appreciated. The NAIC for both requirements is 541710, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences, and the size standard is 1,000 employees. Our intent is to consider all comments in our planning deliberations, therefore, it would be most helpful if your feedback were provided to Ms. Cynthia Tart, Code 210.M, email address:  Cynthia.J.Tart@nasa.gov no later than July 24, 2003.  We anticipate at least one additional RFI posting prior to release of a draft RFP(s).  We do not intend to post comments received.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to award on a sole source basis, a cost plus fixed fee award to Actuarial Research Corporation (ARC) to perform ad hoc requests received by the Office of the Actuary which require actuarial estimates.  These include certain workload estimates, legislative proposals, regulatory estimates and administration initiatives.  These ad hoc estimates will be Part I of the proposed contract.

These models have been used extensively in the past but need to be expanded to better reflect the rapidly changing health care environment.  It is in the best interests of CMS to solicit and negotiate a sole-source contract with ARC pursuant to 41 USC 253(c)(1) for the 12 month contract, with provision for four option years.  The deliverables and associated completion dates will be identified in each work request.   Interested parties who believe they can provide the required services are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response demonstrating an ability to assume the above duties.  Any written response must be received no later than 15 days after publication of the synopsis.  All responsive sources shall submit their qualifications in writing to be considered responsive.  A request for solicitation will not be considered an affirmative response.  All questions and responses shall be in writing.  No telephonic or faxed requests will be honored.  See Note 22.

This solicitation and any resulting negotiation of a contract to perform these services are part of an Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76 Streamlined Cost Comparison Study, the purpose of which is to determine the most cost effective method of providing these services. The study is being conducted in accordance with streamlined competition procedures described in the revised OMB Circular A-76, dated May 29, 2003. Deviations from the revised circular are expected to be authorized by OMB in order to allow the retention of certain cost rules and procedures that were in effect prior to the issuance of the revised circular. Currently, Government personnel provide these services. Duties include gathering resource data to assist landowners in identifying resource conservation needs, assisting in the development of basic conservation plans with landowners to address resource concerns, assisting landowners with the design, layout, and inspection of completed conservation practices, developing land treatment contracts utilizing existing USDA and other federal, state, and local cost-share programs and providing annual follow-up on existing contracts.  Assistance provided will include working cooperatively with the local NRCS field office staff, local conservation district, private organizations, and other federal, state, and local partner agencies.
