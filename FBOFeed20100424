<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to include the solicitation, and all attachments.&nbsp; Offerors are instructed to read the solicitation in its entirety and comply with all terms and conditions.&nbsp; The basis for award for this requirement is Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (see solicitation for complete details).<br /><br /><br />The Government intends to solicit an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) with a basic period of performance of one (1) base year (one (1) calendar year) with two(2) 6-month option periods for Airfield Contruction and Repair functions at Joint Base Balad, Iraq. The contractor shall provide all plant, labor, supervision, equipment, materials, transportation, and perform all operations necessary to provide airfield construction and repair functions to include, but not limited to, rubber removal, concrete slab replacement, reseal pavement joint(s), partial depth spall repair, full depth spall repair, crack sealing, joint sealing, and airfield marking/striping.
<p>The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this acquisition is 237310. Basis of award will be Performance Price Tradeoff (PPT) with technical evaluation factors. A competitive best value source selection will be conducted in which the competing offerors' past performance history, and response to the Technical Evaluation criteria, when combined, will be evaluated on a basis significantly more important than cost/price considerations. The resultant award will be a firm fixed price construction contract. The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the low offeror if the offer is judged to provide the overall best value to the Government. All eligible and responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>The estimated magnitude of this project, to include all option periods, is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.</p>
<p>Anticipated issue date for the solicitation is within 30 days after issuance of this notice and can be accessed at the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at www.fbo.gov.</p>
<p>Potential offerors are responsible for monitoring the website for the release of the solicitation package and updated information. The government will not provide copies of the solicitation, blueprints, specifications or a plan holder's list. Telephone requests for information will not be allowed and all technical questions regarding the solicitation must be emailed to ryan.battad@iraq.centcom.mil with a courtesy copy to jennifer.pollard@iraq.centcom.mil. This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract, it does not restrict the Government in its ultimate acquisition approach, nor does it obligate the Government to pay for any proposal preparation costs.</p>
