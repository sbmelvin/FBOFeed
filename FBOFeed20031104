<DESC>Notice of Intent:  Pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements", the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM)-Center for Federal Investigative Services (CFIS) is planning to issue a sole-source Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) to Iron Mountain/National Underground Storage (IM/NUS) for possible future requirements for renovations, changes, and repairs to existing facility structures and space. This BPA will consist of work not to exceed $2,500 per job.  OPM-CFIS intends to award this agreement for one year with the option to extend the agreement for an additional year.  IM/NUS owns the mine facility from which OPM-CFIS operates and possesses the expertise to renovate and repair unique space within its underground atmosphere.  Additionally IM/NUS possesses the unique knowledge of mine safety requirments in relationship to the underground infastructure and alterations of such structures.  IM/NUS is the only known source to provide the services required by the agency with the in-depth knowledge of critical structural tolerances, electrical/power capabilities, HVAC requirements, and safety issues within the underground facility.  Therefore, OPM-CFIS deems it appropriate to award a BPA for these services on other than a full and open competitive basis.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS, NOR DOES IT REPRESENT A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR COSTS INCURRED IN THE PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF DATA OR ANY OTHER COSTS INCURRED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  Interested parties having all the capabilities to perform the services described above are requested to submit capability statements, limited to not more than 10 pages, to be received within 15 days of publication of this  announcement.  Notice to:  U.S. OPM-CFIS, 1137 Branchton Rd., P.O. Box 618, Boyers, PA  16018-0618., Attn:  Mr. Randy Melichar, (724)794-5612, Fax = 724-794-1152, e-mail = rlmelich@opm.gov.

<DESC>The Coast Guard intends to procure on a sole source basis NLETS User Fees and Line Charges for the period 1 October 2003 through 30 September 2003. The National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System (NLETS) is a sophisticated computer-controlled message switching network linking local, state, and federal agencies together for the purpose of information exchange. It is the only national system which provides state and local law enforcement with the capability to exchange free-form criminal justice related information interstate. The system is operated and controlled by the states. Every stat is a member. NLETS provides the U.S. Coast Guard law enforcement units with centralized access to Federal, State, and Local law enforcement databases. The service is part of an existing U.s. coast Guard MISLE system. NLETS is currently the only approved network of its kind to provide information from the states. The alternative would be to set-up communications and database protocols with every federal, state, and local law enforcement agency. Other firms who can furnish these user fees and line charges are invited to submit clear and convincing data substantiating their capability to furnsih the entire requirement. Vendors failing to provide complete information for an accurate comparison will not be considered.

Proposals may be submitted in any, all, or any combination thereof, of the following technical topic areas:  (1) Range and Flight Demonstration Systems Integration (2) Technology Maturation, to include the following: (a) Optical Channel Obscuration Mitigation (i.e. transmission through clouds); (b) Common/Combined FSO/RF aperture; (c) Compact Optical Beam Steering; (d) Hybrid (FSO & RF) Router Technology.  NOTE:  The principal focus of this BAA will be on the Optical & RF Combined Link Experiment (ORCLE), identified as Technical Topic Area (1) above.  However, Proposers may, and are encouraged to, respond to any, all, or any combination thereof, of the Technical Topic Areas noted above as may be appropriate under the circumstances.  For purposes of this BAA, Technical Topic Areas (1) and (2) will run concurrently, but research results achieved under each area or subset area are not necessarily co-dependent.  Specifically, Technical Topic Area (1) should achieve its objectives independent of the research conducted under Technical Topic Area (2).  Technical Topic Area (2) research, however, should result in solutions that can be used as a basis to enhance the effort conducted under Technical Topic Area (1).  

SCOPE AND FUNDING:
The government anticipates award of multiple contracts/agreements/other applicable arrangements as defined in the attached Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP).  NOTE: Although this BAA shall remain open for one year from the date of publication in the www.fedbizopps.gov and www.fedgrants.gov the government anticipates that the majority of funding for this program will be committed during the first selections phase.  To be considered for funding during the first selections phase, proposals must be submitted to DARPA no later than 12:00pm local time on 19 December 2003.

PROPOSERS DAY CONFERENCE:

EVALUATION CRITERIA:
Proposers choosing to respond to this BAA will be evaluated against the following five (5) criteria: 1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit, 2) Contribution to DARPA/ATO Mission, 3) Proposer's Capabilities and Related Experience, 4) Approach/Ability to Transition Technology, 5) Cost Realism.  Technical factors (Overall Scientific and Technical Merit and Contribution to DARPA Mission) are considered more important than non-technical factors (Proposer's Capabilities and Related Experience, Approach/Ability to Transition Technology, and Cost Realism).  In accordance with FAR 35.016(e), the primary basis for selecting proposals for award shall be technical, importance to agency programs, and funds availability.  Cost realism and reasonableness shall also be considered to the extent appropriate as described herein.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this BAA.  All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal that shall be considered by DARPA.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of this research for exclusive competition among these entities.

ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE:
Proposers choosing to respond to this BAA must read the associated Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) which provides specific information about this BAA, including instructions on how to respond.

<DESC>CONTRACT INFORMATION: Through this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) is soliciting information and descriptions (white papers) for Climate Change and air quality issues.  The White Papers are to address strategies to improve the energy efficiency of transportation, lower greenhouse gas emissions in the transportation sector, or reduce the impacts of climate change on transportation.  White papers are not to exceed six pages plus a title page and must include the offeror’s contact information: point of contact, telephone number, fax number and email address.  Separate white papers must be submitted for each proposed project and multiple projects cannot be combined into a single white paper.

SPECIAL NOTE:  White papers (first phase proposals) should be submitted on or before November 30, 2003.  The Government expects to complete its review of the white papers and provide feedback to the respondents by January 31, 2004 unless otherwise amended.  Those respondents selected for the second round of proposal development should submit eight (8) copies of each proposal within one month of the date of notification.  

SCOPE:  The transportation sector accounts for about one third of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions and one quarter of U.S. greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.  Climate change and variability associated with these emissions may also impact the Nation’s transportation system.  Much of DOT’s research to deal with climate change is managed through the DOT Center for Climate Change.  Created in 1999, the Center is a partnership of eight DOT operating administrations (Federal Aviation Administration, Federal Highway Administration, Federal Railroad Administration, Federal Transit Administration, Maritime Administration, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and Research and Special Programs Administration and the Bureau of Transportation Statistics) and the Office of the Secretary of Transportation.  Through strategic research, policy analysis, partnerships, and outreach, the Center promotes comprehensive and multimodal approaches to reduce transportation-related greenhouse gases and to mitigate the effects of global climate change on the transportation network.  Additional information regarding DOT’s Center for Climate Change can be found at http://climate.volpe.dot.gov/. 

Objectives

The purposes of this BAA are to:

·promote research on climate change and transportation in the areas described in this notice,

·establish new linkages within the transportation community on climate change issues, and

·foster successful research partnerships.
	
The research will support the U.S. DOT in understanding and addressing transportation-related GHG emissions, examine innovation in the transportation planning and decision-making processes pertinent to climate change matters, and/or improve knowledge of the impacts of climate change on the transportation sector.  The funding is intended to support research or policy evaluation but not technology development, per se.  However, technology development is an important aspect of transportation and climate change and may be a necessary basis for research analysis.  Many policy issues are relevant to multiple modes, and proposals should take this into account.  Partnering with other organizations (including internationally focused or based entities) and cost sharing with the Center are encouraged but not required.

Transportation-Climate Change Research Topic Areas

The DOT Center for Climate Change is interested in funding projects relating to the following three topic areas.  The specific research issues described under each area are examples only.  Other research ideas are encouraged. 

Impact of Climate Variability and Change on Transportation 
This research will examine the potential effects of climate variability and climate change on transportation infrastructure and services and will identify potential adaptation and mitigation strategies for use by transportation decision makers, infrastructure builders and operators, and state and local planners.  

Examples of research issues:
·Conduct of regional climate sensitivity analysis for the transportation sector.

·Synthesis of existing risk assessment data specific to transportation infrastructure and operations.
 
·Identification of data and analysis gaps for future research.

·Assessment of existing transportation planning tools and their ability to appropriately incorporate climate change data.

·Identification of challenges to marine and inland waterway transportation from changes in precipitation patterns or sea level rise.

Increasing Energy Efficiency and Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions
This research will examine opportunities for mitigating the GHG impact of the transportation sector.  Projects may consider the potential for conservation through more efficient transportation practices or through new or emerging technologies, the substitution of non-fossil fuels, or other methods.  Research may pertain to any aspect of reducing the sector’s GHG emissions, from increasing consumer acceptance of new technologies to overcoming challenges in technology deployment.

Examples of research issues:

·Examination of economic, social, and institutional factors in transportation energy consumption.

·Identification of options for improving the freight system’s efficiency.

·Identification of transportation “best practices” that reduce GHG emissions.

·Assessment of potential alternative fuels (including diesel) for light or heavy-duty vehicles and the challenges they pose. 

·Assessment of improving incentives to increase operational efficiency.
  
·Identification of challenges to the introduction of advanced vehicle technologies, such as fuel cells.

Decision making Tools and Their Applications and Modeling
This research will focus on developing and improving analytical tools that could support transportation decision making at all levels of government and in the private sector.  Modeling work may involve fiscal instruments and other market mechanisms, vehicle and fuel characteristics, transportation system design and operation, or other research areas.  Energy models currently in use for decision making, such as the Department of Energy’s National Energy Modeling System (NEMS), represent some important aspects of the transportation sector (e.g. consumer demand and off-highway surface modes); however, they do so at a macro level and operate primarily at the national scale.  Research in this area should provide a better basis for evaluating a broad range of multimodal transportation-related options at different geographic scales.

Examples of research issues:

·Examination of the rate of deployment for alternative fuel infrastructure.

·Development of tools needed to supplement existing tools and processes.

·Improvement of consumer demand reduction and mode selection models to support metropolitan transportation planning. 

·Development of consumer-based models needed to better predict future fleet mixes.

·Modeling of incentive policies to speed the introduction of new, efficient power trains for locomotives, trucks, vessels, or any other vehicles.

·Improvement of availability of GHG emissions data by mode through modeling or other techniques.

·Development of models and methodologies for estimating societal costs and benefits of transportation technologies or policies.


WHITE PAPERS: All products submitted under this program become the property of U.S. DOT and may be disseminated or used for government purposes subsequent to the completion of the work.  The developer of the material also will have continued incidental use of the products for the purpose of additional research or marketing but may not sell or offer the products without prior approval of U.S. DOT.

All products submitted under this program need to meet the U.S. DOT requirements for published and electronic formats, including Section 508 compliance for all web-based products.  Typical formats for electronic deliverables include MS Word, Excel, Access, PowerPoint, Adobe Acrobat PDF and HTML files.  

Proposals should demonstrate professional-level competencies at layout, design, editing and proofreading for both print publication and for posting on an Internet web site.  Prior experience working with Federal Government Printing Office (GPO) standards and Federal Internet web sites will be helpful but is not required.  

The Government will select projects through a two-phase process of proposal submission, review, and acceptance.  In Phase 1, organizations are invited to submit white papers.

<DESC>The Government intends to award an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity Contract with a base period of two years, an option period of three years, and a maximum contract value of $20 million. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for the requirement is 541910 and the size standard is $ 6.0 million. The anticipated release date of the RFP is 11/24/03 with a 30 day response time, and an award date on or before 03/01/04. The requirement is unrestricted; all responsible sources that request the CD-ROM of Materials may submit a proposal, which will be considered. The requirement for The Human Resources Strategic Assessment Program (HRSAP), located at Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC), consists of both Web-based and paper-and-pencil surveys to support the personnel information needs of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness.  The Web-based survey program, known as the Status of Forces Surveys (SOFS), will assess the attitudes and opinions of the entire Department of Defense (DoD) community on a wide range of personnel issues.  There are approximately nine Web-based and two paper-and pencil surveys per year.  There are three SOFS Web surveys of cross-section samples planned per year for each of three different populations—active-duty members, Reserve component members, and DoD civilian employees.  Two paper-and-pencil surveys are planned each year to obtain data on sensitive topics (e.g., sexual harassment) and from populations that have limited Internet access (e.g., spouses of active and Reserve members).  These paper surveys are typically administered with an option to complete the survey on the Web.  Persons sampled for both Web-based and paper-and-pencil surveys are typically contacted multiple times by posta l and e-mail.  A small number of ad hoc surveys can also be expected each year with custom designed samples and methodologies.  Operational support for DMDC surveys involves assembly/distribution activities such as obtaining and assembling DMDC-approved survey materials and distributing them according to a DMDC-approved survey administration plan using Government-supplied sample files and contact instructions.  Survey administration will be by Web-based and paper-and-pencil formats in most cases, but could include other modes.  Operational support also includes receiving survey materials and processing them according to DMDC-approved coding schemes, programs, and weighting plans; preparing datasets in a variety of formats (e.g., column-delimited files, SAS system files, and SPSS system files) with all variable and value labels for the system files; and documenting survey admini stration and datasets with text and codebooks.  Open-ended responses may need to be transcribed by keypunching, recorded as images, and/or coded either from custom-designed coding schemes or from established coding procedures such as those used by the Census Bureau for occupations and ethnic groups.  Rapid response on each Task Order will be essential to avoid delaying survey timelines.  Frequent coordination with DMDC staff shall be required for each Task Order.  Therefore, the ability to send and receive files electronically (e.g., via FTP, the World Wide Web, and e-mail) that are compatible with DMDC capabilities is required.  Web-based authoring tools must be available to DMDC staff to edit the substance and presentation of items and to have the changes posted to a Web-based survey overnight. All potential offerors must be registered in the Central Contract Register (CCR) t o be elgible for award. Information on CCR registration may be obtained by calling 1-888-227-2423 or via the internet at www.ccr.gov. A CD-ROM of materials consisting of: exhibits for submitting cost proposals, report guidelines, content plans for SOFS, questionnaires, and codebooks must be requested by fax or e-mail from the contact listed below. NO PROPOSAL WILL BE CONSIDERED FROM OFFERORS THAT HAVE NOT REQUESTED THE CD-ROM OF MATERIALS. The solicitation will be posted to the NECO web site: http://www.neco.navy.mil. Contractors are responsible for downloading solicitations and monitoring the web site for amendments by selecting Business Opportunities and typing the solicitation number in Search.

<DESC>FSC 1005, NAICS 332994 The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Port Hueneme Division, Louisville Detachment intends to procure an ORDALT to stabilize, add an Electro-Optical Fire Control System (EOFCS), and remote control the MK38 Machine Gun System..  The following are the minimum system requirements for the MK 38 ORDALT:  Mount: Two-axis stabilized, deck mounted, with minimal deck penetration to accommodate connecting power cables and the requisite control/communication cables.  Power: Externally supplied shipboard 60 Hz AC power.  Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) capability for back-up power is highly desirable.  Cannon: Standard Navy 25mm M242, standard Navy Gun Control Unit, and fire 180 rounds per minute.  Ammunition: Gun system shall make use of available; Weapon System Explosive Safety Board (WSESRB) approved ammunition.  Firing Salvo Size: Minimum of Single Shot and Automat ic.  Ammunition Capacity: Minimum 165 ready service rounds utilizing dual feed capability of the M242 cannon.  Ammunition Loading: Loading must be accomplished in a safe and ergonomic manner.  Train/Elevation: Shall have both soft and hard limit stops and meet WSESRB safety standards for safe firing and pointing limits. The mount shall provide maximum depression and elevation angles that are feasible within its design for engagement of surface, subsurface and air threats, in priority order.  The mount shall support a train warning alarm to warn shipboard personnel in vicinity of the mount prior to any initial mount movement during remote operation.  Space and Weight: Ability to be mounted in the current MK38 machine gun footprint and locations while minimizing cost and complexity of any associated SHIPALTs and weight/moment impact to ships.  Operational Availability (Ao):  An A o of 85% is considered a minimum operational standard.  EOFCS: The sensors of the EOFCS will be located on-mount and will be capable of day/night tracking.  The EOFCS will include an eye-safe laser range finder (ELRF), ballistic calculation/correction and optics necessary to detect a High Speed Maneuvering Surface Target (HSMST) to engage at 2000 yards.  The EOFCS should be integrated with an auto-track feature for engaging moving targets.  The ELRF should be capable of operation at a pulse repetition rate sufficient to support effective engagements in the range band of 2000 to 100 yards without overheating or shutting down.  If conditions are such that the ELRF is unable to provide accurate range information, the EOFCS shall support engagement using auto-track azimuth/elevation data with range data entered manually or from an external source.  If conditions are such that the a uto-track feature is ineffective, the EOFCS shall be capable of easily (without taking hands off the controls) switching to an engagement using manual tracking of target azimuth/elevation and target range entered manually or from an external source.  It is desired that the EOFCS accept a manually entered aimpoint offset for warning shot capability.  An interface to enable display of EOFCS video at remote stations within the Ship is desirable.  Control/Tracking: Continuous Day/Night Auto-Track, fully stabilized remote operation, with a degraded local (on mount) back-up capability.  Integrated EOFCS required.   It is desired that the system be able to effectively engage targets using firm target tracks provided by a combat system.  The system shall be capable of being safed from either the local or remote control station.  Both local and remote controls shall have a safety kill s witch.  Shock/Vibration:  Should meet standard shipboard shock, vibration and environmental requirements.  Training:  Must support CD based curriculums at a minimum.  Embedded training scenarios for operator training are highly desirable.  It is desired that embedded trainer be compatible with planned Total Ship Training Architecture as a future spiral development.  Effectiveness: At a minimum, achieve a hit on an HSMST using a three-round burst at a range of 500 yards with a probability of 0.70.  The system should be capable of spiral improvements to allow integration of combined radar/EO/IR sensors already being tested for shipboard application.  The requirement also includes necessary engineering/logistics services to support integration of the ORDALT on U.S. Navy ships.  This acquisition will be conducted using full and open competition under commercial item acquisition pro cedures, Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Part 13 as authorized by the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, Sections 852 and 855.  The intent is to issue a five (5) year firm fixed price Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity type contract for an estimated eighty-three (83) ORDALTs.  The minimum quantity of ORDALTs to be procured is two (2) and the maximum quantity is three hundred and fifty (350).  The following Government Furnished Material (GFM) will be provided for factory acceptance testing purposes only:  M242 Cannon, P/N 6086360 and Navy Gun Control Unit (GCU), P/N 6086003.  It is anticipated that a contract will be awarded by March 3, 2004 with the first order requiring delivery of two (2) ORDALTs by September 2004 and an additional six (6) ORDALTs by December 2005.  Delivery will be required to the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Port Hueneme Division, Louisv ille Detachment, Louisville, Kentucky.

<DESC>The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) in a negotiated procurement for operation, preventative maintenance, and repair services on the building systems, structures and ground structures for the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library/Museum and associated buildings and fixtures at Independence, Missouri. The main building is approximately 46 years old. The systems and support equipment that the Contractor will be responsible for operating and maintaining vary in age, with some items dating to the initial main building construction.  The building is comprised of public space for exhibits and presentation of films and videos; public meeting spaces for programs; offices; research rooms; and areas used to store historical documents, photographs, film, video, historical objects, and works of art.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/notice of intent for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is issued as a Notice of Intent (NOI4011).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-17. The associated North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541380 and the Small Business Size is $6.0M.  The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases intends to procure a sole source service from UT Southwestern, in the collection of Clinical Information and Biological samples from HIV-Infected volunteers. Since the mid 1997 members of the immunology lab for The Vaccine Research Center has been performing experiments with samples from HIV- infected volunteers. Extensive studies have been performed and several manuscripts published based on samples from a specific group HIV- infected Individuals. In order to continue the advances made possible by this research, it is necessary to acquire new samples from these same volunteers.  Many of these volunteers are indigent individuals who receive their medical care at Parkland Hospital at UT Southwestern.  Samples must be taken and prepared at UT Southwestern so that they will be available when needed by the Immunology Lab of the VRC.  Therefore, UT Southwestern would be the only known source for the reagent in the proposed acquisition.  The collection of clinical information and biological samples from HIV-infected volunteers will take place at Parkland Medical Hospital, a part of UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, Texas.  The protocol for this collection must be approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) and the Parkland Hospital and Health Services (PHHS) Research Review committee before being implemented.  Volunteers of long-standing participation will be asked clinical questions by the Research Nurse, often with the aid of a Spanish translator, as many of the volunteers are non-English speaking Individuals.  The Research Nurse will then collect biological samples from these volunteers and deliver these samples to the Research Associate.  The Research Associate will then process and freeze these samples, so that they will be preserved for testing and analysis. The samples will be stored in a -140 degree Celsius freezer until requested by the VRC Immunology lab, where they will be packaged and shipped. The processing of samples will require miscellaneous supplies for the laboratory such as, protective Clothing (gloves, mask, face shield, lab coat), liquid handling devices (tubes, tips, pipettes, conival vials, syringes), and some small equipment (centrifuge, pipetors, pipet-aid).  Along with the clinical information, data gathered while processing the samples will be entered into a database.  This database will exist on a desktop computer with a large enough monitor to adequately view several columns of a spreadsheet, have a Zip drive attached for backing up the database, and a printer attached for hard copy of the data.  Upon completion the VRC will be provided with a collection of biological samples and a database of clinical information for the HIV-infected volunteers. These samples and information will then be used by VRC staff to continue ongoing research into the immunological progression of HIV. Since mid-1997 members of the Immunology Lab of the VRC have been been performing experiments on samples from HIV-infected volunteers taken at Partklawn Hospital through UT Southwestern.  It is necessary to continue acquiring samples from these patients so that on-going research will not be interrupted.

<DESC>Air Force Research Laboratory,  Air Vehicles Directorate, Aeronautical Sciences Division (AFRL/VAA) solicits research proposals for Task 2 of the Active Integrated Inlet-Duct-Engine Demonstration (AIIDED) program.  The AIIDED program seeks to demonstrate the integration of both the inlet aperture and duct closed-loop flow control systems in a very-compact, highly-offset inlet to maximize propulsive efficiency and robustness to flight condition while minimizing reliability pitfalls such as high-cycle fatigue. Recent developments in closed-loop flow control – active flow control integrated with sensors through feedback – demonstrate the performance enhancement potential for aggressive inlet systems. In particular, the Structurally Integrated Compact Inlet Technology (STRICT) program has demonstrated the aerodynamic and structural weight efficiencies to be realized from designing an aircraft inlet system using flow control as an enabling technology. Boundary layer flow control may further aid in the integration of the forebody and inlet by providing a “virtual” boundary layer diverter, allowing the aerostructural design of inlet aperture de-emphasize flow quality requirements in favor of other geometric and/or weight constraints. Desired characteristics of the integrated configuration are: an advanced, conformal inlet aperture with integrated forebody; duct-diffuser length to diameter ratio (L/D) objective of 2.0, with a threshold L/D of 2.5; compatibility with current low-observable design philosophies and requirements, including 100% line of sight blockage to the engine face at all viewing angles; designed using advanced probabilistic hammershock load methodologies; manufactured using advanced production methodologies; a robust closed-loop flow control system integrated into the inlet aperture, duct and/or diffuser; an advanced turbine engine; configuration applicable to future UAVs such as UCAV and Sensorcraft. The demonstrations should show that this integration has positive or no degrading effect on installed propulsive efficiency and reliability when compared to less aggressive inlets designed to current engineering standards (e.g., F-35 / JSF). Analysis and tests include, at a minimum: integrated closed-loop flow control system demonstrations, including dynamic control; integrated forebody-inlet aero-control demonstration showing system robustness; installed aeropropulsion performance demonstration; structural integrity and producibility of integrated, flight-ready hardware. Additional testing required to bring the Technology Readiness Level of the integrated actively-controlled inlet to a level 6 should be accomplished.  Demonstration of integration details including actuator and sensor structural integration, power requirements, control system architecture and integration, structural failure criteria, dynamic distortion prediction methodologies, and inlet/engine interface requirements is important to reduce risk for future programs that will utilize this technology. This design should present net weight and installed performance benefits and minimal additional power and other interface requirements over the current state of the art. The Versatile Affordable Integrated Inlet-Fan for Performance and Reliability (VAIIPR),  Task 1 of the AIIDED program, will demonstrate the integrated performance of a flow-control-enabled duct flow path with an advanced fan. Importantly, this demonstration will quantify the benefit inlet flow control will have on the high-cycle fatigue characteristics of highly-loaded fan stages. .

<DESC>POC Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009, email: ekunene@tda.gov.  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT THE CONTRACTS OFFICE.  PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE:  Assistant General Manager, Beijing Drainage Group Co., Ltd., No.4 Longtanhubei, Chongwen District, Beijing, CHINA 100061, Phone: 86-10-6719-2838, Fax: 86-10-6714-7709.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to conduct a feasibility study to develop a sludge management plan to use or dispose of the considerable volume of wastewater treatment plant sludge that is generated in wastewater treatment plants throughout Beijing.  

During the past 20 years, China has experienced rapid economic growth and industrialization.  At the same time, China’s urban population has increased from 190 million in 1980 to almost 400 million in 1998.  While rapid industrialization has improved the standard of living for most Chinese citizens, environmental degradation and a lack of primary infrastructure services threaten human health, water and air quality, as well as the prospects for continued economic growth.  

Due to recent environmental advances in China, and Beijing in particular, considerable volumes of sludge are being generated as a by-product of the wastewater treatment process.  As the amount of wastewater treatment increases, so does the amount of sludge to be disposed of.  Treatment and disposal of sludge are complex matters with a number of concerns to take under consideration.  Currently, many sludge disposal facilities in China are not operating satisfactorily.  Often, untreated sludge is simply disposed of at landfill sites, resulting in environmental degradation.    The study will review and address the different sludge disposal methods, sewage treatment processes currently in use or proposed, and how modifications to those processes will affect the amount and quality of sludge being produced.  This plan should incorporate advanced foreign technology and wastewater treatment management practices appropriate for sludge treatment and minimization.  The plan will be based on four facilities:

·	Gaobeidian Wastewater Treatment Works;
·	Xiaohongmen Wastewater Treatment Works;
·	Dongbu  (Louzizhuang) Sludge Digestion Plant; and
·	Panggezhuang Sludge Treatment Works.

The two wastewater treatment plants will receive the sewage generated by the Olympic Village.  The Grantee plans to transport the dewatered sludge from these two plants to the Louzizhuang Sludge Digester Plant.  The quality of the treatment will directly affect the environment of the Olympic Village and it is critical to identify the best method to treat the wastewater and sludge.  
 
The Feasibility Study Terms of Reference (TOR) are as follows:

Task 1: Review available sludge management technologies
Task 2: Characterize sludge generation
Task 3: Develop schemes for sludge processing, transportation and disposal
Task 4: Evaluate schemes and develop preliminary implementation
Task 5: Conduct study tour in the United States
Task 6: Conduct preliminary environmental assessment
Task 7: Develop project implementation plan and financing strategy
Task 8: Preparation of Final Report

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $350,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the TOR, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English and Chinese directly to the Grantee by 4:00 P.M., December 19, 2003 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

This acquisition will be a 100% Small Business Set-Aside; the NAICS code is 325211, and the size standard is 750.  The Government intends to award a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract for the design, development and delivery of Chemical/Biological (CB)liners first articles to be used with the latest Air Force Medium Shelter system (MSS) currently in inventory. This project will be called the “Large Capacity Shelter CB Liner (LCS CB Liner).”  It will be a 5-layer Saranex laminate CB liner, that will be used in conjunction with other CB components in inventory to provide a collective protection (CP) system that is needed in bare base, medical, and special operations deployments worldwide. A prototype “non-CB” liner made of lightweight polyester was developed and installed into a MSS. This anticipated award will require the contractor to develop first article, conduct first article tests according to government specifications, and deliver successful first article, test data, Level III Drawings and performance specification.  Based upon the availability of funds, the government will compete production of the LCS CB liner at a later date.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR Telemetry Tracking Antenna.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to answer the following questions: 1.  What is the maximum height that can be tolerated on top of the van?  We are trying to keep the entire installation profile low as possible.  We are trying not to interfere with other antennas and they are trying not interfere with us. 2.  What is the frequency range desired?  1650 - 2300 MHz?  1435 -2300 MHz?  1435 - 2300 MHz 3.  At 1650 MHz, and because an autotrack feed at this frequency is physically large (causes aperture blockage), we have calculated that we will need a reflector that is over 30" in diameter.	Is this acceptable Size will be one of the factors in our decision.      4.  Does the user desire a 3-axis system to handle overhead tracking, or will a 2-axis system suffice given that the beamwidth is so large?  We do need overhead tracking. 5.  Please describe the environmental conditions that this system will operate in (temp, wind, humidity etc)	We will operate in rain.  Expect temperatures -10 C to +50 C. 6.  What is the required velocity and acceleration of this system to accomplish the mission? Velocity 100 deg/sec Acceleration 100 deg/sec2 7.  What is the pointing/tracking accuracy requirement? +/- 10 degress The due date for receipt of offers IS extended to COB, Monday, November 10, 2003.

Question 1: I believe the RFP is look[ing] for [a] National faith-based organization and/or a partner with a n[a]tional faith-based organization.

Can you please clarify "National?"  Answer 3: [A national faith-based organization] is the national organizing, representational,  policy making or leadership entity for several faith based member units, such as churches, temples, mosques, etc that are located in multiple states across the United States.  It is usually a non-profit organization that has a network of contributing members. Question 4: Is it possible to send me a copy of a successful project from a previous solicitation to review? Answer 4: Proposals received by the Government in response to solicitations contain proprietary information and data and therefore cannot be given out as samples.

<DESC>The previous notice is revised to read as follows: The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) No. 617-04-001 to implement follow-on 44-month Strengthening Decentralization in Uganda II (SDU II) activity. Local governments in Uganda, though in place and functioning, cannot fully perform all the responsibilities and duties devolved to them.  This situation is further complicated by disconnects between the various planning and budgeting processes, as well as the lack of a strong interface between local governments and various elements of the community. Local governments lack capacity to forge sectoral commitments for economic growth and social services, to respond to new allocation formulas under the Fiscal Decentralization System for resource flows to the districts, and to join stakeholders to a political process for effective planning and budgeting. Increasing local revenue generation to meet rising local government staff and services needs involves a parallel challenge to Local governments to engage communities and key tax and fee payers. And, with rising opportunity for corruption in their ranks, local government must adapt to a new set of harmonized regulations for local procurement and to organize the work of Local Tender Boards so as to assure public transparency. Success in addressing these problems will make local governments trusted agents in the redistribution of Central Government transfers, as well as locally generated revenue. USAID has already invested greatly in establishing a strategic framework and creating the enabling processes to support decentralization.  We now move into a critical period in which lessons learned must be applied to the broad base of local government across the country. USAID has identified a select set of critical areas for active engagement which include: planning and budgeting for fiscal decentralization, local procurement processes (including anti corruption), local revenue generation and  support of key USAID sectoral priorities at the local level, specifically HIV/AIDS, Health and Education,  and 2. enabling activities that strengthen community and Community Based  Organization (CBO) linkages with local government, provide effective tools for management, capacity building and service delivery and ultimately contribute to expansion of  the democratic base of local governance. Funds are not presently available for this contract. The Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon availability of appropriated FY2004 funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. The anticipated date for issuance of the RFP is November 10, 2003.

Performance will be at the Washington, DC and Fort Worth, TX facilities, and BEP supplier plants.  Do not contact BEP's suppliers at this time; you will not need to do so in order to respond to this RFQ because the Government has defined a level of effort under the SOW.

BACKGROUND: The life Connections Program provides inmates with intensive opportunities for spiritual growth and deepening their religious roots by sharing common space and programs for the purpose of personal transformation and reducing recidivism.  Inmates will participate in religion specific and inter-faith program components designed to bring restoration with God, family, community, and self.  The program’s design will  increase religious tolerance and respect among inmates of various faiths; will connect each inmate with a spiritual mentor; and will link participants with a faith community at their release destination in order to enhance community reintegration.   Another component of the program will initiate specific Victim Impact programs to assist inmates in claiming responsibility for their actions and making amends with victims, family, and community.  The program will enlist  partnerships with individuals and organizations in its efforts to lower recidivism and facilitate spiritual growth and personal change.  Volunteers, contractors, mentors, sponsoring religious congregations and organizations are all essential partners in the program.  The goal of the Bureau of Prisons Residential Faith-based Program is to provide inmates living in a shared living space with intensive opportunities for holistic life restoration for the purpose of reducing recidivism and enhancing prison management.

Prospective contractors should be able to adequately support services that will range from a minimum of $10,000.00 to a maximum potential of $100 million annually.

The Transportable Collective Protection System_s (TCPS) Kitting Program IPT at 311th Human Systems Program Office, Brooks AFB, TX is in the process of seeking information from industry regarding an effort for this program.  This announcement is not a formal solicitation and is not a request for proposal.  Any formal solicitation will be announced separately.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. 

BACKGROUND/REQUIREMENT

The contractor is provided the following information: (1) TCPS equipment lists NSNs, nomenclature and quantity required (by fiscal year); (2) pack/kit listing that indicates item quantities per kit, weight/cube data, and kit destination.  The square footage requirement is estimated for 20,000 sq.ft. inside warehouse space and 10,000 sq. ft. adjacent, outside, fenced storage.

Require warehouse space (both inside and outside storage) with a small office area to provide the appropriate work area to house assets, prepare / assemble kits, and shipment preparation activities for three programs: Transportable Collective Protection System (TCPS), Chemically / biologically Hardened Air Transportable Hospital (CHATH), and the Collectively Protected Expeditionary Medical Support (CP EMEDS). All three provide protection to our warfighters in a CB contaminated environment. Because these systems are costly and serve to provide life saving capability for our troops, we require a level of security such as a fenced, limited access facility.

Performance Goals for Task 1 are: (1) Receipt/issue data verified for accuracy, (2) Material stowed in assigned location, (3) Kit assembled per schedule, (4) Kits packed IAW storage plan, (5) Process an average of 2 items per hour.

Task 2: Deliver Material:  The contractor shall deliver material to Shipping or Air Terminal and pick up material for return to the warehouse. It is expected that 80 deliveries will be required.   A Performance Goal for Task 2 is Material load in a manner to prevent damage.

Task 3:  Research/Requisition/Expedite Material:  The contractor shall research source availability for items indicated on the TCP equipment list, requisition material from Federal Supply System or Open Purchase.  The expected delivery date status of material shall be monitored, and expediting actions taken for those items that indicate unsatisfactory status.  Expediting includes communication with Inventory Control Points (ICP) and manufacturers.  Performance Goals for Task 3 are:  (1) Research documented, and source of material accurately identified and (2) Audit trail of expediting actions documented.

Task 4:  Overtime Requirements:  The contractor shall provide after hours support for late breaking requirements.  Based on past history, the contractor should anticipate that 1% of total effort will be accomplished outside of normal working hours.  Prior authorization for overtime would be required.  Performance Goal for Task 4 is to meet performance goals established for task requiring the overtime.

CONTRACTOR FURNISHED EQUIPMENT:  Estimated requirements include (1) 6K Forklift, (2) 5K Truck, (3) Fuel, and (4) Three workstations with PC and appropriate software.

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  Either 1 April 2001 through 31December 2001 OR 13 Jul 01 through 31 December 2001

<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is seeking potential sources for services in support of the Directorate for Security and Program Protection in policy-making, oversight, and in some cases, the implementation of the full range of protection services required to support technology development and weapons system acquisition programs.  Support would also be provided for The Counterintelligence Directorate, which is tasked with oversight of programs to gather information on foreign intelligence efforts directed at MDA and the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS), with making that information available to members of MDA and its subordinate offices, and with assisting in planning efforts to protect against asymmetrical attacks on BMDS elements or to prevent loss of MDA information to adversaries.  MDA intends to utilize GSA ordering procedures to acquire the services described in this notice.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541690 Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services, with a size standard of $6,000,000.00.  This requirement is unrestricted; however, MDA may limit the sources solicited to only small businesses if a sufficient number of qualified small business sources respond.  All small business respondents shall confirm that their size status is small on both their applicable GSA FSS contract and under the NAICS code size standard.  Interested GSA schedule holders judged best qualified to compete for the work will be sent a Request for Quotations package within the next three (3) weeks with offers due two (2) weeks later.  This procurement is for professional services of approximately 50 personnel to provide expert, specialized support to a very dynamic organization charged with addressing complex threat-based challenges.  There are six principal areas of endeavor:  Organizational Security, Program Protection, International Security, Information Safeguards, Special (SCI) Security, and Counterintelligence.  Organizational Security covers the security disciplines for protection of MDA facilities, personnel, and resources.  This includes Physical Security, Industrial Security, Personnel Security and Security Education and Awareness.  Program Protection focuses on development of protection plans and methods to support security risk mitigation of weapon system and technology acquisition and development programs in theater and national missile defenses.  Formal identification and validation of Critical Program Information (CPI) serves as the centerpiece in the development of acquisition Program Protection Plans.  Program Protection is also responsible for the MDA Operations Security (OPSEC) program.  International Security focuses on protection of U.S. classified and sensitive unclassified information being considered for release to foreign governments.  All standards relating to foreign disclosure, technology transfer, international security policy, and classification management must be applied.  The International Traffic in Arms Regulations and other export licensing standards must also be applied.  Information Safeguards focuses on classification management and declassification of MDA and BMDS technical information, as well as security review of proposals for public release of information and requests for information under the Freedom of Information Act.  Special Security focuses on protection of Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI).  Counterintelligence focuses on application of intelligence community-developed foreign intelligence or terrorist threat data and information; development of counterintelligence training materials; and application of this information to mitigate risks to MDA’s development and acquisition of missile defense systems.  Conduct of recurring open-literature searches is important in order to assess the extent of unauthorized or sensitive information in the public domain which could aggravate protection concerns.  Support personnel will work within the spaces of MDA’s Security and Program Protection Directorate and Counterintelligence Directorate in MDA’s offices in the National Capital Region, but may be required periodically to perform duties at locations other than MDA and the immediate Washington DC area.  The term of the order including options is anticipated to be at least five (5) years.  All positions will be on site at the following MDA locations: MDA Headquarters at the Federal Office Building 2 (FOB2) in Arlington, VA,  and Suffolk Bldg on Arlington Blvd. In Fairfax County.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION:  The Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Coast Guard, Maintenance and Logistics Command Atlantic, Norfolk, VA and the United States Coast Guard Academy, Leadership Development Center (LDC), in New London, Connecticut are seeking interested sources to provide all labor, supervision, transportation, training aids and training materials, except for materials and facilities furnished by the government, for (1) an innovative Instructor Qualification Course (IQC) in leadership and (2) leadership course training materials for IQC-trained instructors to use in subsequent LDC courses.  During the first year of this contract, the course will be taught at the Leadership Development Center (LDC).  In subsequent years, additional locations may be utilized.  The audience for the IQC will be Coast Guard officers, enlisted, Auxiliary, and civilian personnel currently assigned to the LDC, New London CT.  Instructors certified through attendance at the IQC will subsequently teach LDC leadership courses and use the training materials purchased under the resultant contract.  The contracted instructors should have as a minimum, an earned master’s degree, however, an earned doctorate is preferred, and a minimum of three years experience in a leadership position.

BACKGROUND:  The LDC is located at the Coast Guard Academy in New London, CT, with satellite locations at Petaluma, CA and Yorktown, VA.  The LDC’s Leadership and Quality Institute (LQI) is responsible for teaching and facilitating courses equivalent to civilian adult continuing professional education.  Over 2000 students are taught each year in the LQI’s Leadership and Management School; one of six major schools within the LDC.  Many of the officer, enlisted, civilian, and Auxiliary members of the Coast Guard, will attend training provided by the LDC’s LQI.

Omnipresent issues related to national security require that the Coast Guard’s leadership training be at the highest possible level appropriate to student experience and responsibilities.  It is necessary to approach Coast Guard leadership training in the same way that civilian corporations advance their employees’ leadership skills.  Rarely do successful civilian corporations have the manpower or materials to identify, design, and deliver their own state-of-the-art leadership curricula.  Civilian corporations contract out for sophisticated leadership training.  The Coast Guard cannot afford to purchase leadership training for all its personnel.  The next best option is to obtain a commercially prepared IQC to meet both the instructor-training requirement and the urgent need for quality in leadership training. 

The Coast Guard is currently in the process of developing specific requirements for this course.  As of yet the type of contract has not been decided although it is anticipated that the majority of the requirement may be fixed price and other services may be performed on a time and material or cost reimbursement basis.  The Coast Guard envisions the future contractor having an intricate network of resources to provide all aspects of the leadership-training course and materials as described.

<DESC>NA The US Armys Aviation and Missile Research Development and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) anticipates a requirement for the acquisition of Difficult to Obtain aviation, missile, and ground support equipment spare parts.  The needed parts could be on any aviat ion or missile system (i.e. PATRIOT, AH-64 Apache, Multiple Launch Rocket System, etc.) but are more likely to be for legacy systems (i.e. Avenger, Kiowa, CH-47 Chinook, etc.).  This requires the development of qualified fabrication sources for each part. Parts that are difficult for the government to obtain could be due to (but not limited to) no Technical Data Package (TDP), inadequate TDP, proprietary data in TDP, obsolescence, infrequent procurements, low quantities, logistics costs, foreign dependency,  diminishing manufacturing sources, late or non delivery of contracted sources, and/or no bids.   The AMRDEC is soliciting organizations that would be interested in providing products and/or services for: 1.	Reverse Engineering / Build-To-Sample Documentation 	From a single or small sample of parts, develop and deliver technical information to the government to be used to manufacture a mirror-image part.  This data would include but is not limited to dimensions, material specifications, reasonable tolerances, o ne or more manufacturing methods, and process controls. 2.	Level III Technical Data Package (TDP) per MIL STD-100 Drawing Standard, or associated ANSI Y-14.1 through ANSI Y-14.32 GDT Specifications         a.  Update/Revise inadequate or partial TDPs to a full Level III Configuration         b.  Digital 3-Dimensional Model using an industry-standard File Format such as IGES, STEP, or PARASOLIDS         c.  Digital TDP using an industry standard file format such as DFX, PDF, DWG, or IGES         d.  Paper Copy of Level III TDP         e.  VHDL or other Software Models for Electronic TDPs, including all source code and compiled configuration model data. 3.	Redesign and Rapid Prototyping of existing designs to newer-technology of smaller scale circuitry 4.	ISO 9000 Certified Quality Management System for Manufacturing/Repair Process prove out 5.	First Article Testing per MIL STD 810 	Capability to Provide Temperature, Shock, Thermal Shock, Vibration, Altitude, Rapid Pressure, Loads, Acoustic, EMIC, Salt Spray, Humidity, and Fungus Environmental Testing 6.	Cost-Effectively provide Limited Production quantities Additional:   Contractor is to provide justifiable projections as to compliance with any Government provided reliability requirements. Contractor is to assure compliance with 18 month start-to-finish timetable requirement. Contractor is to assure compliance with Buy-American Act. Responders should note that this RFI may result in multiple statements-of-work, solicitations and awards. If the US government pursues this initiative by subsequently contracting with one or more contractors, it may provide as little as one part as GFE for the Reverse Engineering effort.  The government may or may not provide some technical data.  The US gover nment will not provide any data considered proprietary to any organization. Interested contractors will need to provide an indication of interest in either some or all of the areas identified above.  On the areas of interest, a full description of capabilities and limitations is requested as well as company history in the same or similar efforts, particularly for military customers (i.e. Parts Manufacturing, Development of TDPs, Rapid Acquisition for Manufactured Parts, Reverse Engineering, Modernization Through Spares, Continuous Technology Refreshment, etc.).  This information ma y be provided in any format the responder chooses. Categorization may be helpful (i.e. interested in all six areas to include subparts, or interested in all six areas but only for engine parts, or interested in all six areas but only for electronic parts or interested only in production when level III TDP is provided, or intere sted only in the formulation of the TDPs, or interested only in aviation parts, or interested in Avenger system, etc.)  On electronic deliveries, please specify software and/or medium(s) capabilities / file formats to be used (i.e. Pro E, Auto CAD, etc.).  Please indicate areas in which you are not interested.  Any area that a responder is silent on will be considered as non-interest in that area.  Please indicate current or past experience you have had with the government on the same or similar work. Interested firms must respond in writing to the identified point of contact by 12 December 2003.  Please indicate your business status (Large, small, small disadvantage, woman owned, domestic, foreign owned, etc.). A set of Sample Piece Parts and/or a partial TDP may be provided to interested Firms.

<CONTACT>Courtney Jones, 503-808-4630
<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Portland District, proposes to contract for Video Inspection Services at Fern Ridge Dam.  This synopsis is intended to result in a Firm Fixed Price Contract sole source to Vista Engineering Technologies, L.L.C. The  estimated award date of this contract is November 2003.  To be eligible for award a firm must be registered with the Department of DefenseÃ¢Â€Â™s (DoD) Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.  Register at the CCR Internet site at  www.ccr.gov.  Fern Ridge Dam is located on the Long Tom River in the Willamette Basin. The dam has a mile long longitudinal main drain that collects seepage through the dam, and 11 lateral drains discharging the seepage at the toe of the dam.  The main drain runs the le ngth of the dam, offset 50 ft downstream of the dam centerline, and is 20 to 25 ft below grade. The main drain is an 8-in.-diameter, 14-gauge corrugated metal pipe with bituminous coating. The pipe is surrounded by filter gravel. The pipe joints are 7-in.- wide half-circle bands riveted to abutting sections. The bottom 120-degree portion of the main drain is perforated with 3/8 in. holes on 1-Ã‚Â½ in. centers. The perforations only occur in the valleys of the corrugations.  A depression was observed on the d ownstream face of the embankment in July 2002, approximately above the main drain location.  Two additional depressions were also observed above the main drain location in February 2003. In addition, there are no access points to the main drain line other than from the existing lateral drain lines.  Due to the proximity of the depressions to the location of the main drain line, it is critical that the condition of the main drain be determined.  Equipment capable of video inspecting the mile long main drain was not been developed until this year.  The Contractor shall video inspect the full length of the 5,736 ft of main drainpipe. The Contractor shall select the appropriate equipment and method for the video inspection.  However, if a blockage / obstruction is encountered that cannot be removed without risk to the ContractorÃ¢Â€Â™s equipment or to the integrity of the embankment, the Contractor shall suspend the inspection and notify the Government point of contact immediately.  The Contractor shall be compen sated for configuration of video inspection equipment for project, mobilization, demobilization, and actual duration of equipment rental and labor time for inspection.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Portland, Oregon intends to award this contract under the sole source provisions of FAR 6.302-1.  Firms that recognize and can furnish the required services are encouraged to identify themselves to USACE for consideration in future solicitations. North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541990, size standard is $6,000,000.00.  Request  for verbal presentation of qualifications will not be permitted.  This is not a request for proposal.  Solicitation packages are not provided.  Point of Contact is George Williams, Contract Specialist, (503) 808-4615.

<SUBJECT>52--PORTABLE COORDINATE MEASURING MACHINE
<DESC>Description: This publication serves as a notice of intent to procure on sole source basis, with Axila, Inc. for a Portable Coordinate Measuring Machine.  The authority is only one responsible source, 10 U.S. C.2304© (1). This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/GSFC intends to purchase the Axila 2000 Series Portable Coordinate Measuring Machine from Axila, Inc.	The item to be purchased is a standard item in the company catalog and meets NASA requirements.	The Axila product offers significant features not found in other systems -- most notably, the test volume for the selected system is significantly larger than the volume of the next nearest competitor system.  Other significant features include the ability to store the measuring arm outside of the experiment volume when the arm is not in use, and the portable nature of the system. These product features are required to fully support NASA's requirements.  The system will need to interface with other test bed components and elements. The software output of the system is in a form that can easily be transferred to the mechanical design software, allowing the development of "as-Built" design drawings to be created.   Purchase of this system from another vendor would necessitate an extensive design evaluation process as well as a fabrication effort. Such an effort is would be expensive, and introduces both schedule delays and technical complexity that is unacceptable based on programmatic need. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact no later than 4:30 p.m. local time on 11/17/2003. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. An Ombudsman has been Appointed. See NASA Specific Note "B".
