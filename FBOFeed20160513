Respondents shall specify status as a large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a) concern, women-owned small business, economically disadvantaged women-owned small business, HUBZone small business, veteran-owned small business, or service-disabled veteran-owned small business. This synopsis does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB) or a Request for Proposals (RFP), nor does it restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach. The government will not reimburse any costs associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice.

20.  Mandatory Language:
In accordance with FAR 5.207(c) (16) (i), all responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  
It is anticipated that this requirement is competitive.  Non-approved sources wishing to submit a bid may do so; however; only qualified sources will be considered for award.  Government First Articles may be required from newly approved sources.  
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.  
This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS. Request for written quotation will be issued.  Only written or faxed request received directly from the requestors are acceptable. The anticipated award date will be 60 days after the issuance of this notice. 21.  Questions concerning this synopsis or subsequent solicitation can be directed to PCO Jeffrey Wyatt at (405) 582-       5644  or Jeffrey.Wyatt@us.af.mil .

In accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(B), the Space and Missile Systems Center's Space Superiority Systems Directorate (SMC/SY) intends to award a sole source Firm-Fixed-Priced (FFP)/Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee contract for sustainment support of the Logistics Information Operations Network System (LIONS) to TASC (formerly known as The Analytic Sciences Corporation), an Engility Company (hereafter referred to as TASC), 35 New England Business Center Drive, Ste 200, Andover, MA 01810-1438. The Government anticipates the period of performance for this contract will be five (5) and a half years; consisting of a base year, four (4) one-year option periods, and one 6-month option period, from approximately July 2016 - January 2022.</p>
<p>This contract will provide sustainment services for the LIONS, which is currently provided under contract #FA8819-11-C-0002, by TASC.

You can also find the DD2345 at <a href="http://www.dlis.dla.mil/JCP/forms/DD2345Form.pdf">http://www.dlis.dla.mil/JCP/forms/DD2345Form.pdf</a><br />&lt;http://www.dlis.dla.mil/JCP/forms/DD2345Form.pdf&gt;- .&nbsp; Fill out the DD2345 form and submit a hard copy of the original form, together with all required documentation, to the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS), U.S./Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP), at the address listed on&nbsp;the form.&nbsp;JCP will return an approved and signed certified form, which will include your certification and expiration date within five days of receipt.&nbsp;Please note that delays may be incurred if forms and/or required documentation are incomplete or incorrect.&nbsp;Additionally, it can take up to 24 hours for the JCP information to reach all systems.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once you receive the approved DD2345 form from JCP and have verified your status on the JCP website, http://www.logisticsinformationservice.dla.mil/jcp/search.aspx, enter the FBO system and click on the secure document link.&nbsp; The FBO system will require you to enter your MPIN.</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp; The MPIN number is a mandatory data element created by the CCR registrant and must have nine characters: at least one letter (upper or lower case) and one number. No spaces or special characters are permitted. It allows access to related acquisition systems (i.e. ORCA and PPIRS). It also serves as a validation to access sensitive but unclassified documents associated with a notice posted to FBO.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following verification of the MPIN in FBO, vendors will submit a request for explicit access to the secure documents through the FBO system by clicking on the secure document line, then clicking the "Request Explicit Access" button.&nbsp; Once vendors request explicit access, the FBO system will send notification to the DLA Energy personnel assigned to the procurement, who will approve the request in the system.&nbsp;Vendors will receive an email once the access request has been approved by DLA Energy.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the MPIN has been verified in the FBO system, and explicit access has been granted, vendors will be able to enter the system and view the secure documents.</p>

During the course of on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposals are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>

<DESC>INTRODUCTION
<p>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) SYNOPSIS TO AWARD A PURCHASE ORDER WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION.</p>
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Becton, Dickinson and Company, 1 Becton Dr, Franklin Lakes, NJ 07417, to procure a variety of reagents that are required by the Hematology Branch for the phenotyping of patient cell samples.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>Dr. Young's research is focused on bone marrow failure-human diseases that result in a failure to produce blood cells, i.e. aplastic anemia. His comprehensive bedside-to-bench approach begins with enrolling hundreds of patients per year in the largest bone marrow failure clinic in the world. His laboratory uses a variety of approaches to analyze these patient samples for clues to disease etiology, which then inform work in animal models. One technique often utilized is flow cytometry.</p>
<p>Flow cytometry is a laser-based, biophysical technology employed in cell counting, cell sorting, biomarker detection and protein engineering, performed by suspending cells in a stream of fluid and passing them through an electronic detection apparatus. This technique allows simultaneous multiparametric analysis of the physical and chemical characteristics of up to thousands of particles per second. Flow cytometry is routinely used in the diagnosis of health disorders, especially blood cancers, but has many other applications in basic research, clinical practice and clinical trials. A common variation is to physically sort particles based on their properties, so as to purify populations of interest. This process relies on using reagents that are consistent with previously utilized reagents, as any changes to the protocol (including reagents, instruments, testing conditions, etc.) would invalidate study data.</p>
<p>PURPOSE</p>
<p>The purpose of this acquisition is to procure a variety of reagents that are required by the lab for the phenotyping of patient cell samples. It is imperative that these reagents are consistent with previously utilized reagents.</p>
<p>PROCUREMENT</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide the following:</p>
<p>&bull;	Anti-Kappa FITC TB28-2 ASR - Quantity 15ea<br />&bull;	Anti-Lambda PE 1-55-2 ASR - Quantity 3ea<br />&bull;	CD10 APC HI10a ASR - Quantity 4ea<br />&bull;	CD117 APC 104D2 ASR - Quantity 3eac<br />&bull;	CD117 PerCP-Cy5.5 104D2 50 Tests RUO/GMP - Quantity 15ea<br />&bull;	CD11b APC D12 100 Tests RUO/GMP - Quantity 2ea<br />&bull;	CD13 PE L138 ASR - Quantity 2ea<br />&bull;	CD14 APC-H7 MphiP9 100 Tests RUO/GMP - Quantity 3ea<br />&bull;	CD19 PE SJ25C1 50 Tests RUO/GMP - Quantity 4ea<br />&bull;	CD19 PE-Cy7 SJ25C1 ASR - Quantity 3ea<br />&bull;	CD3 PerCP-Cy5.5 SK7 ASR - Quantity 8ea<br />&bull;	CD33 PerCP-Cy5.5 P67.6 50 Tests RUO/GMP - Quantity 15ea<br />&bull;	CD34 PE-Cy7 8G12 ASR - Quantity 4ea<br />&bull;	CD5 PE L17F12 100 Tests RUO/GMP - Quantity 3ea<br />&bull;	CD5 PerCP-Cy5.5 L17F12 50 Tests RUO/GMP - Quantity 4ea<br />&bull;	CD57 FITC - Quantity 3ea<br />&bull;	CD8 APC-H7 SK1 ASR - Quantity 3ea<br />&bull;	CD34 PerCP-Cy5.5 8G12 ASR - Quantity 8ea<br />&bull;	CD27 APC L128 100 Tests RUO/GMP - Quantity 1ea<br />&bull;	CD61 FITC RUU-PL7F12 100 Tests RUO/GMP - Quantity 4ea<br />&bull;	BD FACS Lysing Solution 10X 100ML IVD - Quantity 6ea<br />&bull;	BD Stabilizing Fixative 3X Conc 90mL - Quantity 6ea<br />&bull;	Hu CD14 Pacific Blue M5E2 100ug - Quantity 2ea<br />&bull;	Hu CD16 FITC 3G8 100Tst - Quantity 4ea<br />&bull;	Hu CD42b FITC HIP1 100Tst - Quantity 4ea<br />&bull;	Hu CD45 Horizon V500 HI30 100Tst - Quantity 15ea</p>
<p>JUSTIFICATION</p>
<p>The research performed at the Hematology Branch (HB) relies on the characterization of cell types by flow cytometry. The laboratory tested many manufacturers' products when the protocol began and has established that for their needs, BD Biosciences products are the reagents that best maintain consistency and quality in the research. Experimental conditions require that the specific clones of antibodies sold by Becton Dickinson continue to be used, as we need to have consistency throughout this protocol. Consistency is critical to data validity, and we must ensure that experimental protocols are maintained and unchanged for all studies performed.</p>
<p>REGULATORY AUTHORITY</p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 13.106-1(b) Soliciting from a single source (for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold) and only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 339113, Surgical Appliance and Supplies Manufacturing, and the Small Business Size Standard is 750 employees. The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competitive Requirements, are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001). The resultant award will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-87 (April 6, 2016).</p>
<p>This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this notice.  Responses to this notice shall contain sufficient information to establish the interested parties' bona-fide capabilities for fulfilling the requirement and include: unit price, list price, shipping and handling costs, the delivery period after contract award, the prompt payment discount terms, the F.O.B. Point (Destination or Origin), the Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number (DUNS), the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), and the certification of business size.

<SUBJECT>Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) Services for the J.W. Peck Tenant Backfill Project in Cincinnati, Ohio
<SOLNBR>GS-05-P-16-GB-C-7005
<ARCHDATE>12302016
<CONTACT>William M. Chapman, Contracting Officer, Phone (312)880-9472, Email william.chapman@gsa.gov
<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA), Great Lakes Region 5, announces an opportunity to provide Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) services for the J.W. Peck Tenant Backfill Project in Cincinnati, Ohio. The scope of CMc services under this proposed contract includes Design Phase Services and an option for Construction Phase Services.<br />
<p><br />The CMc will be competitively chosen using source selection (FAR 15) procedures. The objective of the source selection process is to select a proposal that represents the best value to the Government. The award will be made to the responsible Offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and offers the best value to the Government, considering the technical factors and the total evaluated price. For this procurement, the technical factors with be significantly more important than price (FAR 15.101-1, Trade Offs). The technical factors will include Experience in providing Design Phase Services and Construction Phase Services on similar projects; Project Management Plan/Approach; Qualifications and Experience of Key Personnel; Past Performance in providing Design Phase Services and Construction Phase Services on similar projects, and Project Labor Agreement. Additionally, Cost Accounting Standard (CAS) compliance shall represent a go/no-go factor. The Contractor must demonstrate their compliance with CAS through the submittal of all disclosures in accordance with FAR 52.230-1, Cost Accounting Standards Notice and Certifications and FAR 52.230-7, Proposal Disclosure - Cost Accounting Practice Changes.</p>
<p><br />The Government reserves the right to make award on initial offers, but discussions may be held if appropriate. The estimated total construction cost for the project falls within the range of $25,000,000 to $35,000,000. The Design Phase Services are anticipated to commence upon award of the contract on or about October 30, 2016. The optional Construction Phase Work is anticipated to be awarded in or around March 2017, with a performance period of approximately 496 days.</p>
<p><br />The requirement for this opportunity includes restacking the IRS within the building and renovating their current space, as well as renovating building vacant space for incoming tenants. IRS currently occupies 165,000 USF within the Peck and 65,000 USF in leased space. IRS needs to consolidate space, and plans to do so by completely eliminating the 65,000 USF of leased space and reconfiguring space within the Peck to implement new workplace strategies.  They have requested a total of approximately 115,000 USF of space in the Peck Building to accommodate this move and restacking effort. GSA proposes that 4 other agencies move leases into the Peck building with the following approximated space requirements: DOE at 75,000 sq ft, US Trustees at 4,200 sq ft, SSA ODAR at 21,000 sq ft, and OSHA at 6,500 sq ft. This project will aim to achieve LEED &shy;CI Gold and is currently registered under LEED Version 2009. The NAICS code for this procurement is 236220.</p>
<p><br />The CMc shall be a member of the project development team during the design and construction phases. The CMc selected for this project shall work along with the GSA and GSA's selected Architect and Engineer (A/E) firm, Commissioning Agent (CxA), and Construction Manager as Agent (CMa). The services requested of the CMc shall cover a wide range of design and construction activities, such as: constructability reviews, cost estimating, work phasing reviews, scheduling and general construction services. The CMc is at risk and is responsible for involvement in the project development and administration of the construction.</p>
<p><br />Definition of Construction Manager as Constructor: A CMc contractor is defined as a firm engaged under direct contract to a building owner or client (in this case the GSA) to provide services such as design review, cost estimating, sustainability review, scheduling and general construction services. The services requested of the CMc shall cover a wide range of design and construction activities which are often performed by both Construction Managers (CMs) and General Contractors (GCs). In contrast to a CM that is not also a constructor; the CMc is at risk and is involved with project development and administration of the construction. The CMc shall be a member of the project development team during the design and construction phases, working with the A/E and the Government to ensure a quality project, within the mandated schedule and budget. The CMc contractor will perform services including, but not limited to: evaluating design concepts, monitoring A/E progress, coordinating design reviews, reviewing designs, reviewing and preparing cost estimates, controlling schedules, keeping records, reporting on design and construction progress, conducting Value Engineering (VE) exercises, conducting constructability reviews, constructing the facility at or below the Estimated Construction Cost at Award (ECCA), administering the construction contract and all subcontracts, coordinating construction meetings, CPM scheduling, monitoring construction costs and performing administrative and other services as defined in the scope of work to provide for a completely functional facility.</p>
<p><br />There are two components of work to be performed under this Contract: Design Phase Services and Construction Phase Services. The Contractor is required to complete the Design Phase Services for the firm-fixed-price set forth in the Contract Price Schedule. If the Government exercises the option for the Construction Phase Services, the contractor shall complete the Construction Phase Services at or below the Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP).</p>
<p><br />Joint Ventures: Joint venture or firm/ consultant arrangements will be considered and must submit an acceptable joint venture agreement.</p>
<p><br />The solicitation package will be available on or about June 10, 2016. The solicitation package will only be available electronically. Potential Offerors will be responsible for downloading the solicitation from the FedBizOpps website, https://www.fbo.gov, and for monitoring for possible amendments and/or additional information.</p>
<p><br />A pre-proposal conference and site-visit will be held in Cincinnati, Ohio approximately three weeks after the solicitation is issued. A link to the Pre-Proposal Registration Form will be included in the solicitation posting, and anyone interested in attending the pre-proposal conference shall complete the form and submit it no later than one week prior to the pre-proposal conference. Please note, the number of people attending will be limited to three individuals per company/team. We consider attendance at this conference vital to the preparation of a competitive and cost effective proposal and to understanding the total result desired by the Government. Failure to attend this meeting may not be used as an excuse for omissions or miscalculations in offers. The offers will be due on or about July 11, 2016.</p>
<p><br />All responsible sources may submit a bid/proposal which shall be considered by the agency. In order to be eligible for award offerors are required to provide electronic representations and certifications in the System for Award Management (SAM), which can be accessed at: https://www.sam.gov.

2.	Vendor RFQ Instructions:

a)	In order to maintain the vendor email group, all HTME ID/IQ contractors are required to submit the following information to Mr. Matthew Craig at Matthew.Craig3@va.gov.

1)	Contract Administrator:  Provide the name, address and email of the current contract administrator.  
2)	Provide the current contact information (name and email address) to be included on e-mail notifications regarding HTME updates and Consolidations.  

b)	During the solicitation phase following the May 20, 2016 FBO posting and prior to the June 23, 2016 submission of vendor quotes, all communication regarding the May 2016 consolidation shall be coordinated through the NAC consolidation coordinator, Reagan Criddle at reagan.criddle@va.gov.  This includes all requests for clarification or additional information from vendors.  

During the evaluation phase, communication can be coordinated by the local/VISN Contracting Officer.  This includes all clarifications or additional information that is required to complete evaluations.  The local Contracting Officer will determine what access, if any, is needed by the vendors to obtain information and shall be present at all vendor presentations.  Presentations are meant to clarify the understanding of equipment features in the quote.  Prices or additional equipment or features shall not be discussed.  Thus, once communications have begun with vendors relating to a specific quote, Contracting Officers must control those communications in order to ensure that those vendors are treated fairly and given the same opportunity. 

Unless the local Contracting Officer requires clarification or additional information to complete the evaluation (including vendor presentations), all communications are through the NAC Contracting Officer.  In addition, all other communications not related to local requirements must be coordinated through the NAC Contracting Officer.  

c)	The NAC Contracting Officers will review the station's recommended source selection justifications and determine whether or not the justification is adequate to award the order or if additional information from the station is required before an award can be executed.  Communication during this time will be through NAC Contracting Officers only.  We have advised our customers that when the selection process begins there is to be no further contact with vendors regarding their requirements.  Information such as members of the evaluation panel is considered confidential source selection information and may not be disclosed.

d)	We ask that vendors forward the above information to their respective sales team so that all are aware of the process and timelines. 

e)	We also ask that you do not contact the NAC regarding the status of selections as this will only delay the process.  After the NAC has reviewed and finalized all vendor selections for a VISN, an update providing the selections for that VISN will be issued.

f)	The May 2016 Consolidation will not have phases.

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1<br />JPEO-CBD REMOTE SENSING FOR CBRN DETECTION REQUEST FOR INFORMATION<br />TECHNOLOGY READINESS LEVELS<br />Technology Readiness Levels are a set of nine graded definitions or a description of states of technology maturity. They were originated by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and adapted by the Department of Defense (DoD) for use in its acquisition systems. A copy of the definitions is provided below for convenience and can also be accessed at:<br />http://www.acq.osd.mil/chieftechnologist/publications/docs/TRA2011.pdf<br />TRL Definition Description Supporting Information <br />1 Basic principles observed and reported. Lowest level of technology readiness. Scientific research begins to be translated into applied research and development (R&amp;D). Examples might include paper studies of a technology's basic properties. Published research that identifies the principles that underlie this technology. References to who, where, when. <br />2 Technology concept and/or application formulated. Invention begins. Once basic principles are observed, practical applications can be invented. Applications are speculative, and there may be no proof or detailed analysis to support the assumptions. Examples are limited to analytic studies. Publications or other references that out-line the application being considered and that provide analysis to support the concept. <br />3 Analytical and experimental critical function and/or characteristic proof of concept. Active R&amp;D is initiated. This includes analytical studies and laboratory studies to physically validate the analytical predictions of separate elements of the technology. Examples include components that are not yet integrated or representative. Results of laboratory tests performed to measure parameters of interest and comparison to analytical predictions for critical subsystems. References to who, where, and when these tests and comparisons were performed. <br />4 Component and/or breadboard validation in a laboratory environment. Basic technological components are integrated to establish that they will work together. This is relatively "low fidelity" compared with the eventual system. Examples include integration of "ad hoc" hardware in the laboratory. System concepts that have been considered and results from testing laboratory-scale breadboard(s). References to who did this work and when. Provide an estimate of how breadboard hardware and test results differ from the expected system goals. <br />5 Component and/or breadboard validation in a relevant environment. Fidelity of breadboard technology increases significantly. The basic technological components are integrated with reasonably realistic supporting elements so they can be tested in a simulated environment. Examples include "high-fidelity" laboratory integration of components. Results from testing laboratory breadboard system are integrated with other supporting elements in a simulated operational environment. How does the "relevant environment" differ from the expected operational environment? How do the test results compare with expectations? What problems, if any, were encountered? Was the breadboard system refined to more nearly match the expected system goals? <br />&emsp;<br />TRL Definition Description Supporting Information <br />6 System/subsystem model or prototype demonstration in a relevant environment. Representative model or prototype system, which is well beyond that of TRL 5, is tested in a relevant environment. Represents a major step up in a technology's demonstrated readiness. Examples include testing a prototype in a high-fidelity laboratory environment or in a simulated operational environment. <br />Results from laboratory testing of a proto-type system that is near the desired con-figuration in terms of performance, weight, and volume. How did the test environment differ from the operational environment? Who performed the tests? How did the test compare with expectations? What problems, if any, were encountered? What are/were the plans, options, or actions to resolve problems before moving to the next level? <br /><br />7 System prototype demonstration in an operational environment. Prototype near or at planned operational system. Represents a major step up from TRL 6 by requiring demonstration of an actual system prototype in an operational environment (e.g., in an air-craft, in a vehicle, or in space). Results from testing a prototype system in an operational environment. Who per-formed the tests? How did the test com-pare with expectations? What problems, if any, were encountered? What are/were the plans, options, or actions to resolve problems before moving to the next level? <br />8 Actual system completed and qualified through test and demonstration. Technology has been proven to work in its final form and under expected conditions. In almost all cases, this TRL represents the end of true system development. Examples include developmental test and evaluation (DT&amp;E) of the system in its intended weapon system to deter-mine if it meets design specifications. Results of testing the system in its final configuration under the expected range of environmental conditions in which it will be expected to operate. Assessment of whether it will meet its operational requirements. What problems, if any, were encountered? What are/were the plans, options, or actions to resolve problems before finalizing the design? <br />9 Actual system proven through successful mission operations. Actual application of the technology in its final form and under mission conditions, such as those encountered in operational test and evaluation (OT&amp;E). Examples include using the system under operational mission conditions. OT&amp;E reports</p>
<p>Clarifying Definitions:<br />BREADBOARD: Integrated components that provide a representation of a system/subsystem and which can be used to determine concept feasibility and to develop technical data. They are typically configured for laboratory use to demonstrate the technical principles of immediate interest and may resemble final system/subsystem in function only.<br />HIGH FIDELITY: Addresses form, fit, and function. A high fidelity laboratory environment would involve testing with equipment that can simulate and validate all system specifications within a laboratory setting.<br />LOW FIDELITY: A representative of the component or system that has limited ability to provide anything but first order information about the end product. Low fidelity assessments are used to provide trend analysis.<br />MODEL: A reduced scale, functional form of a system, near or at operational specification. Models will be sufficiently hardened to allow demonstration of the technical and operational capabilities required of the final system.<br />OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT: Environment that addresses all of the operational requirements and specifications required of the final system to include platform/packaging.</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION: This announcement constitutes an official Request For Information (RFI). This is a request for information only, as defined in FAR 15.201(e) regarding exchanges with industry before receipt of proposal.
<p>This RFI is issued for market research and for planning purposes only, and shall not be considered a Request for Proposal (RFP) or Invitation for Bid (IFB); an obligation from the U.S. Government (USG) to acquire any products or services; or an authorization to incur any cost in anticipation of such authorization. The USG does not intend to reimburse respondents for information solicited or for costs of any other activities associated with responding to this RFI, including participation in any demonstration. The information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the USG to pursue any course of action described herein.</p>
<p>Purpose:<br />The purpose of this RFI is to gain knowledge of interest, capabilities, and qualifications of participants for the described below effort. The intent of this RFI is to identify market interest and solicit recommendations for potential extended range missile technology materiel solutions. The USG will assess system level capabilities, as well as critical component technologies against their capability to meet extended range missile operational needs. Successful participation in system level or component based demonstrations of Insensitive Munitions (IM) compliant and cluster munition policy compliant warheads and rocket motors will inform the USG on maturity of existing technologies.</p>
<p>The Army Program Executive Office, Missiles and Space (PEO MS), Redstone Arsenal, AL, on the behalf of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology (ASAALT), has partnered with the Precision Fires Rocket and Missile Systems (PFRMS) Project Office, Fort Sill Fires Center of Excellence (FCoE) and the US Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) to host a series of demonstrations that will conclude at the end of calendar year 2016. The Army desires to assess the maturity of industry investments in system level concepts as well as IM compliant and cluster munition policy compliant warhead and rocket motor technologies that may inform future acquisition decisions for the Army.</p>
<p>Objectives:<br />PEO Missiles and Space is inviting industry to participate in demonstrations to be conducted at various test venues in calendar year 2016. The USG will develop a list of evaluation criteria for all materiel solutions that will be briefed at a forthcoming Industry Day. The evaluation criteria will form the basis for post-demonstration assessments of system level, warhead and rocket motor performance and effectiveness. Potential participants must verify readiness to participate by addressing the following criteria:</p>
<p>&bull; Both demonstrated and predicted system/component capabilities<br />&bull; Expected performance and effectiveness of system/component<br />&bull; Test asset availability<br />&bull; System/component physical properties<br />&bull; Future planned upgrades<br />&bull; Development schedule and milestones<br />&bull; Specific test support requirements<br />&bull; Insensitive Munitions compliance<br />&bull; Test safety considerations<br />&bull; Other information about the participant's system/component that the USG should know</p>
<p>All potential participants should note that the USG, with contractor support, will plan and execute system level, warhead and rocket motor testing, conduct a limited Army IM board assessment, conduct a cluster munition policy compliant assessment and provide an independent evaluation of demonstration results by AMRDEC to PEO MS and to the PFRMS Project Office.<br /><br />Missile, Warhead and Rocket Motor Demonstrations.<br />Warhead testing will be conducted at Camden, AR. The USG will provide lethality maps and request the terminal conditions (angle of fall) of the warhead. There will be a single arena test conducted for each participant and the USG will evaluate the fragmentation data against a specified target set. Rocket motor testing will be conducted at Redstone Test Center, Huntsville, AL, and will include a hot, cold, and ambient test. Missile flight tests will be conducted at either Eglin AFB, FL or White Sands Missile Range, NM. All required safety documentation for participating in any of these events will be the responsibility of the participant. AMRDEC will provide an independent assessment of the testing and data collected during the demonstration. Additional details of each demonstration will be provided at the forthcoming Industry Day. There will be schedule constraints associated with each demonstration but each participant will be provided ample time for shipping, component set-up, demonstration execution and tear-down.</p>
<p>Participants must be aware that technical interchange meetings and all test venue locations will have visit request requirements for facility/test access. Participants will agree to conduct all phases of planning and demonstration in accordance with security and safety requirements at respective planning and demonstration locations. Participants should also note that the USG will approve all public statements, photos, and videos relating to these demonstrations prior to release.</p>
<p>Test Data:<br />Test data will be collected at each test location by the USG and copies of the respective participant data set will be provided to each respective participant. Data products that the USG plans to collect will be briefed at the Industry day. Certain data products collected by the participant will be requested to be provided to the USG prior to departing each test location. Each participant will be requested to provide data in engineering units to the USG to assist in the assessment of the demonstrations. Any data collected by the USG will be the property of the USG. Participants may be asked to grant limited data rights on the data they deliver to the USG. The USG will work with each participant to determine the classification level of data products and appropriate proprietary markings.

The intent of the RFI is to allow potential vendors to determine whether or how they can satisfy these requirements and to permit NOAA to obtain the best value for such services. <br />Overview<br />The purpose of the NOAA Medium Earth Orbiting Search and Rescue (MEOSAR) system<br />is to provide distress alert and location data, using spacecraft and ground facilities, to Search and Rescue Coordination Centers (RCCs) operated by the US Air Force and US Coast Guard,  in near real-time. The contractor must provide engineering services, as requested, to support the modernization and evolution of the two (2) NOAA Medium-Earth Orbiting Local User Terminals (MEOLUTs) while the International Cospas-Sarsat Demonstration and Evaluation (D&amp;E) testing is being completed and the effort to establish an Initial Operating Capability is undertaken.  The contractor must provide on-call 24/7/365 operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) support for the NOAA Search and Rescue Satellite-Aided Tracking (SARSAT) program's MEOLUT ground stations, one, located in Miami, Florida and the other in Honolulu, Hawaii. This vendor's O&amp;M support shall insure that the MEOLUTs accurately tracks operational Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) satellites, receives, processes and relays beacon distress messages, in coordination with the NOAA managed United States Mission Control Center (USMCC), to the appropriate RCCs via US Government provided communication links.
<p>The Contractor shall provide engineering support services, as an option, on a per year basis for up to 5 years (1 base year and 4 additional option years) as directed by NOAA to support efforts in the evolution of the system as it becomes operational, world-wide, within the International Cospas-Sarsat program.  Changes in DOC, NOAA, NESDIS and Cospas-Sarsat IT policies, the MEOSAR space segment constellations, the modernization of the communication infrastructure and changing protocols shall be evaluated and implemented, by the vendor, at the direction of the US SARSAT program, without jeopardizing the existing operational capabilities of the MEOSAR system and the HI and FLA MEOLUTs.</p>
<p>The contractor shall maintain a spare parts inventory which requires auditing the existing spare parts inventory on-site in HI and FLA, and restocking used inventory, as required, on a yearly basis, in order to facilitate the timely replacement of failed hardware and restoring operational capability. The beacon simulator, UPS batteries and air conditioning (HVAC) units at both sites are considered integral parts of the MEOLUTs operation at both sites. <br />The hardware components of these systems are from the original build and also have limited spare parts kits on-site at both locations. O&amp;M support requires having a contractor with the proper knowledge and expertise to monitor, diagnose and replace failed components, in an expedited manner in order to maintain the national critical, life-saving capabilities of the system.  The software that manages the data processing, location processing and delivery of alerts to the U. S. Mission Control Center is proprietary property of the original vendor(s).  NOAA seeks information relating to the capabilities of potential vendors related to providing O&amp;M support for these existing systems, including the upgrade of hardware and the existing proprietary software, and the installing of spare parts or other components as required.<br />Information Requested<br />All potential sources are invited and encouraged to submit a response to this notice. The vendor's response should reflect an understanding of the NOAA requirements and the mission of the Agency without divulging proprietary information, if possible. If proprietary information is provided in a response, it should be clearly identified. All proprietary information submitted by respondents will be safeguarded and protected from unauthorized disclosure. The Government reserves the right to conduct additional one-to-one communications with respondents in order to fully understand their recommendations/feedback. <br />Additional Information<br />The response should include addressing the above questions/comments as well as a description of their capabilities and experience O&amp;M support for Medium Earth Orbiting Local User Terminals. Vendors shall include an explanation of their specific ability to support the existing proprietary software systems, including any teaming or subcontract relationships necessary to meet the requirements. Please include information regarding the type of business, (i.e. large, small, Woman-owned, Veteran or Disadvantaged business concern). The North American Industry Classification system (NAICS) code for this notice is 517410: Satellite Telecommunications. However, the final request for proposal and resultant contract(s) may be assigned a different NAICS code. All firms responding should state their status for the appropriate NAICS codes. The NAICS codes cited in the RFI are for internal business size stratification purposes only. <br />Vendor responses should identify a point of contact including the representative's name, company, email address, mailing address and telephone number both in an email and within the body of the submitted document. Please limit your response to this RFI to three (3) pages or less.<br />Submission<br />Submission of Response should be directed to the following email address not later than November 16th at 2:00 PM Pacific Time to Sarah Waugh, Contract Specialist, via email at sarah.waugh@noaa.gov.<br />ALL INFORMATION PROVIDED IN RESPONSE TO THIS RFI WILL BE USED FOR INFORMATIONAL AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. ALL INFORMATION SUBMITTED IS RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS VOLUNTARY. THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT WILL NOT PAY FOR INFORMATION REQUESTED NOR WILL IT COMPENSATE ANY RESPONDENT FOR ANY COST INCURRED IN DEVELOPING INFORMATION PROVIDED TO THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT.</p>

WDAMS COTS SaaS - Annual subscription COTS SaaS license with 24/7 help desk, system maintenance and support including software updates and upgrades. 	1	YR  BACKGROUND  The Naval Postgraduate School (NPS), located in Monterey, California, is a fully accredited graduate-level university that supports the U.S. Navy, other military branches, and foreign military services with masters and PhD level education for personnel. Additionally, NPS provides significant research capabilities to the Department of Defense (DoD), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and other agencies.  NPS consists of four graduate schools: International Graduate Studies, Business and Public Policy, Operational and Information Sciences, and Engineering and Applied Sciences; three research and education institutes (Meyer Institute of Systems Engineering; Cebrowski Institute; and the Modeling Virtual Environments and Simulation Institute) as well as other NPS research and education centers.   Dudley Knox Library (DKL) is the academic library at NPS and provides scholarly content, systems, and associated services relevant to NPS instructional and research needs.   DKL has 30 library staff who serve approximately 6,000 active patron accounts in our current integrated library system (ILS).  DKL manages and provides access to more than:  	600,762 Print and Electronic Books  	3,178 Media      	18,690 Microforms      	10,000 Print and Electronic Serials Machine-Readable Catalogue (MARC) Records plus holdings (active and inactive subscriptions)  	75,493 Active Unique Targets in Ex Libris SFX 	489 Databases (includes commercial, government and free)    OBJECTIVE  DKL requires a fully operational, UNCLASSIFIED, turnkey cloud-based, hosted library discovery, access and management system (WDAMS) for public and staff use that is Commercial Off-the Shelf Software as a Service [COTS SaaS]).

		Servicing performing loans (Basis points per loan)
		Servicing non-performing loans (Basis points per loan)
		Servicing Reimbursable

<DESC>The US Army Contracting Command APG, Natick Contracting Division, on behalf of the US Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center, Combat Feeding Directorate, intends to award a firm fixed price contract under FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) only one responsible source to Carol S Willey, 91 Floral St, Shrewsbury, MA, 01545-3223 for Nutrition Analysis. The US Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center, Combat Feeding Directorate, intends to award a firm fixed price contract to Carol S Willey because the US Army Contracting Command APG requires a highly specialized nutritional analysis taking into account nutrient losses and/or uptakes affected by various food preparations and cooking processes. Very few people understand how to apply these factors to a recipe. Carol Willey has been working for the Armed Forces Recipe Service as a Food Technologist and Registered Dietician for the past two years and is familiar with the project's specific needs. Ms. Willey has over 16 years of experience as a full time Nutrient Database Specialist with the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston and has a unique skill as a nutrient data base researcher, specializing in working with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) nutrient database standard release nutrition codes.
<p>The services required for this current procurement are to:<br />1. Update the current Armed Forces Recipe Service's (AFRS) by applying major revisions to multiple existing recipes and incorporating new recipes into the collection. <br />2. Perform detailed nutrient analysis of all new and updated recipes during, and at the completion of the testing/development phase and will update the recipe files with the final nutrition data. The purpose of the nutrient analysis is to ensure that the updated and new recipes result in the nutrition-related outcomes.<br />3. Utilize the new nutrition analysis/recipe development software to enter required data (ingredients and nutrient links, legacy and new AFRS recipes) to fully populate the database in order to make it ready for use by all services and DLA.<br />4. Aid in applying go for Green&reg; color codes to all AFRS recipes.</p>
<p>Overall, the goal of the proposed work will be to provide support to the AFRS team by populating the new software database with existing AFRS data and by generating nutrient analysis for new and updated recipes at various stages of development and at completion using approved nutrition analysis software.</p>

<RESPDATE>061316
<CONTACT>Tara L. Casey, Phone 4102780863, Email tara.l.casey.civ@mail.mil
<DESC>The U.S. Army intends to extend Engility Corporation contract W91CRB-13-C-0021 by 18 months on a sole source basis. This will allow performance to continue until 30 June 2018, to support Afghanistan operations for the United States Army. A Justification and Approval document will be prepared for the extension under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. Specifically, this extension falls under paragraph (a)(2)(iii)(A) where contracts for the Department of Defense may be deemed available only from the original source for the continued provision of highly specialized services when it likely that award to any other source would result in the substantial duplication of costs that is not expected to be recovered by any competition savings.
<p>This contract is for highly trained law enforcement professionals (LEPs) to instruct and facilitate U.S. forces to understand, identify, target, penetrate, interdict, and suppress criminal-like, insurgent network enterprises and special group criminals. This knowledge is then shared with Host Nation Security Forces.</p>
<p>Contractor personnel are classified as LEP 1s and LEP 2s. LEP 1s must have a minimum of 20 years of law enforcement experience with at least 10 years of investigative experience. They must possess specialized investigative experience in the field(s) of gang control/suppression, organized crime, controlled substance organizations, international money laundering, counter terrorism and/or public corruption. In addition, LEP 1s must be able to obtain a Top Secret security clearance and have documented experience as supervisors, managers or task force leads in a federal agency, federal task force, state agency or large police department. LEP 2s must possess 10 years of law enforcement experience reflecting the ability to identify and to investigate structure, methods, and behaviors of organized crime networks, gangs, terrorist organizations, drug organizations and/or public corruption. All LEPs must have the mental and physical abilities required to work in Afghanistan for 12 months at a time.</p>
<p>If this contract is not extended, there will be a significant duplication of costs. A 90-day transition period would be required to allow for the setup of a Country Management Team in Afghanistan and the current requirement for the recruitment and training of 14 LEPs and one country manager. Bringing back the current OCONUS personnel and redeploying 15 personnel to Afghanistan will be costly. The administrative costs of issuing Letters of Authorization, obtaining clearances, processing personnel through Fort Bliss, issuing equipment, and processing arming documents are substantial, as are reprocurement costs.</p>
<p>Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the notice. This notice of intent is not a request for information. However, all capability statements received will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Responses must be sent by 13 June 2016 by 1000 to Tara Casey at tara.l.casey.civ@mail.mil and should include information about experience and corporate resources to indicate capability of providing these specialized services in a combat zone.</p>

<p>CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT</p>
<p><br />SUP 5252.204-9400 Contractor Unclassified Access to Federally Controlled Facilities, Sensitive Information, Information Technology (IT) Systems or Protected Health Information (July 2013)</p>
<p>Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-12, requires government agencies to develop and implement Federal security standards for Federal employees and contractors. The Deputy Secretary of Defense Directive-Type Memorandum (DTM) 08-006 - "DoD Implementation of Homeland Security Presidential Directive - 12 (HSPD-12)" dated November 26, 2008 (or its subsequent DoD instruction) directs implementation of HSPD-12. This clause is in accordance with HSPD-12 and its implementing directives.</p>
<p>APPLICABILITY <br />This clause applies to contractor employees requiring physical access to any area of a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoN or DoD computer/network/system to perform certain unclassified sensitive duties. This clause also applies to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information, provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified by DON as National Security Position, as advised by the command security manager. It is the responsibility of the responsible security officer of the command/facility where the work is performed to ensure compliance.</p>
<p>Each contractor employee providing services at a Navy Command under this contract is required to obtain a Department of Defense Common Access Card (DoD CAC). Additionally, depending on the level of computer/network access, the contract employee will require a successful investigation as detailed below.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO FEDERAL FACILITIES <br />Per HSPD-12 and implementing guidance, all contractor employees working at a federally controlled base, facility or activity under this clause will require a DoD CAC. When access to a base, facility or activity is required contractor employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the Navy Command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract.</p>
<p>ACCESS TO DOD IT SYSTEMS <br />In accordance with SECNAV M-5510.30, contractor employees who require access to DoN or DoD networks are categorized as IT-I, IT-II, or IT-III. The IT-II level, defined in detail in SECNAV M-5510.30, includes positions which require access to information protected under the Privacy Act, to include Protected Health Information (PHI). All contractor employees under this contract who require access to Privacy Act protected information are therefore categorized no lower than IT-II. IT Levels are determined by the requiring activity's Command Information Assurance Manager. Contractor employees requiring privileged or IT-I level access, (when specified by the terms of the contract) require a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) which is a higher level investigation than the National Agency Check with Law and Credit (NACLC) described below. Due to the privileged system access, a SSBI suitable for High Risk public trusts positions is required. Individuals who have access to system control, monitoring, or administration functions (e.g. system administrator, database administrator) require training and certification to Information Assurance Technical Level 1, and must be trained and certified on the Operating System or Computing Environment they are required to maintain.</p>
<p>Access to sensitive IT systems is contingent upon a favorably adjudicated background investigation. When access to IT systems is required for performance of the contractor employee's duties, such employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The decision to authorize access to a government IT system/network is inherently governmental. The contractor supervisor is not authorized to sign the SAAR-Ni therefore, the government employee with knowledge of the system/network access required or the COR shall sign the SAAR-N as the "supervisor".</p>
<p>The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date may result in delaying the individual's start date.</p>
<p>When required to maintain access to required IT systems or networks, the contractor shall ensure that all employees requiring access complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p>INTERIM ACCESS <br />The Navy Command' s Security Manager may authorize issuance of a DoD CAC and interim access to a DoN or DoD unclassified computer/network upon a favorable review of the investigative questionnaire and advance favorable fingerprint results. When the results of the investigation are received and a favorable determination is not made, the contractor employee working on the contract under interim access will be denied access to the computer network and this denial will not relieve the contractor of his/her responsibility to perform.</p>
<p>DENIAL OR TERMINATION OF ACCESS <br />The potential consequences of any requirement under this clause including denial or termination of physical or system access in no way relieves the contractor from the requirement to execute performance under the contract within the timeframes specified in the contract. Contractors shall plan ahead in processing their employees and subcontractor employees. The contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is permitted to have unclassified access to a federally controlled facility, federally-controlled information system/network and/or to government information, meaning information not authorized for public release.</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR'S SECURITY REPRESENTATIVE <br />The contractor shall designate an employee to serve as the Contractor's Security Representative. Within three work days after contract award, the contractor shall provide to the requiring activity's Security Manager and the Contracting Officer, in writing, the name, title, address and phone number for the Contractor's Security Representative. The Contractor's Security Representative shall be the primary point of contact on any security matter. The Contractor's Security Representative shall not be replaced or removed without prior notice to the Contracting Officer and Command Security Manager.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS AND SECURITY APPROVAL PROCESS FOR CONTRACTORS ASSIGNED TO NATIONAL SECURITY POSITIONS OR PERFORMING SENSITIVE DUTIES <br />Navy security policy requires that all positions be given a sensitivity value based on level of risk factors to ensure appropriate protective measures are applied. Navy recognizes contractor employees under this contract as Non-Critical Sensitive [ADP/IT-II] when the contract scope of work require physical access to a federally controlled base, facility or activity and/or requiring access to a DoD computer/network, to perform unclassified sensitive duties. This designation is also applied to contractor employees who access Privacy Act and Protected Health Information (PHI), provide support associated with fiduciary duties, or perform duties that have been identified by DON as National Security Positions. At a minimum, each contractor employee must be a US citizen and have a favorably completed NACLC to obtain a favorable determination for assignment to a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position. The NACLC consists of a standard NAC and a FBI fingerprint check plus law enforcement checks and credit check. Each contractor employee filling a non-critical sensitive or IT-II position is required to complete:</p>
<p>* SF-86 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (or equivalent OPM investigative product) <br />* Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards (or an electronic fingerprint submission) <br />* Original Signed Release Statements</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date. Background investigations shall be reinitiated as required to ensure investigations remain current (not older than 10 years) throughout the contract performance period. The Contractor's Security Representative shall contact the Command Security Manager for guidance when reinvestigations are required.</p>
<p>Regardless of their duties or IT access requirements ALL contractor employees shall in-process with the Navy Command's Security Manager upon arrival to the Navy command and shall out-process prior to their departure at the completion of the individual's performance under the contract. Employees requiring IT access shall also check-in and check-out with the Navy Command's Information Assurance Manager. Completion and approval of a System Authorization Access Request Navy (SAAR-N) form is required for all individuals accessing Navy Information Technology resources. The SAAR-N shall be forwarded to the Navy Command's Security Manager at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date. Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date shall result in delaying the individual's start date.</p>
<p>The contractor shall ensure that each contract employee requiring access to IT systems or networks complete annual Information Assurance (IA) training, and maintain a current requisite background investigation. Contractor employees shall accurately complete the required investigative forms prior to submission to the Navy Command Security Manager. The Navy Command's Security Manager will review the submitted documentation for completeness prior to submitting it to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Suitability/security issues identified by the Navy may render the contractor employee ineligible for the assignment. An unfavorable determination made by the Navy is final (subject to SF-86 appeal procedures) and such a determination does not relieve the contractor from meeting any contractual obligation under the contract. The Navy Command's Security Manager will forward the required forms to OPM for processing. Once the investigation is complete, the results will be forwarded by OPM to the DON Central Adjudication Facility (CAF) for a determination.</p>
<p>If the contractor employee already possesses a current favorably adjudicated investigation, the contractor shall submit a Visit Authorization Request (VAR) via the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) or a hard copy VAR directly from the contractor's Security Representative. Although the contractor will take JPAS "Owning" role over the contractor employee, the Navy Command will take JPAS "Servicing" role over the contractor employee during the hiring process and for the duration of assignment under that contract. The contractor shall include the IT Position Category per SECNAV M-5510.30 for each employee designated on a VAR. The VAR requires annual renewal for the duration of the employee's performance under the contract.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS AND SECURITY APPROVAL PROCESS FOR CONTRACTORS ASSIGNED TO OR PERFORMING NON-SENSITIVE DUTIES <br />Contractor employee whose work is unclassified and non-sensitive (e.g., performing certain duties such as lawn maintenance, vendor services, etc ...) and who require physical access to publicly accessible areas to perform those duties shall meet the following minimum requirements:</p>
<p>* Must be either a US citizen or a US permanent resident with a minimum of 3 years legal residency in the United States (as required by The Deputy Secretary of Defense DTM 08-006 or its subsequent DoD instruction) and <br />* Must have a favorably completed National Agency Check with Written Inquiries (NACI) including a FBI fingerprint check prior to installation access.</p>
<p>To be considered for a favorable trustworthiness determination, the Contractor's Security Representative must submit for all employees each of the following:</p>
<p>* SF-85 Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions <br />* Two FD-258 Applicant Fingerprint Cards (or an electronic fingerprint submission) <br />* Original Signed Release Statements</p>
<p>The contractor shall ensure each individual employee has a current favorably completed National Agency Check with Written Inquiries (NACI) or ensure successful FBI fingerprint results have been gained and investigation has been processed with OPM.</p>
<p>Failure to provide the required documentation at least 30 days prior to the individual's start date may result in delaying the individual's start date.</p>
<p>* Consult with your Command Security Manager and Information Assurance Manager for local policy when IT-III (non-sensitive) access is required for non-US citizens outside the United States.<br /><br />Section E - Inspection and Acceptance</p>

The objective of this work is to provide the means for estimating harvest rates, seasonal survival rates, and movement probabilities for black ducks, mallards, and hybrids in eastern North America.  These estimates will allow the Black Duck Joint Venture and its partners to develop accurate population models to inform harvest and habitat management decisions.  The mission of the BDJV is to implement and coordinate cooperative population monitoring, research, and communication programs to provide information required to manage black ducks and restore numbers to the North American Waterfowl Management Plan goal.  The BDJV is currently implementing a two-season banding program to improve estimates of survival, harvest rates, and movement probabilities to address key uncertainties in black duck ecology and management.  Banding crews consisting of federal and provincial agency staff, and nongovernment personnel carry out the work in Ontario, Quebec, and the Atlantic provinces of Canada, Ohio, Tennessee, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina.  The Contractor must have well established working relationships with the provincial and federal governments in Canada and state wildlife agencies in the jurisdictions identified in the previous section.  The Contractor must also have established methods of transferring funds with the identified jurisdictions.  This requirement will be a Base Year plus two no-cost Option Years.

The proposed contract is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b).  

All responsible sources may identify their interest and capability for this requirement by responding to this announcement. All proposals received within fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>NASA Johnson Space Center has a requirement for WB57 Aircraft, Payloads and Missions. Services performed under this purchase order will include WB-57 aircrew duties, pre-mission preparation and post-mission support, WB-57 data-link and communications support, WB-57 network and information assurance, and support of the WB-57 Communications Security (COSMEC) Responsible Officer (CRO). This support requires specialized aircrew skills (e.g. qualified and experienced WB-57 Sensor Equipment Operator with Full Pressure Suite qualification), extensive knowledge of the WB-57 aircraft communications and network systems, proficiency with the WB-57 DyNAMITE optical sensor, and access to experts in the field of Beyond Line-of-Site (BLOS) communications and airborne networks that is not readily available in the general community.
<p><br />NASA Johnson Space Center intends to purchase the items from Curved Skies, LLC. The contractor possesses highly unique and innovative skills, aircraft knowledge, technical expertise and period experience in the areas of WB-57 aircrew duties, WB-57 communications and network systems, WB-57 COSMEC management, and DyNAMITE optical sensor operations. The work being requested under this purchase order is specific to the WB-57 Program, and requires a seamless transition of services beginning June 01, 2016. Curved Skies, LLC is the only company in existence with the capabilities required to support the entire set of services stated in this purchase order.</p>
<p>Curved Skies, LLC has provided aircrew, communications and network system expertise, mission and COSMEC support, and DyNAMITE optical sensor operations support to the WB-57 Program since February 2014. The training necessary to duplicate this effort with a different vendor would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that would not be recovered through competition. The technical and operational expertise required by this acquisition resides solely at Curved Skies, LLCC.</p>
<p>The results of market research conducted by the requiring organization and knowledge of the capabilities of various contractors working on similar projects have yielded the determination that, due to the unique qualifications required for this effort, no other sources are capable of providing these services in a timely manner.</p>
<p><br />The Government does&nbsp;intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.</p>
<p><br />Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on May 24, 2016. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.</p>
<p><br />Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>
<p><br />All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html.</p>

This will allow the USPFO-GA Purchasing and Contracting Office to permit&nbsp;INL to train the 4th WMD-CST. The training will include a Radiation Dispersal Device (RDD) Course which&nbsp;is a unique training event involving the detonation of a RDD type bomb in a controlled environment. Radiological incident management is one of the core tasks for WMD-CST units. This training will allow the 4th WMD-CST to conduct actual field tests of the effects of a RDD detonation with currently utilized equipment and doctrine. The device also uses radiological isotopes with a high potential of use during a terrorism event in CONUS. This training is developmental in nature as RDD has never been detonated in CONUS and will shape future TTP's for United States CBRNE response forces. Completion of the course will advance the preparedness of the 4th WMD-CST. <br /><br />The Statutory Authority permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition (except brand name) for this action is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as cited in FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.

<p>Issue Date: 13 MAY 2016 - Closing Date: 27 MAY 2016 - 2:00 PM EDT</p>
<p><br />The Government is issuing this RFI as part of market research for the procurement of Contractor Support Services (CSS) and Interim Sustainment Support (ISS) supplies/services for the Target Sight System (TSS). The TSS is a night vision system utilized on the KC-130J Fixed Wing aircraft referred to as Harvest Hawk (HH).</p>
<p>This RFI is being posted to assist in determining the appropriate contract strategy to fulfill a Government requirement. The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, anticipates awarding a four year basic ordering agreement (BOA) in support of the TSS on the HH aircraft. Currently the USG knows of only one firm (Lockheed Martin Corporation, Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control, Orlando, Florida) capable of meeting the requirements. As such the Government currently intends to award, on a sole source basis, to the only know source, Lockheed Martin in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. The basis for restricting competition is proprietary information/data rights owned by Lockheed Martin, duplicative cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, and the unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency requirement through any other source. The Government does not own complete level three drawings or data rights for the TSS. <br /><br />The Government is seeking information from companies mitigating the sole source basis listed above. The Government is seeking companies with the capabilities and facilities to provide CSS and ISS supplies/services for the TSS.</p>
<p>All interested parties are encouraged to submit company and product literature, a white paper no longer than 25 pages, and/or other pertinent information, such as a description of support for similar systems and a statement of current capability to provide CSS and ISS supplies and services for the TSS to mitigate the reason why the Government should not procure this effort on a sole source basis as stated above, and/or identify other Government contracts with similar efforts for the Government(s) consideration.</p>

SCOPE OF WORK AND GENERAL SPECIFICATIONS
latitude System

1.	Background:


LATITUDE Consult System provides access to expert technical review of a BSC implanted device system  in locations such as the ER, Radiology, pre- or post-op, or at satellite locations without  immediate access to a  Boston Scientific  programmer or  representative.

The LATITUDE Consult system provides clinicians a convenient and secure way to review data from a Boston Scientific implanted device. Virtual technical support is available 24/7 when you call 1-800- CARDIAC. You'll be able to discuss the reviewed implanted device data live with a trained US-based LATITUDE Consult Technical Services Consultant. Optional reports are available via fax or emailed link and include a transmission report and reports similar to the standard programmer or LATITUDE reports.

The system is designed to be easy to use by any clinician who is at the patient's bedside in a health care facility. Easy touch-screen graphics provide step-by-step instructions.

The system allows clinicians to receive technical review and documentation of the implanted device
data for use in the patient's clinical evaluation without the need to wait for a company representative or company programmer. In this way, the LATITUDE Consult System is designed to improve turn-around time and increase patient satisfaction.

The workflow for the LATITUDE Consult system starts when a patient arrives who needs to have device data retrieved and viewed. The LATITUDE Consult communicator is used to read the patient's implanted device via a telemetry wand placed over the patient's device . Once the device's data has been read, the clinician uses the Communicator to send the data to the secure LATITUDE Consult server.

The clinician then contacts Boston Scientific LATITUDE Consult Technical Services to request a review of the data and obtain reports.  The clinician will need to be prepared to provide:  your name, patient name, model/serial number of implanted device, location calling from and phone number for return call. A LATITUDE Consult Technical Service Consultant could call back to discuss the data with the clinician.

This system can only read data from a supported Boston Scientific implanted device and cannot reprogram, command leads, or change any functions of the implanted device.

<DESC>Intent to Sole Source:
Under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 3304(a) (1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements; therefore the Department of Veterans Affairs, Great Lakes Acquisition Center, intends to award a sole source contract to Siemens Industry, Inc., 1000 Deerfield Parkway Buffalo Grove, IL 60089. Jesse Brown VA Medical Center currently has a Siemens fire alarm system installed in Building One (1) and wishes to extend the existing system into the new additions.  This is an extension to the existing building utility services. Siemens Industry, Inc. is the sole authorized servicing agent and only factory authorized holder of the proprietary hardware, software and program for the Siemens Industry, MXL Fire Alarm Systems installed at Jesse Brown VA Medical Center. This proprietary software and program is required to modernize the existing MXL Fire Alarm System to the XLS Fire Alarm System. This modernization will allow Jesse Brown to upgrade their existing system to Siemens new system, without the cost of a full system replacement. Due to the proprietary nature of addressable fire alarm systems and the need to maintain UL listings and factory trained and certified technicians to meet requirements by the VA and Joint Commission; other fire alarm providers would be required to replace the entire system. This modernization equates to approximately twenty-five percent (25%) of the cost of replacing the entire system with a new system. Additionally Siemens is required to ensure proper interface with the existing system, avoid warranty related issues, and ensure patient safety and security.  The use of Siemens fire alarm system is essential to the Government's requirements, thereby precluding consideration of a product manufactured by another company.
NOTE: This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. If any company has information that refutes the government's intent, please submit concerns to the Contract Specialist at gregory.franklin2@va.gov by May 28, 2016.

<p>FAR 52.212-2 "Evaluation--Commercial Items - (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:" 1. Technical. Capability of the item offered to meet the Government requirements as stated in the purchase description; and 2. Price. Award will be based on technical acceptability (acceptable or not acceptable) and then lowest total evaluated price. Technical acceptability will be determined solely on the content and merit of the information submitted in response to this request for quotation. Technical Tradeoffs will not be made and no additional credit will be given for exceeding acceptability. All offeror's shall provide with their proposal: descriptive literature, brochures, and a technical proposal response. Offerors must submit sufficient technical literature, documentation, etc., in order for the Government to make an adequate technical assessment of the proposed unit.

<p>The total evaluated price will be calculated as follows:</p>
<p>(1) On the basic year, the evaluated price will be the unit price proposed multiplied by the specified unit quantity (e.g. 2 EACH).</p>
<p>(2) For the option years, the evaluated price will be the unit price proposed multiplied by the maximum quantity available on the Option CLIN. Offeror's are advised that the evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise such options.</p>
<p>(3) The sum of all CLINs (Basic Year and Options) will represent the total evaluated price.</p>

DFARS Clause 252.204-7000: Disclosure of Information (August 2013) <BR> <BR>FedBid is NOT a forum for filing protests against the Government. Attempts to file protests through FedBid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). It is preferable that protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest level possible before considering the more formal process described below. To be timely, protests shall be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. 1) All agency-level protests should be sent to the Contracting Officer for resolution. 2) The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum. The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road RM: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil 
No protest under FAR Subpart 33.1 is authorized in connection with the issuance or proposed issuance of an order under a task-order contract or delivery-order contract, except for:
(1) A protest on the grounds that the order increases the scope, period, or maximum value of the contract; or (2) A protest of an order valued in excess of $10M. Protests of orders in excess of $10M may only be filed with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in accordance with the procedures at 33.104.
The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a)(10)(i)(B) of this section expires on September 30, 2016, for agencies other than DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard (41 U.S.C. 4103(d) and 41 U.S.C. 4106(f)). The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a) (10)(i)(B) of this section does not expire for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard.
AFARS 5116.5(b) (c) Each HCA shall designate a task and delivery order ombudsman for the contracting activity. The ombudsman shall be a senior official, who is independent of the Contracting Officer and may be the Special Competition Advocate. The ombudsman shall be responsible for reviewing complaints from the contractors under multiple award task or delivery order contracts and ensuring that all the contractors are afforded a fair opportunity to be considered, consistent with the procedures in the contract.
Summarize: the ombudsman will only determine if the government gave fair opportunity to a vendor who files a complaint. [AFARS Revision #25, Item XIII, dated April 1, 2010] <BR> <BR>IAW 52.212-1(g Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids) The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror?s initial offer should contain the offeror?s best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. <BR> <BR>Under FAR Part 12 Streamlined Procedures for Commercial Acquisitions, a debrief is not required. The Government will not offer a debrief for this requirement. <BR> <BR>Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is ?late? and may not be considered IAW with 52.212-1(f). At any time during and/or closing of the solicitation, all clarifications, discussions, or changes (as applicable) will be conducted ONLY by the Contracting Officer, MICC Fort Riley, Kansas. Any correspondence (electronic or verbal) presented to the vendor marketplace during the solicitation period by the FEDBID Staff, to include Quality Assurance, will be rejected by the Contracting Officer. No FEBBID correspondence will be accepted by MICC Fort Riley without prior coordination and approval from the Contracting Officer. <BR> <BR>New Equipment ONLY; NO remanufactured or "gray market" items. All items must be covered by the manufacturer's warranty. <BR> <BR>

Second option (option 2) includes, installation of coffer dams and 2,170 ft of gravity fed pipes. Next, the contractor must install upland dewatering basins in the locations shown on the plan sheets provided. Finally, a second river diversion/bypass approximately 3,055 ft in length must be put in place before the first diversion is removed. The second diversion would be smaller in size, needing to accommodate stream flows of 15 cfs (with an additional 5 cfs capacity to accommodate a potential storm event).</p>
<p>In addition, we are asking the contractor to provide us (USFS Staff) with the equipment necessary to operate a discharge water spray field in the dewatering basins.</p>
<p>Contractor Responsibility: The Contractor shall provide all equipment, supplies, transportation, labor, and supervision--necessary to complete the project, except for that which the contract clearly states is to be furnished by the Government.</p>

<p>C.8 Technical Requirements <br />1) The entire flow of the Upper Truckee River (UTR) must bypass the Project site by way of two separate diversions. The Contractor will install temporary dams on the UTR sufficient to capture all stream flow as well as two back to back downstream dams at the bottom of the project to control backwater. <br />&bull; By July 11th, stream flow is expected to be 30 cfs or less for the 1st diversion (D-1), pumps and piping will be used (option 1). Under the option 1 scenario, an additional 10 cfs capacity will be required to accommodate a potential storm event. If flows are higher than expected, at the LTBMU's discretion the contractor would install the temporary dams and piping, and the LTBMU would initiate a gravity diversion option rather than pumping (option 2). D-1 will be put in place starting the week of July11, 2016 and stay in place for 5-7 weeks.<br />&bull; The 2nd diversion (D-2) will be installed late enough in the season that flows are expected to be 15 cfs, this diversion will be pumped and piped. An additional 5 cfs capacity will be required for this diversion to accommodate a potential storm event. D-2 will be installed approximately Aug 22, 2016, and stay in place for 4-6 weeks.<br />&bull; Both water diversions must operate 24 hours a day until end of contract terms (or an earlier date specified by the LTBMU). <br />&bull; Contractor will be responsible for installation of all instream flow dissipaters at the outlet of each diversion. Contractor shall provide specifications for flow dissipaters for LTBMU approval.</p>
<p>2) Sound attenuation is required on all pumps and motors used on the project site.</p>
<p>3) Scheduled setup and removal of all equipment and supplies will be limited to Monday through Friday from 7am to 6pm.</p>
<p>4) Security fencing/personnel will be required around all vulnerable pumps and equipment to insure dewatering/diversion is not interrupted and resources are protected.<br />&bull; Contractor shall provide a contingency plan in the event of system failure.</p>
<p>5) Contractor will be allowed two weeks starting no earlier than 07/11/2016 to install and activate the first diversion system.<br />&bull; Access for installing the first diversion will be provided through/across the Lake Tahoe airport runway (which will require a designated vehicle escort) and along a temporary access road constructed by the LTBMU on the meadow surface. <br />o The number of trips into the site across the airport runway shall be minimized to the extent feasible.<br />&bull; Timing of 1st Diversion (D-1) installation will depend on river flows, anticipated to be approximately July 11th. <br />&bull; The 1st diversion (D-1) will need to be left in place until after the 2nd diversion (D-2) is installed.</p>
<p>6) Exact timing of the 2nd diversion installation is currently unknown, however the contractor will be provided 2 week notice prior to activating the diversion to establish the dam and divert full UTR flows.</p>
<p>7) For both diversions:<br />&bull; The diversion dam installations and removal shall follow the guidance provided in the design plans and the technical specifications.<br />&bull; The LTBMU will pump and discharge water encountered within the dewatered reach of the river while the diversion is in place (i.e. groundwater seepage).<br />&bull; The LTBMU will conduct aquatic organism salvage and removal in the existing channel during each diversion installation, which must be completed prior to full diversion activation.<br />o Metered flows into the channel downstream of the coffer dam would be required to maintain some flow for aquatic organism salvage, and to conduct channel flushing. For the pumped diversion(s), a wye fitting shall be installed near the upstream end of the diversion pipes. <br />o During this time, the diversion system will be required to be tested for leaks before full channel diversion.<br />o Contractor will need to coordinate closely with the LTBMU during aquatic organism salvage and relocation efforts, and possibly will need to delay the full river diversion to enable the crew to get the remaining organisms out of the river prior to diverting the entire river flow.<br />&bull; For protection of aquatic organisms and to prevent the spread of aquatic invasive species and pathogens:<br />o All equipment and vehicles used in a waterbody during project implementation shall be inspected and free of invasive species prior to implementation.<br />o Use screening devices for water drafting pumps to avoid impacts to aquatic species.<br />o Ensure that field gear (waders, float tubes, etc.) is cleaned, decontaminated, and/or fully dried prior to entering or moving between aquatic habitats.<br />o To minimize the risk of spreading potential aquatic pathogens and/or diseases through aquatic systems, all field gear (footwear, nets, etc.) that comes in contact with water shall be disinfected using a 0.016% solution of quaternary ammonia.</p>
<p>8) Contractor will be responsible for construction/installation and demobilizing of the Upland Dewater Basin (per sheet C-5 of the engineering plans and technical specifications). Upland Dewater Basin North (3.4 acres) and Dewater Irrigation Cell 6 (1.8 acres) will be required. Upland Dewater Basin North and Dewater Irrigation Cell 6 will be constructed immediately after installation of the first diversion (D-1) and completion of access road construction. Impermeable barrier fence (or approved equivalent) will be installed at the downslope perimeter of each of the Dewatering areas.</p>
<p>9) The contractor will be responsible for removal of both diversions and coffer dams at the completion of project activities in each respective area. Timing of removal of each diversion will depend on project progress. The contractor will be provided 1 week notice prior to needing each diversion demobilized.</p>
<p>10) The contractor will provide all the equipment necessary for our staff to assemble and operate a spray field in the dewatering basins. Items needed would include two 25yd filter boxes (which we could attach our 6" pump to), 300' of 6" alum pipe, 6" manifolds, six sprinklers on tripods (50-75gpm each), and 1500' of hose to supply the sprinklers.</p>
<p>11) Quotes should include make and model numbers for all mechanical equipment proposed for use to accommodate the flow capacities described above for each diversion.</p>

Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <br />(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. <br />(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. <br />(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. <br />(v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractor's representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract.</p>

By submission of its offer, the Offeror accepts all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements. All technically acceptable offerors, with acceptable past performance, shall be treated equally except for their prices. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale.</p>
<p>In order for an Offeror to be considered for award, the proposal must receive an "Acceptable" rating in every non-price factor. Any proposal receiving a rating of "Unacceptable" in any non-price factor will not be further evaluated.</p>
<p>The Government intends to evaluate proposals and make award without discussions. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines discussions to be necessary.</p>
<p>The Government intends to award one (1) contract for this requirement.</p>
<p>For the purpose of award, the Government shall evaluate offers based on the evaluation factors described below:</p>
<p>FACTOR 1 - Technical Acceptability</p>
<p>FACTOR 2 - Past Performance</p>
<p>FACTOR 3 - Price</p>
<p>Factor 1: Technical Acceptability:</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the contractor's technical specification and product literature to ensure that it reflects a sound understanding of this requirement.</p>
<p>Technical Acceptability/Unacceptable Ratings: <br />Acceptable - Proposal clearly meets the minimum requirements of the solicitation.<br />Unacceptable - Proposal does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the solicitation.</p>
<p>Factor 2: Past Performance:</p>
<p>Offeror to provide at least three (3) contract(s) that are relevant for the products listed in the price schedule and recent contract(s) for the last three years and present contract(s) in process that are relevant in nature to the solicitation. The Government may seek relevant and recent performance information on all responsive and otherwise Technically Acceptable Offerors through sources such as CPARS or PPIRS or other databases, interviews with Program Managers, Contracting Officers and other sources that are available. The government shall not be limited in its search for performance data. The offeror shall provide performance information for this factor. When performance is evaluated, the outcome is either Acceptable or Unacceptable. Unacceptable performance will disqualify an offeror from award.</p>
<p>Past Performance Include the following information for each contract or subcontract:</p>
<p>1. Name of Contracting Organization<br />2. Contract Number (for subcontracts, provide the prime contract number and the subcontract number)<br />3. Relevant: Total Contract Value <br />4. Relevant: Description of Supplies Requirement<br />5. Recency: Contract Performance Dates<br />6. Contracting Officer's Name and Telephone Number<br />7. Program Manager's and Telephone Number<br />8. North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code</p>
<p>Past Performance Evaluation Ratings:<br />Acceptable - Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown. <br />Unacceptable - Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (see FAR 15.305 (a)(2)(iv)). Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to have unknown past performance. In the context of acceptability/unacceptability, "unknown" shall be considered "acceptable."</p>
<p>Factor 3: Price:</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate the quote to determine the price fair and reasonable in accordance with FAR 13.106-3(a).</p>
<p>Offer must be good for 30 calendar day after submission.</p>
<p>FOB Destination CONUS (Continental U.S.). Shipping charges shall be included in the purchase cost of the product. Sellers shall deliver the products on the own conveyance to the location listed on the award.</p>
<p><br />In order to be considered for an award, an offeror must have completed the online electronic Representations and Certifications located at https://www.sam.gov/ in accordance with FAR 4.1201(a). By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in SAM at https://www.sam.gov/ prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation [Note: Lack of registration in the System for Award Management will make an offeror ineligible for award.] All responsible sources may submit an offer that will be considered by the Agency.</p>
<p>Offers must be submitted no later than 3:30 P.M., Mountain Standard Time May 30, 2016.</p>
<p>E-mail submissions only to Donovan.Conley@ihs.gov by required response time. Fax submissions are not authorized.</p>

<p>Addenda to FAR 52.212-4 are as follows:</p>
<p>1852.215-84 OMBUDSMAN. (NOV 2011)<br />(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and contractors during the preaward and postaward phases of this<br />acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source<br />of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the contracting officer, the Source Evaluation Board, or the selection official. Further, the<br />ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or<br />the adjudication of formal contract disputes. Therefore, before consulting with an ombudsman,<br />interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or<br />recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.</p>
<p>(b) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, interested parties may contact the<br />installation ombudsman, whose name, address, telephone number, facsimile number, and email<br />address may be found at: http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html. Concerns,<br />issues, disagreements, and recommendations which cannot be resolved at the installation may<br />be referred to the Agency ombudsman identified at the above URL. Please do not contact the<br />ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical<br />requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer or as specified<br />elsewhere in this document.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>2.3 1852.223-72 SAFETY AND HEALTH (SHORT FORM). (JUL 2015)<br />(a) Safety is the freedom from those conditions that can cause death, injury, occupational<br />illness; damage to or loss of equipment or property, or damage to the environment. NASA is<br />committed to protecting the safety and health of the public, our team members, and those<br />assets that the Nation entrusts to the Agency.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall have a documented, comprehensive and effective health and safety<br />program with a proactive process to identify, assess, and control hazards and take all<br />reasonable safety and occupational health measures consistent with standard industry practice<br />in performing this contract.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor shall insert the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (c) in subcontracts that exceed the simplified acquisition threshold where work will be conducted completely or partly on Federally-controlled facilities.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>2.4 1852.225-70 EXPORT LICENSES. (FEB 2000)<br />(a) The Contractor shall comply with all U.S. export control laws and regulations, including the<br />International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120 through 130, and the Export<br />Administration Regulations (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730 through 799, in the performance of this contract. In the absence of available license exemptions/exceptions, the Contractor shall be responsible for obtaining the appropriate licenses or other approvals, if required, for exports of hardware, technical data, and software, or for the provision of technical assistance.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall be responsible for obtaining export licenses, if required, before utilizing foreign persons in the performance of this contract, including instances where the work is to be performed on-site at NASA Langley Research Center, where the foreign person will have access to export-controlled technical data or software.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor shall be responsible for all regulatory record keeping requirements associated with the use of licenses and license exemptions/exceptions.</p>
<p>(d) The Contractor shall be responsible for ensuring that the provisions of this clause apply to its subcontractors.</p>
<p>(End of clause)</p>
<p>2.5 1852.237-73 RELEASE OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION. (JUN 2005)<br />(a) As used in this clause, "sensitive information" refers to information, not currently in the public domain, that the Contractor has developed at private expense, that may embody trade secrets or commercial or financial information, and that may be sensitive or privileged.</p>
<p>(b) In accomplishing management activities and administrative functions, NASA relies heavily on the support of various service providers. To support NASA activities and functions, these service providers, as well as their subcontractors and their individual employees, may need access to sensitive information submitted by the Contractor under this contract. By submitting this proposal or performing this contract, the Contractor agrees that NASA may release to its service providers, their subcontractors, and their individual employees, sensitive information submitted during the course of this procurement, subject to the enumerated protections mandated by the clause at 1852.237-72, Access to Sensitive Information.</p>
<p>(c)(1) The Contractor shall identify any sensitive information submitted in support of this proposal or in performing this contract. For purposes of identifying sensitive information, the<br />Contractor may, in addition to any other notice or legend otherwise required, use a notice similar to the following:</p>
<p>Mark the title page with the following legend:</p>
<p>This proposal or document includes sensitive information that NASA shall not disclose outside the Agency and its service providers that support management activities and administrative functions. To gain access to this sensitive information, a service provider's contract must contain the clause at NFS 1852.237-72, Access to Sensitive Information. Consistent with this clause,<br />the service provider shall not duplicate, use, or disclose the information in whole or in part for any purpose other than to perform the services specified in its contract. This restriction does not limit the Government's right to use this information if it is obtained from another source without restriction. The information subject to this restriction is contained in pages (insert page numbers or other identification of pages).</p>
<p>Mark each page of sensitive information the Contractor wishes to restrict with the following<br />legend:</p>
<p>Use or disclosure of sensitive information contained on this page is subject to the restriction on<br />the title page of this proposal or document.</p>
<p>(2) The Contracting Officer shall evaluate the facts supporting any claim that particular<br />information is "sensitive." This evaluation shall consider the time and resources necessary to<br />protect the information in accordance with the detailed safeguards mandated by the clause at<br />1852.237-72, Access to Sensitive Information. However, unless the Contracting Officer decides,<br />with the advice of Center counsel, that reasonable grounds exist to challenge the Contractor's<br />claim that particular information is sensitive, NASA and its service providers and their<br />employees shall comply with all of the safeguards contained in paragraph (d) of this clause.</p>
<p>(d) To receive access to sensitive information needed to assist NASA in accomplishing<br />management activities and administrative functions, the service provider must be operating<br />under a contract that contains the clause at 1852.237-72, Access to Sensitive Information. This<br />clause obligates the service provider to do the following:</p>
<p>(1) Comply with all specified procedures and obligations, including the Organizational Conflicts<br />of Interest Avoidance Plan, which the contract has incorporated as a compliance document.</p>
<p>(2) Utilize any sensitive information coming into its possession only for the purpose of<br />performing the services specified in its contract.</p>
<p>(3) Safeguard sensitive information coming into its possession from unauthorized use and<br />disclosure.</p>
<p>(4) Allow access to sensitive information only to those employees that need it to perform<br />services under its contract.</p>
<p>(5) Preclude access and disclosure of sensitive information to persons and entities outside of<br />the service provider's organization.</p>
<p>(6) Train employees who may require access to sensitive information about their obligations to<br />utilize it only to perform the services specified in its contract and to safeguard it from<br />unauthorized use and disclosure.</p>
<p>(7) Obtain a written affirmation from each employee that he/she has received and will comply<br />with training on the authorized uses and mandatory protections of sensitive information needed<br />in performing this contract.</p>
<p>(8) Administer a monitoring process to ensure that employees comply with all reasonable<br />security procedures, report any breaches to the Contracting Officer, and implement any<br />necessary corrective actions.</p>
<p>(e) When the service provider will have primary responsibility for operating an information<br />technology system for NASA that contains sensitive information, the service provider's contract<br />shall include the clause at 1852.204-76, Security Requirements for Unclassified Information<br />Technology Resources. The Security Requirements clause requires the service provider to<br />implement an Information Technology Security Plan to protect information processed, stored, or<br />transmitted from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or use.

<p>Addenda to FAR 52.212-4 are as follows:</p>
<p>1852.215-84 OMBUDSMAN. (NOV 2011)<br />(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and contractors during the preaward and postaward phases of this<br />acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source<br />of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the contracting officer, the Source Evaluation Board, or the selection official. Further, the<br />ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or<br />the adjudication of formal contract disputes. Therefore, before consulting with an ombudsman,<br />interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or<br />recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.</p>
<p>(b) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, interested parties may contact the<br />installation ombudsman, whose name, address, telephone number, facsimile number, and email<br />address may be found at: http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html. Concerns,<br />issues, disagreements, and recommendations which cannot be resolved at the installation may<br />be referred to the Agency ombudsman identified at the above URL. Please do not contact the<br />ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical<br />requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer or as specified<br />elsewhere in this document.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>2.3 1852.223-72 SAFETY AND HEALTH (SHORT FORM). (JUL 2015)<br />(a) Safety is the freedom from those conditions that can cause death, injury, occupational<br />illness; damage to or loss of equipment or property, or damage to the environment. NASA is<br />committed to protecting the safety and health of the public, our team members, and those<br />assets that the Nation entrusts to the Agency.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall have a documented, comprehensive and effective health and safety<br />program with a proactive process to identify, assess, and control hazards and take all<br />reasonable safety and occupational health measures consistent with standard industry practice<br />in performing this contract.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor shall insert the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (c) in subcontracts that exceed the simplified acquisition threshold where work will be conducted completely or partly on Federally-controlled facilities.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>2.4 1852.225-70 EXPORT LICENSES. (FEB 2000)<br />(a) The Contractor shall comply with all U.S. export control laws and regulations, including the<br />International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), 22 CFR Parts 120 through 130, and the Export<br />Administration Regulations (EAR), 15 CFR Parts 730 through 799, in the performance of this contract. In the absence of available license exemptions/exceptions, the Contractor shall be responsible for obtaining the appropriate licenses or other approvals, if required, for exports of hardware, technical data, and software, or for the provision of technical assistance.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall be responsible for obtaining export licenses, if required, before utilizing foreign persons in the performance of this contract, including instances where the work is to be performed on-site at NASA Langley Research Center, where the foreign person will have access to export-controlled technical data or software.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor shall be responsible for all regulatory record keeping requirements associated with the use of licenses and license exemptions/exceptions.</p>
<p>(d) The Contractor shall be responsible for ensuring that the provisions of this clause apply to its subcontractors.</p>
<p>(End of clause)</p>
<p>2.5 1852.237-73 RELEASE OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION. (JUN 2005)<br />(a) As used in this clause, "sensitive information" refers to information, not currently in the public domain, that the Contractor has developed at private expense, that may embody trade secrets or commercial or financial information, and that may be sensitive or privileged.</p>
<p>(b) In accomplishing management activities and administrative functions, NASA relies heavily on the support of various service providers. To support NASA activities and functions, these service providers, as well as their subcontractors and their individual employees, may need access to sensitive information submitted by the Contractor under this contract. By submitting this proposal or performing this contract, the Contractor agrees that NASA may release to its service providers, their subcontractors, and their individual employees, sensitive information submitted during the course of this procurement, subject to the enumerated protections mandated by the clause at 1852.237-72, Access to Sensitive Information.</p>
<p>(c)(1) The Contractor shall identify any sensitive information submitted in support of this proposal or in performing this contract. For purposes of identifying sensitive information, the<br />Contractor may, in addition to any other notice or legend otherwise required, use a notice similar to the following:</p>
<p>Mark the title page with the following legend:</p>
<p>This proposal or document includes sensitive information that NASA shall not disclose outside the Agency and its service providers that support management activities and administrative functions. To gain access to this sensitive information, a service provider's contract must contain the clause at NFS 1852.237-72, Access to Sensitive Information. Consistent with this clause,<br />the service provider shall not duplicate, use, or disclose the information in whole or in part for any purpose other than to perform the services specified in its contract. This restriction does not limit the Government's right to use this information if it is obtained from another source without restriction. The information subject to this restriction is contained in pages (insert page numbers or other identification of pages).</p>
<p>Mark each page of sensitive information the Contractor wishes to restrict with the following<br />legend:</p>
<p>Use or disclosure of sensitive information contained on this page is subject to the restriction on<br />the title page of this proposal or document.</p>
<p>(2) The Contracting Officer shall evaluate the facts supporting any claim that particular<br />information is "sensitive." This evaluation shall consider the time and resources necessary to<br />protect the information in accordance with the detailed safeguards mandated by the clause at<br />1852.237-72, Access to Sensitive Information. However, unless the Contracting Officer decides,<br />with the advice of Center counsel, that reasonable grounds exist to challenge the Contractor's<br />claim that particular information is sensitive, NASA and its service providers and their<br />employees shall comply with all of the safeguards contained in paragraph (d) of this clause.</p>
<p>(d) To receive access to sensitive information needed to assist NASA in accomplishing<br />management activities and administrative functions, the service provider must be operating<br />under a contract that contains the clause at 1852.237-72, Access to Sensitive Information. This<br />clause obligates the service provider to do the following:</p>
<p>(1) Comply with all specified procedures and obligations, including the Organizational Conflicts<br />of Interest Avoidance Plan, which the contract has incorporated as a compliance document.</p>
<p>(2) Utilize any sensitive information coming into its possession only for the purpose of<br />performing the services specified in its contract.</p>
<p>(3) Safeguard sensitive information coming into its possession from unauthorized use and<br />disclosure.</p>
<p>(4) Allow access to sensitive information only to those employees that need it to perform<br />services under its contract.</p>
<p>(5) Preclude access and disclosure of sensitive information to persons and entities outside of<br />the service provider's organization.</p>
<p>(6) Train employees who may require access to sensitive information about their obligations to<br />utilize it only to perform the services specified in its contract and to safeguard it from<br />unauthorized use and disclosure.</p>
<p>(7) Obtain a written affirmation from each employee that he/she has received and will comply<br />with training on the authorized uses and mandatory protections of sensitive information needed<br />in performing this contract.</p>
<p>(8) Administer a monitoring process to ensure that employees comply with all reasonable<br />security procedures, report any breaches to the Contracting Officer, and implement any<br />necessary corrective actions.</p>
<p>(e) When the service provider will have primary responsibility for operating an information<br />technology system for NASA that contains sensitive information, the service provider's contract<br />shall include the clause at 1852.204-76, Security Requirements for Unclassified Information<br />Technology Resources. The Security Requirements clause requires the service provider to<br />implement an Information Technology Security Plan to protect information processed, stored, or<br />transmitted from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or use. Service provider personnel<br />requiring privileged access or limited privileged access to these information technology systems<br />are subject to screening using the standard National Agency Check (NAC) forms appropriate to<br />the level of risk for adverse impact to NASA missions. The Contracting Officer may allow the<br />service provider to conduct its own screening, provided the service provider employs<br />substantially equivalent screening procedures.</p>
<p>(f) This clause does not affect NASA's responsibilities under the Freedom of Information Act.</p>
<p>(g) The Contractor shall insert this clause, including this paragraph (g), suitably modified to<br />reflect the relationship of the parties, in all subcontracts that may require the furnishing of<br />sensitive information.</p>
<p>(End of clause)</p>

In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) (APR 2010) (a) ___________ is hereby designated as the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR).

For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage.

The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>(End of clause)</p>
<p>SAFEGUARDING OF SENSITIVE INFORMATION (MAR 2015)</p>
<p>(a) Applicability. This clause applies to the Contractor, its subcontractors, and Contractor employees (hereafter referred to collectively as "Contractor"). The Contractor shall insert the substance of this clause in all subcontracts.</p>
<p>(b) Definitions. As used in this clause-</p>
<p>"Personally Identifiable Information (PII)" means information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, such as name, social security number, or biometric records, either alone, or when combined with other personal or identifying information that is linked or linkable to a specific individual, such as date and place of birth, or mother's maiden name. The definition of PII is not anchored to any single category of information or technology. Rather, it requires a case-by-case assessment of the specific risk that an individual can be identified. In performing this assessment, it is important for an agency to recognize that non-personally identifiable information can become personally identifiable information whenever additional information is made publicly available-in any medium and from any source-that, combined with other available information, could be used to identify an individual.</p>
<p>PII is a subset of sensitive information. Examples of PII include, but are not limited to: name, date of birth, mailing address, telephone number, Social Security number (SSN), email address, zip code, account numbers, certificate/license numbers, vehicle identifiers including license plates, uniform resource locators (URLs), static Internet protocol addresses, biometric identifiers such as fingerprint, voiceprint, iris scan, photographic facial images, or any other unique identifying number or characteristic, and any information where it is reasonably foreseeable that the information will be linked with other information to identify the individual.</p>
<p>"Sensitive Information" is defined in HSAR clause 3052.204-71, Contractor Employee Access, as any information, which if lost, misused, disclosed, or, without authorization is accessed, or modified, could adversely affect the national or homeland security interest, the conduct of Federal programs, or the privacy to which individuals are entitled under section 552a of Title 5, United States Code (the Privacy Act), but which has not been specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive Order or an Act of Congress to be kept secret in the interest of national defense, homeland security or foreign policy. This definition includes the following categories of information:</p>
<p>(1) Protected Critical Infrastructure Information (PCII) as set out in the Critical Infrastructure Information Act of 2002 (Title II, Subtitle B, of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, 196 Stat. 2135), as amended, the implementing regulations thereto (Title 6, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 29) as amended, the applicable PCII Procedures Manual, as amended, and any supplementary guidance officially communicated by an authorized official of the Department of Homeland Security (including the PCII Program Manager or his/her designee);</p>
<p>(2) Sensitive Security Information (SSI), as defined in Title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 1520, as amended, "Policies and Procedures of Safeguarding and Control of SSI," as amended, and any supplementary guidance officially communicated by an authorized official of the Department of Homeland Security (including the Assistant Secretary for the Transportation Security Administration or his/her designee); <br /><br />(3) Information designated as "For Official Use Only," which is unclassified information of a sensitive nature and the unauthorized disclosure of which could adversely impact a person's privacy or welfare, the conduct of Federal programs, or other programs or operations essential to the national or homeland security interest; and</p>
<p>(4) Any information that is designated "sensitive" or subject to other controls, safeguards or protections in accordance with subsequently adopted homeland security information handling procedures.</p>
<p>"Sensitive Information Incident" is an incident that includes the known, potential, or suspected exposure, loss of control, compromise, unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized acquisition, or unauthorized access or attempted access of any Government system, Contractor system, or sensitive information.</p>
<p>"Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (SPII)" is a subset of PII, which if lost, compromised or disclosed without authorization, could result in substantial harm, embarrassment, inconvenience, or unfairness to an individual. Some forms of PII are sensitive as stand-alone elements. Examples of such PII include: Social Security numbers (SSN), driver's license or state identification number, Alien Registration Numbers (A-number), financial account number, and biometric identifiers such as fingerprint, voiceprint, or iris scan. Additional examples include any groupings of information that contain an individual's name or other unique identifier plus one or more of the following elements:</p>
<p>(1) Truncated SSN (such as last 4 digits)<br />(2) Date of birth (month, day, and year)<br />(3) Citizenship or immigration status<br />(4) Ethnic or religious affiliation<br />(5) Sexual orientation<br />(6) Criminal History<br />(7) Medical Information<br />(8) System authentication information such as mother's maiden name, account passwords or personal identification numbers (PIN)</p>
<p>Other PII may be "sensitive" depending on its context, such as a list of employees and their performance ratings or an unlisted home address or phone number. In contrast, a business card or public telephone directory of agency employees contains PII but is not sensitive.</p>
<p>(c) Authorities. The Contractor shall follow all current versions of Government policies and guidance accessible at http://www.dhs.gov/dhs-security-and-training-requirements-contractors, or available upon request from the Contracting Officer, including but not limited to:</p>
<p>(1) DHS Management Directive 11042.1 Safeguarding Sensitive But Unclassified (for Official Use Only) Information<br />(2) DHS Sensitive Systems Policy Directive 4300A<br />(3) DHS 4300A Sensitive Systems Handbook and Attachments<br />(4) DHS Security Authorization Process Guide<br />(5) DHS Handbook for Safeguarding Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information<br />(6) DHS Instruction Handbook 121-01-007 Department of Homeland Security Personnel Suitability and Security Program<br />(7) DHS Information Security Performance Plan (current fiscal year)<br />(8) DHS Privacy Incident Handling Guidance <br />(9) Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2 Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules accessible at http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/standards.html<br />(10) National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-53 Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations accessible at http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html<br />(11) NIST Special Publication 800-88 Guidelines for Media Sanitization accessible at http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html</p>
<p>(d) Handling of Sensitive Information. Contractor compliance with this clause, as well as the policies and procedures described below, is required.</p>
<p>(1) Department of Homeland Security (DHS) policies and procedures on Contractor personnel security requirements are set forth in various Management Directives (MDs), Directives, and Instructions. MD 11042.1, Safeguarding Sensitive But Unclassified (For Official Use Only) Information describes how Contractors must handle sensitive but unclassified information. DHS uses the term "FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY" to identify sensitive but unclassified information that is not otherwise categorized by statute or regulation. Examples of sensitive information that are categorized by statute or regulation are PCII, SSI, etc. The DHS Sensitive Systems Policy Directive 4300A and the DHS 4300A Sensitive Systems Handbook provide the policies and procedures on security for Information Technology (IT) resources. The DHS Handbook for Safeguarding Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information provides guidelines to help safeguard SPII in both paper and electronic form. DHS Instruction Handbook 121-01-007 Department of Homeland Security Personnel Suitability and Security Program establishes procedures, program responsibilities, minimum standards, and reporting protocols for the DHS Personnel Suitability and Security Program.</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor shall not use or redistribute any sensitive information processed, stored, and/or transmitted by the Contractor except as specified in the contract.</p>
<p>(3) All Contractor employees with access to sensitive information shall execute DHS Form 11000-6, Department of Homeland Security Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA), as a condition of access to such information. The Contractor shall maintain signed copies of the NDA for all employees as a record of compliance. The Contractor shall provide copies of the signed NDA to the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) no later than two (2) days after execution of the form.</p>
<p>(4) The Contractor's invoicing, billing, and other recordkeeping systems maintained to support financial or other administrative functions shall not maintain SPII. It is acceptable to maintain in these systems the names, titles and contact information for the COR or other Government personnel associated with the administration of the contract, as needed.</p>
<p>(e) Authority to Operate. The Contractor shall not input, store, process, output, and/or transmit sensitive information within a Contractor IT system without an Authority to Operate (ATO) signed by the Headquarters or Component CIO, or designee, in consultation with the Headquarters or Component Privacy Officer. Unless otherwise specified in the ATO letter, the ATO is valid for three (3) years. The Contractor shall adhere to current Government policies, procedures, and guidance for the Security Authorization (SA) process as defined below.</p>
<p>(1) Complete the Security Authorization process. The SA process shall proceed according to the DHS Sensitive Systems Policy Directive 4300A (Version 11.0, April 30, 2014), or any successor publication, DHS 4300A Sensitive Systems Handbook (Version 9.1, July 24, 2012), or any successor publication, and the Security Authorization Process Guide including templates.</p>
<p>(i) Security Authorization Process Documentation. SA documentation shall be developed using the Government provided Requirements Traceability Matrix and Government security documentation templates. SA documentation consists of the following: Security Plan, Contingency Plan, Contingency Plan Test Results, Configuration Management Plan, Security Assessment Plan, Security Assessment Report, and Authorization to Operate Letter. Additional documents that may be required include a Plan(s) of Action and Milestones and Interconnection Security Agreement(s). During the development of SA documentation, the Contractor shall submit a signed SA package, validated by an independent third party, to the COR for acceptance by the Headquarters or Component CIO, or designee, at least thirty (30) days prior to the date of operation of the IT system. The Government is the final authority on the compliance of the SA package and may limit the number of resubmissions of a modified SA package. Once the ATO has been accepted by the Headquarters or Component CIO, or designee, the Contracting Officer shall incorporate the ATO into the contract as a compliance document. The Government's acceptance of the ATO does not alleviate the Contractor's responsibility to ensure the IT system controls are implemented and operating effectively.</p>
<p>(ii) Independent Assessment. Contractors shall have an independent third party validate the security and privacy controls in place for the system(s). The independent third party shall review and analyze the SA package, and report on technical, operational, and management level deficiencies as outlined in NIST Special Publication 800-53 Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations. The Contractor shall address all deficiencies before submitting the SA package to the Government for acceptance.</p>
<p>(iii) Support the completion of the Privacy Threshold Analysis (PTA) as needed. As part of the SA process, the Contractor may be required to support the Government in the completion of the PTA. The requirement to complete a PTA is triggered by the creation, use, modification, upgrade, or disposition of a Contractor IT system that will store, maintain and use PII, and must be renewed at least every three (3) years. Upon review of the PTA, the DHS Privacy Office determines whether a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) and/or Privacy Act System of Records Notice (SORN), or modifications thereto, are required. The Contractor shall provide all support necessary to assist the Department in completing the PIA in a timely manner and shall ensure that project management plans and schedules include time for the completion of the PTA, PIA, and SORN (to the extent required) as milestones. Support in this context includes responding timely to requests for information from the Government about the use, access, storage, and maintenance of PII on the Contractor's system, and providing timely review of relevant compliance documents for factual accuracy. Information on the DHS privacy compliance process, including PTAs, PIAs, and SORNs, is accessible at http://www.dhs.gov/privacy-compliance.</p>
<p>(2) Renewal of ATO. Unless otherwise specified in the ATO letter, the ATO shall be renewed every three (3) years. The Contractor is required to update its SA package as part of the ATO renewal process. The Contractor shall update its SA package by one of the following methods: (1) Updating the SA documentation in the DHS automated information assurance tool for acceptance by the Headquarters or Component CIO, or designee, at least 90 days before the ATO expiration date for review and verification of security controls; or (2) Submitting an updated SA package directly to the COR for approval by the Headquarters or Component CIO, or designee, at least 90 days before the ATO expiration date for review and verification of security controls. The 90 day review process is independent of the system production date and therefore it is important that the Contractor build the review into project schedules. The reviews may include onsite visits that involve physical or logical inspection of the Contractor environment to ensure controls are in place.</p>
<p>(3) Security Review. The Government may elect to conduct random periodic reviews to ensure that the security requirements contained in this contract are being implemented and enforced. The Contractor shall afford DHS, the Office of the Inspector General, and other Government organizations access to the Contractor's facilities, installations, operations, documentation, databases and personnel used in the performance of this contract. The Contractor shall, through the Contracting Officer and COR, contact the Headquarters or Component CIO, or designee, to coordinate and participate in review and inspection activity by Government organizations external to the DHS. Access shall be provided, to the extent necessary as determined by the Government, for the Government to carry out a program of inspection, investigation, and audit to safeguard against threats and hazards to the integrity, availability and confidentiality of Government data or the function of computer systems used in performance of this contract and to preserve evidence of computer crime.</p>
<p>(4) Continuous Monitoring. All Contractor-operated systems that input, store, process, output, and/or transmit sensitive information shall meet or exceed the continuous monitoring requirements identified in the Fiscal Year 2014 DHS Information Security Performance Plan, or successor publication. The plan is updated on an annual basis. The Contractor shall also store monthly continuous monitoring data at its location for a period not less than one year from the date the data is created. The data shall be encrypted in accordance with FIPS 140-2 Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules and shall not be stored on systems that are shared with other commercial or Government entities. The Government may elect to perform continuous monitoring and IT security scanning of Contractor systems from Government tools and infrastructure.</p>
<p>(5) Revocation of ATO. In the event of a sensitive information incident, the Government may suspend or revoke an existing ATO (either in part or in whole). If an ATO is suspended or revoked in accordance with this provision, the Contracting Officer may direct the Contractor to take additional security measures to secure sensitive information. These measures may include restricting access to sensitive information on the Contractor IT system under this contract. Restricting access may include disconnecting the system processing, storing, or transmitting the sensitive information from the Internet or other networks or applying additional security controls.</p>
<p>(6) Federal Reporting Requirements. Contractors operating information systems on behalf of the Government or operating systems containing sensitive information shall comply with Federal reporting requirements. Annual and quarterly data collection will be coordinated by the Government. Contractors shall provide the COR with requested information within three (3) business days of receipt of the request. Reporting requirements are determined by the Government and are defined in the Fiscal Year 2014 DHS Information Security Performance Plan, or successor publication. The Contractor shall provide the Government with all information to fully satisfy Federal reporting requirements for Contractor systems.</p>
<p>(f) Sensitive Information Incident Reporting Requirements.</p>
<p>(1) All known or suspected sensitive information incidents shall be reported to the Headquarters or Component Security Operations Center (SOC) within one hour of discovery in accordance with 4300A Sensitive Systems Handbook Incident Response and Reporting requirements. When notifying the Headquarters or Component SOC, the Contractor shall also notify the Contracting Officer, COR, Headquarters or Component Privacy Officer, and US-CERT using the contact information identified in the contract. If the incident is reported by phone or the Contracting Officer's email address is not immediately available, the Contractor shall contact the Contracting Officer immediately after reporting the incident to the Headquarters or Component SOC. The Contractor shall not include any sensitive information in the subject or body of any e-mail. To transmit sensitive information, the Contractor shall use FIPS 140-2 Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules compliant encryption methods to protect sensitive information in attachments to email. Passwords shall not be communicated in the same email as the attachment. A sensitive information incident shall not, by itself, be interpreted as evidence that the Contractor has failed to provide adequate information security safeguards for sensitive information, or has otherwise failed to meet the requirements of the contract.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.<br />OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.<br />The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. <br />(1) Certain stock disregarded.

(Aug. 1996)<br />(a) Definition. "Supplies," as used in this clause, includes but is not limited to raw materials, components, intermediate assemblies, end products, and lots of supplies.<br />(b) The Contractor shall provide and maintain an inspection system acceptable to the Government covering supplies under this contract and shall tender to the Government for acceptance only supplies that have been inspected in accordance with the inspection system and have been found by the Contractor to be in conformity with contract requirements. As part of the system, the Contractor shall prepare records evidencing all inspections made under the system and the outcome. These records shall be kept complete and made available to the Government during contract performance and for as long afterwards as the contract requires. The Government may perform reviews and evaluations as reasonably necessary to ascertain compliance with this paragraph. These reviews and evaluations shall be conducted in a manner that will not unduly delay the contract work. The right of review, whether exercised or not, does not relieve the Contractor of the obligations under the contract.<br />(c) The Government has the right to inspect and test all supplies called for by the contract, to the extent practicable, at all places and times, including the period of manufacture, and in any event before acceptance. The Government shall perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Government assumes no contractual obligation to perform any inspection and test for the benefit of the Contractor unless specifically set forth elsewhere in this contract.<br />(d) If the Government performs inspection or test on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish, and shall require subcontractors to furnish, at no increase in contract price, all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. Except as otherwise provided in the contract, the Government shall bear the expense of Government inspections or tests made at other than the Contractor's or subcontractor's premises; provided, that in case of rejection, the Government shall not be liable for any reduction in the value of inspection or test samples.<br />(e)<br />(1) When supplies are not ready at the time specified by the Contractor for inspection or test, the Contracting Officer may charge to the Contractor the additional cost of inspection or test.<br />(2) The Contracting Officer may also charge the Contractor for any additional cost of inspection or test when prior rejection makes reinspection or retest necessary.<br />(f) The Government has the right either to reject or to require correction of nonconforming supplies. Supplies are nonconforming when they are defective in material or workmanship or are otherwise not in conformity with contract requirements. The Government may reject nonconforming supplies with or without disposition instructions.<br />(g) The Contractor shall remove supplies rejected or required to be corrected. However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice, by and at the expense of the Contractor. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and charge the cost to the Contractor or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and make an equitable price reduction. Failure to agree to a price reduction shall be a dispute.<br />(i)<br />(1) If this contract provides for the performance of Government quality assurance at source, and if requested by the Government, the Contractor shall furnish advance notification of the time --<br />(i) When Contractor inspection or tests will be performed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract; and<br />(ii) When the supplies will be ready for Government inspection.<br />(2) The Government's request shall specify the period and method of the advance notification and the Government representative to whom it shall be furnished. Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.<br />(j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.<br />(k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.<br />(l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor<br />(1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or<br />(2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.<br />(End of Clause)<br />Alternate I (Jul 1985).

The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken. Cost of removal, replacement, or correction shall be considered a cost incurred, or to be incurred, in the total final negotiated cost fixed under the incentive price revision clause. However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the total final price shall be at no increase in the total final price.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the target price or, if established, the total final price or<br />(2) may terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce any target price or, if it is established, the total final contract price.

However, the Contracting Officer may require or permit correction in place, promptly after notice. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance corrected or rejected supplies without disclosing the former rejection or requirement for correction, and when required shall disclose the corrective action taken. Cost of removal, replacement, or correction shall be considered a cost incurred, or to be incurred, when redetermining the prices under the price redetermination clause. However, replacements or corrections by the Contractor after the establishment of the redetermined prices shall be at no increase in the redetermined price.<br />(h) If the Contractor fails to promptly remove, replace, or correct rejected supplies that are required to be removed or to be replaced or corrected, the Government may either<br />(1) by contract or otherwise, remove, replace, or correct the supplies and equitably reduce the initial contract prices or, if established, the redetermined contract prices or<br />(2) terminate the contract for default.<br />Unless the Contractor corrects or replaces the nonconforming supplies within the delivery schedule, the Contracting Officer may require their delivery and equitably reduce the initial contract price or, if it is established, the redetermined contract prices.

(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<a href="mailto:lauren.lauver@navy.mil">lauren.lauver@navy.mil</a>
<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis to determine the availability of potential sources capable of providing fully integrated replacement shelters for the Relocatable Over-The-Horizon Radar (ROTHR) transmit site arrays, the transmit site monitor (TSM) and the receive site monitor (RSM).  The ROTHR System is a very unique radar system that uses high-frequency (HF) over-the-horizon (OTH) radar to track and detect drug trafficking activities in Northern South American and Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico basins. ROTHR is based on an extremely complex technology that uses the Earths ionosphere to reflect/refract radar signals over extraordinary distances. The electronic shelters are an integral part of the operation of the ROTHR system. The shelters provide electrical, electro-magnetic, and environmental shielding of the electronics. Within the shelter there are physical limitations, i.e. ridged cables, air conditioner tuning, physical footprint, etc. that restricts changes  to the current configuration.  The requirement is for fully integrated shelters meaning the contractor will be required to manufacture replacement shelters and install the ROTHR system to operational levels. Unique ROTHR installation and integration effort to enable form fit and function shelters requires integral involvement of the shelter manufacturing effort with technical knowledge and experience of the ROTHR RADAR electronic equipment which is necessary due to unique site specific parameters indicative of a one of a kind, limited production system like ROTHR.   Each ROTHR system contains a transmit and receive site.  All three ROTHR transmit sites are composed of eleven transmit shelters and one Transmit Site Monitor Shelter Complex.  The transmit shelters are designed to be re-locatable to a prepared site and house transmitters and associated control and switching circuits that provide power amplification of the low power Radio Frequency transmit signals generated in the Transmit Site Monitor Shelter complex.  There is also one environmental transmit sounder shelter which supports characterization of the ionosphere during radar operations which is a slightly modified transmit shelter.  Lastly, there is a Transmit Site Monitor Shelter complex consisting of three joined shelters which contains equipment for providing excitation for the radar transmitters equipment for communications back to the ROTHR Operations Control Center (OCC) as well as fire monitoring, suppression, and report system in each transmit site shelters. At each Receive site there is one Receive Site Monitor (RSM) which consists of four joined electronic shelters which contain monitoring and communication electronics for the receive site and sends communication to the OCC as well as fire monitoring, suppression, and report system in all receive site shelters. These shelters are located at the three ROTHR sites in Texas, Virginia, and Puerto Rico.   The contractor would have to be capable of successfully fabricating an equipment shelter and integrating ROTHR electronics into an operational configuration while effectively minimizing system downtime and maximizing operational availability required by combatant commands. This requirement presents several challenges to the Contractor including having to integrate a mature radar system where the Level III drawings are not available. The drawings are proprietary to the original ROTHR manufacturer and as such the Government does not have access to all of the drawings, specifications and detailed electronics equipment configurations. There are currently no technical manuals which the Government can provide which can assist in the integration effort. In addition to not having all of the radar drawings, the Government also does not have all of the drawings/specifications for the shelters. Furthermore, the Government recently learned that the shelter specifications that Government does have access to, may be inaccurate as subsequent undocumented modifications were made in the original production and integration effort.    Raytheon, as the sole developer, producer, design agent, and possessor of the Level III drawings of the ROTHR systems, is the only known company with the highly specialized knowledge and technical data to provide the required shelter manufacturing and integrating services.  The anticipated ordering period for this Cost Plus Fixed Fee Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity procurement is 15 April 2017 to 14 April 2021. Individual task orders will be issued under the contract awarded. The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) code is 332311. Interested offerors possessing the requisite experience, skills, resources, and capabilities necessary to perform the stated requirement are invited to respond to this market research survey/source sought synopsis by providing their capability information via the submission of an executive summary, no more than three (3) pages in length. The submission shall include the following information: (1) company name, address, point of contact with corresponding phone number and email address; and business size; (2) relevant corporate experience information. Relevant corporate experience information is defined as experience that is of the same or similar scope, magnitude, and complexity to that which is described herein. This relevant corporate experience information should identify a customer point of contact with corresponding telephone number and email address and (3) address how your firm is capable of overcoming the challenges discussed above (manufacturing a shelter without detailed/accurate specifications and integrating that shelter with a unique radar system without technical manuals). All submissions are required to be submitted via email to lauren.lauver@navy.mil no later than 1:00pm (local time/Philadelphia, PA) on 18 May 2016. Please direct any questions concerning this sources sought synopsis to Lauren Lauver at lauren.lauver@navy.mil.

<DESC><p>The purpose of this Amendment to Sources Sought Notice Number OPM3516S0001 is to provide an answer to a question we received regarding this Sources Sought Notice. The question and answer are as follows:</p>
<p>Question: My group had a question regarding the BENEFEDS Enrollment and Premium Administration Services Sources Sought Notice. A few different numbers are mentioned and we need to clarify. Are the numbers just employees or is it employees plus dependents? We are trying to figure the total group size and the mention of 2 million was not 100% clear to our analyst, as mentioned in the notice. Could you please advise?</p>
<p>Answer: As stated on Page 2 of the Sources Sought Notice, two million refers to Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program (FEDVIP) enrollments. As indicated on Page 9, Number 8 of the Sources Sought Notice, the successful offeror would support over two million customers.</p>

Additionally, the SE&amp;I contractor ensures that the STAO documentation is updated to ensure training requirements are current.</span>

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR SINGLE SOURCE AWARDS IAW FAR 13.106-1
(OVER MICRO-PURCHASE THRESHOLD($3K) BUT NOT EXCEEDING THE SAT ($150K))
IAW FAR13.104, COs must promote competition to the maximum extent practicable to obtain supplies and services from the source whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government, considering the administrative cost of the purchase. When competition is not practicable, IAW FAR13.106-1(b), COs solicit from a single source for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.  COs may solicit from one source if the CO determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization). IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3),COs are required to include additional statements explaining the absence of competition (see 13.106-1 for brand name purchases) if only one source is solicited and the acquisition does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (does not apply to an acquisition of utility services available from only one source) or supporting the award decision if other than price-related factors were considered in selecting the supplier.  This template when completed can be used to document single source awards IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3).  Note: Statements such as "only known source" or "only source which can meet the required delivery date" are inadequate to support a sole source purchase.  
1. PURCHASE REQUEST OR REQUISITION NUMBER:
Emprint Procedure Planning Application	1A. PROJECT/TASK NUMBER
541-36A-16-00012	1B. ESTIMATED AMOUNT: 

$34,990

2. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED AND THE INTENDED USE: This activity proposes to solicit with Covidien Sales LLC a large business using sole source procurement procedures under NAICS Code 339112 for The Emprint Procedure Planning Application allows clinicians to use pre-procedural and intra-procedural patient CT image data to visualize and create a plan for lung or liver ablation procedures, as well as the ability to compare follow-up imaging.


3. UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED: The Louis Stokes Cleveland Department of Veterans Affairs Healthcare System is requesting VISN 10 Contracting Activity to enter into sole source procurement with Covidien Sales LLC to complete the above stated services. The Cleveland VAMC recently (Oct 2015) purchased the Emprint Ablation system. This software will allows us to optimize the usage of the equipment. The Emprintâ„¢ Planning application is designed for use with the Emprintâ„¢ Ablation system with Thermosphereâ„¢ technology. This request is being entered as a sole source does to the proprietary nature of the equipment, and the urgency of the request in relation to safety and quality patient care. All repairs are to be completed with the use of OEM parts, tools materials, methods, and software.

4.  REASON THAT SUGGESTED SOURCE IS THE ONLY SOURCE, WHICH CAN PROVIDE THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES:  
None- Proprietary parts, tools, materials, and software as applicable-OEM Certified field service engineer. All maintenance inspections and repairs must be done with OEM parts, tools, materials, and software to meet specific capabilities and specifications of the above stated equipment. Third party vendors do not have access to OEM parts. Therefore other companies were not contacted for this proposed purchase order. According to our subject matter experts, this is the only company that has the latest technology available. The ablation machine and software is patented technology that will allows us to perform lung ablation's, decrease our current local recurrence rate and improve ablations zones which will optimize patient treatment and successful rate with only one treatment session.  The new Emprintâ„¢ Platform has Thermosphereâ„¢ Technology, Thermosphereâ„¢ Technology is the only actively buffered energy platform on the market and this is a novel and highly patented design. 



5. DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND RESULTS OR STATEMENT WHY IT WAS NOT CONDUCTED: FAR 6.302-2 does not require competition based on the agency's need for The Emprint Procedure Planning Application. Market research was conducted using the FSS Schedule, a search by our subject matter experts and an online search engine search. The resulting findings were that the Covidien Procedure Planning Application will best meet the needs of the organization. The new Emprintâ„¢ Platform has Thermosphereâ„¢ Technology, Thermosphereâ„¢ Technology is the only actively buffered energy platform on the market and this novel and highly patented design is what separates the Emprintâ„¢ with Thermosphereâ„¢ Technology platform from any other brands/equipment on the market. This technology is to give a large reproducible and highly predictable spherical ablation field across various environments and tissue types with only one type of antenna. For future procurements, the VA will survey the industry to find other suitable potential vendors that can provide the preventative maintenance for the Emprint Procedure Planning Application

6. Contracting Officer's Certification: Purchase is approved in accordance with FAR13.106-1(b). I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Justification and Approval (J&A)
For
Other Than Full and Open Competition (>$150K)

Acquisition Plan Action ID: VA241-15-AP-6804 

1.	Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 1, Bedford Medical Center
VA241-15-AP-6804 initiated the request for a cable service installation at the Bedford Medical Center. 518-16-3-4825-0023 is the funded request for the installation of wiring for the medical center. 

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  
Bedford VAMC has an immediate need for a new cable service provider to install and maintain cable services throughout the medical center. The current vendor, Direct TV will not adhere to the FAR regulations or sign Federal contract. A firm-fixed price contract will be awarded with specific line items for the installation portion, base year of initial monthly services with 4 annual option years, exercised at the discretion of the Government.

FAR13.5 Simplified Procedures for Certain Commercial Items:  
This procurement is for cable installation and services in accordance with FAR 13.5 Simplified Procedures for Certain Commercial Items and specifically FAR 13.501 Special Documentation Requirements, where acquisitions conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures are exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, but still require a justification using the format of FAR 6.303-2. 

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  
Cable installation services will take an estimated 60 days for completion at $51, 680.53.
Estimated aggregate contract total inclusive of all option years is $415,860.65 and priced out per Option Year. 

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition: 

	( x)  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
	
FAR13.5 Simplified Procedures for Certain Commercial Items:  The authority for applying the Simplified Procedures for Commercial Items of  FAR 13.5 is 41 U.S.C. 1901 and is implemented by for restricting competition on this procurement via FAR 13.106-1(b)(2). 

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):  

Only One Responsible Source (FAR 6.302-1) 
6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  RCN Net and Verizon were both contacted and confirmed in writing they were not able to service Bedford and it is included in the contract file. 

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  The contracting officer negotiated rates based on other awarded cable service contracts in the VISN, to ensure rates were in line with other station needs. Final installation costs were dropped by $30,000 based on the original quote submitted. The original timeline was negotiated from six months to 60 days. 

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  See item 6.

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  A notice of intent to sole source was posted on 8/14/15, VA241-15-N-0766 and yielded zero results.

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  None

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  
The VA will continue to survey the market upon each Option Year expiration date to ensure the pricing is still in the best interest of the Government. 

12.	Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
