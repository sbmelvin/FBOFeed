<CONTACT>Roy Peters Contracting Officer's Rep. 5205380409     Roy_L_Peters@nbc.gov;
<DESC><B>I. INTRODUCTION:</B> <P> The Department of the Interior, National Business Center (NBC), Acquisition and Property Management Division, Southwest Branch, Fort Huachuca AZ, acting as the contracting agent for the Intelligence Technology Innovation Center (ITIC) and other Intelligence Community, Defense, and Homeland Security agencies, invites the submission of research proposals for developing technology that partially or fully automates aspects of the process of acquiring information from text documents and other natural language-based sources. Government information analysts need dramatic improvements over today's capabilities in order to be able to accomplish their analytic tasks in the future. <P> This Research Program is seeking to develop innovative algorithms, technologies, linguistic resources, and linguistic resource methodologies to address the program goals. This broad area announcement (BAA) seeks focused research efforts that advance the state of the art in Natural Language Processing technologies for English, Arabic, Chinese, and certain other major or less-commonly taught languages (LCTL). The following Research Areas address the Program's goals:<OL> <LI><U><B>Partial Semantic Content Processing for Entities, </B></U>including Entity Detection and Tracking (EDT) or Information Extraction (IE) of Entities; name parsing, translation and transliteration; entity-based document clustering and summarization <LI><U><B>Partial Semantic Content Processing for Relations, </B></U>including Relation Detection and Tracking (RDT) or Relation Extraction; relation-based document clustering and summarization. <LI><U><B>Partial Semantic Content Processing for Events. </B></U>Event Detection and Tracking or Event Extraction <LI><U><B>&quot;Full&quot; Semantic Content Processing, </B></U>including representation of document content in a logical form or other representation language; full-document machine translation (MT) <LI><U><B>Linguistic Resource Creation and Validation, </B></U>including mass production of corpora and annotated corpora, lexicons, and certain basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) components for LCTLs; lexical and semantic resources such as ontologies and wordnets; training and testing resources to support Tasks 1-4 <LI><U><B>Evaluation Methodology Research,</B></U> for each of the above categories </OL><P> Research in a number of areas may be needed to address program goals, including Machine Translation, Information Extraction, Semantic Analysis, and certain aspects of Text Summarization and Document Clustering.  <P> For this BAA, each of the above Research Areas is subdivided into specific areas of research. For greater detail, see the Proposal Information Pamphlet at <A HREF=http://www.nbc.gov/reflex.html>http://www.nbc.gov/reflex.html.</A>     <P> This BAA anticipates the award of multiple proposals.  Awards will be determined by availability of funds, so not all proposals rated as selectable will be funded. Awards will not necessarily be made for each of the Research Areas listed above. <P> <B>II. OBJECTIVES:</B>   <P> The National Business Center is soliciting research proposals to advance the process of converting information from documents and other language-based sources into forms that can best be used in the analytic process. These &quot;documents&quot; can be in English or one or more foreign languages; they could be written text, or spoken or image data that has been converted into text or text-like form via ASR or OCR; they could be in a range of genres; and they could be on a variety of topics or domains. There are two broad use cases where this research program's technology will be used.<UL> <LI><B>Assistance to information analysts: </B>Automated tools will assist human analysts in judging, quickly and accurately, the utility of individual documents in English or one or more foreign languages, and of clusters of documents that are related topically or along certain other dimensions; and in identifying specific facts or other items of interest from single documents or sets/clusters of documents. A long-term goal is to allow the human analyst to be able to perform accurate information analysis from an automatically-produced English-language translation or from an automatically-produced condensed English-language textual or non-textual rendition (summary) of a document or document cluster, instead of from the foreign language original(s). <LI><B>Input to automated analytic tools: </B>Automated technology will generate fully structured, language-independent representations of information as input to analytic tools; this representation would be based on unstructured information conveyed in a single document or a document cluster in English or one or more foreign languages. The analytic tools include various knowledge-base population or analysis tools, social network analysis tools, and the like.</UL><P> <B>III. GENERAL INFORMATION</B> <P> An individual proposal may address a number of subtopics of research areas identified in the Proposal Information Pamphlet, at the URL given above. An individual proposal must identify explicitly which Research Areas sections, subsections, and subsubsections (where given) are being addressed. However, <B>each proposal must show a coherent project direction in the range of tasks covered.</B>  Multiple proposals, each covering a specific research direction (potentially tasks from multiple Research Areas, sections, and subsections, etc.) may be submitted by a single offeror. However, where multiple Research Areas sections, subsections, and subsubsections are addressed, separate technical, cost and deliverable information must be provided for the work proposed.  <P> The REFLEX Program is open to all research and development organizations located in the U.S., including large and small businesses; academic and eligible non-profit and not-for-profit institutions; collaborative ventures from mixed sources; and Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs).  Teaming between industry, independent research centers and academia is encouraged, and commercial technology may be leveraged wherever possible.

<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) intends to award a sole source cost-plus fixed-fee follow-on contract to Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) to provide MDA Front Office/Executive Management Council support services and scientific, engineering, and technical assistance (SETA) to the MDA/DB, DS and DT Directorates to support near-term engineering, integration, field testing, management and execution of the MDA Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) mission and achievement of Initial Defense Operations (IDO).  The contract will be for fifteen (15) months.  This extension is for the minimum amount of time necessary to avoid disruption of services essential to achieving BMDS IDO capability.  This action will assure uninterrupted, essential continuity of unique highly technical engineering, analytical and support services required to support MDA’s near-term BMDS mission and IDO objectives, and will assure that during this period of mission focus on reaching a near-term operational capability MDA will maintain the critically needed skill-set capability to keep MDA executing on a sensitive and timely schedule.  CSC is the only company that has the current, requisite expertise to maintain the level of support required by the MDA in the near-term.  Current CSC personnel are key to preserving the Agency’s real-time integrated strategic capability while ensuring reliability, consistency, management, and response times needed to support the Agency’s mission.  No other source would have the necessary level of expertise relating to both MDA research and program activities, or could achieve the required level without significant delays and cost that would impact MDA’s ability to achieve IDO and support the BMDS without negatively impacting MDA's ability to comply with critical short and near-term mission requirements.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, San Diego (SSC San Diego), intends to issue modification #P00002 against contract N66001-03-D-5063 with Synergy Microsystems, Inc., of San Diego, California.  The modification will be issued on a sole-source basis using the procedures of FAR Subpart 13.5 - Test Program for Certain Commercial Items (Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996). The modification increases the contract ceiling quantity of VSS4/GR Quad PPC 750 DSP array processor boards by 150 units.  SSC San Diego requires a single board array processor system to perform signal processing system control and interface for the Advanced Modular Electronics Distant Sentinel (AMEDS) Receiver System.  The board must utilize a VERSAmodule Eurocard (VME64) interface and provide enough processing power for high-speed Digital Signal Processing (DSP) algorithmic computations.  The array processor system must consist of two SCSI interface ports, two RS-232 Serial interfaces, an Ethernet 10/100 Base-T interface, and a PCI Mezzanine interface.  The array processor must meet the performance minimum of 3.5 GFLOPS and support the LINUX operating system.  The board's physical dimensions must be compatible with the VME64 back plane and comply with chassis volume restrictions.  Delivery to SSC San Diego will be required within 45 days upon issuance of delivery order.  The VSS4/GR Quad PPC 750 DSP is the only array processor board that meets these requirements and is compatible with the software driver interfaces used int he AMEDS Receiver System.  Use of any other vendor would result in extensive costs associated with having to rewrite all of the software driver interfaces to accomodate a different array processor board.  It is not expected that these costs would be recovered through competition.  This is not a request for proposal and no solicitation is available.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, San Diego (SSC San Diego), intends to issue modification #P0001 against contract N66001-03-D-5064 with Eclipse Electronic Systems, Inc., of Richardson, Texas.  The modification will be issued on a sole-source basis using the procedures of FAR Subpart 13.5 - Test Program for Certain Commercial Items (Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996).  The modification increases the contract ceiling quantity of R3100 VMEbus Tuners by 100 units.  The R3100 VMEbus Tuner is a single-board VERSAmodule Eurocard (VME) dual-channel receiver used with the Advanced Modular Electronics Distant Sentinel (AMEDS) Receiver System.  Each receiver must have an input range between 100 to 500 MHz, a high tuning resolution, an IF bandwidth of 10 MHz, and utilize the RACEway data bus.  The inteneded use of the receiver is to perform RF signal capture and interface withthe Advanced Modular Electronics Distant Sentinel (AMEDS) Receiver System.  The VME dual-channel receiver will be utilized in imbedded collection system applications where it is desired to couple the receiver control and output Digital Signal Processing.  The receiver must function in the severe self-induced electromagnetic interference environment encountered in a 37 VME card cage.  The receiver board's physical dimensions must be compatible with the VME back plane and comply with chassis volume restrictions.  Delivery to SSC San diego will be required within 3 months upon issuance of delivery order.  The R3100 VMEbus Tuner manufactured by Eclipse Electronic Systems is the only receiver that meets these requirements and is compatible with the software driver interfaces used in the AMEDS Receiver System.  Use of any other vendor would result in extensive costs associated with having to rewrite all of the software driver interfaces to accommodate a different receiver.  It is not expected that these costs would be recovered through competition.  This is not a request for proposal and no solicitation is available.

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) invites you to submit a proposal for small class expendable launch vehicle services to be provided under the NASA Launch Services (NLS) contract.  The original NASA Launch Services (NLS) RFP was issued on October 18, 1999, resulting in the award of Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) task order contracts to Boeing Delta Launch Services, Inc. and Lockheed Martin Commercial Launch Services, Inc.  The original solicitation remains open until June 30, 2010 through the use of an innovative on-ramp provision found in Section C, Clause 2.0.   On a semi-annual basis, NASA invites new, emerging domestic launch service providers that meet the minimum contract requirements and current contract holders who wish to on-ramp new launch services to submit proposals during an open season.  The open season for proposal submission is the entire month of February and August of each calendar year.	 The synopsis notice posted on February 6, 2004 for the February 2004 open season included a notice that NASA anticipated the issuance of a separate synopsis for expansion of the NLS performance range to include small class expendable launch vehicle services.   Pursuant to that notice, this synopsis invites current NLS contract holders and new emerging domestic launch providers that meet the minimum contract requirements for small class launch vehicle services to submit on-ramp proposals to NASA in accordance with the instructions in this notice.   This performance range expansion is consistent with RFP Section C, Clause 2.3, “Expansion of Performance Capabilities”.  Minimum NLS launch capabilities are generally described in the solicitation as the capability to deliver a 1500kg payload to orbit at an altitude of 200km and a launch inclination of 28.5 degrees.   The solicitation is being amended in accordance with Section C, Clause 2.3 to expand the performance range capabilities by reducing the minimum payload delivery capability from 1500kg to  250kg, with altitude and inclination as referenced above.   On or about March 22, 2004, the revised solicitation will be released as RFP 10-00-0021, Revision 1.  Upon release, an open season for small class expendable launch vehicle services proposals will commence, with proposals due 60 days from the date Revision 1 is issued.   During this open season, NASA will entertain proposals for small class launch services, defined as those launch services for payloads between the amended minimum capability (250kg) and the previous NLS minimum capability (1500kg).   Future NLS open seasons will invite proposals for the full range of NLS performance, including medium/heavy capability as well as the newly added small class capability. NASA will conduct a Pre-Proposal Conference at KSC on or about April 6, 2004 to familiarize potential offerors with the NLS solicitation, and answer questions concerning the solicitation.  Companies interested in attending this Conference must advise the Contracting Officer (see Point of Contact information at the end of the synopsis) by no later than March 29, 2004, and provide the names of the personnel who wish to attend. Proposals should be mailed or hand carried to:  NASA, John F. Kennedy Space Center Mail Stop: OP-LS, Attn: Jeanette A.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Rebecca Clausen, Purchasing Agent, Phone (919) 541-3002
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541990   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency intends to negotiate a sole source purchase order with Dr. Rakesh Singh, Kitchener, Ontario, Canada to improve the methodology for modeling human exposures to motor vehicle emissions. The overall project goal is to develop improved methods for modeling source emissions to human exposure through the air pathway, within significant microenvironments of exposure. Roadway dispersion models use the source strength of particles or gases in terms of concentration per unit distance (e.g. milligrams per mile, mg/mi) as an input to  predict particle or gas concentrations in space or time. Detailed and correct knowledge of emission characteristics is therefore an essential prerequisite along with other information supporting a source-to-receptor human exposure model.  In view of this need, a microscale emission factor model for  predicting environmentally relevant real-time motor vehicle particulate matter (MicroFacPM) emissions for total suspended particulate matter (TSP) , PM10 (particulate matter less than 10  m aerodynamic diameter) and PM2.5 (particulate matter less than 2.5  m aerodynamic diameter) is being  developed.  The MicroFacPM model uses modeling concepts and structure similar to that used in the development of MicroFacCO, which has been documented in peer-reviewed journal publications. The framework for MicroFacCO and MicroFacPM has been principally developed by Dr. Rakesh Singh.  Developments  of the MicroFacCO and MicroFacPM framework have been summarized and discussed at several conferences and workshops.   Currently, MicroFac models are not suitable for studies in urban areas consisting of intersections, where the driving mode consists of stop and go cycles having significance  acceleration, deceleration, cruise, creeping and idle modes.   The initial award will be for development of a method of modal emission rates per vehicle class and/ or age to support the extension of MicroFacCO and MicroFacPM for intersection modeling and development of an initial framework for a   MicroFac AirToxics version. Options will be established for determination of the feasibility of implementation of the methods and framework developed in the initial award for MicroFacCO,  MicroFacPM, and MicroFacAirToxics.  Provided the methods and framework are determined to be feasible and  contingent on the availability of funds the EPA will exercise options for the contractor to develop the modal emission rates by analyzing available measurement data required to support full implementation of the MicroFac models.  The circumstance permitting Other than Full and Open Competition  Justification is FAR 6.301-2, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements".  The period of performance is expected to be from April 2004 through September 2004 exclusive of options. This is a non-commercial purchase.  All interested parties who  believe they can provide the required services should fully explain their capabilities and qualifications in writing within 15 days from the date of this announcement.  The intent of this synopsis is to determine if any source(s) exist and, therefore, no RFQ is available.  Consequently, any  response(s) failing to provide the aforementioned data but instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will not be honored.  Submit your response to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, RTP Procurement Operations Division (E105-02), Attn: Rebecca Clausen,  Research Triangle Park, NC 27711 or e-mail clausen.rebecca@epa.gov.

<DESC>PEO STRI is soliciting information regarding the availability of virtual training systems to be utilized to train drivers and gunners of military vehicles to identify a potential ambush, how to identify improvised explosive devices (IEDs), how to avoid an ambush, how to return fire, maneuver and to react appropriately in the Contemporary Operating Environment (COE).  

HISTORY:

Recent combat operations have demonstrated the need for convoy combat training.  Our soldiers are more vulnerable than what we expected performing vehicular patrols and engaging in convoy operations.  

PURPOSE:

The purpose of this RFI is to assess for the Army existing training device solutions or solutions that could be provided as training devices in three (3) months to meet current known convoy operation training deficiencies.  Based on this assessment, the Army could potentially pursue an urgent sole-source acquisition.  Any award for a Virtual Combat Convoy Trainer would be made pursuant to FAR 6.302-2 Unusual and Compelling Urgency to that firm who provides the best overall value to the Government in the area of technical, schedule and price.  Technical is somewhat more important than schedule with price being the least important element.  When combined technical and schedule are more important than price.


REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI):

Interested parties are requested to review the requirements and information stated below and provide your written responses NLT 22 Mar 2004, which may be followed by a demonstration of your system at a location to be later identified. The demo is tentatively scheduled for the week 5-9 April.  The Government reserves the right, based on its review of the provided documentation, to issue a invitation to the demo or not.  Demos are at an offerors own expense.  

The demonstration will include a technical assessment of the system by PEO STRI as to the systems capability to meet or exceed the goals as set below.  There will be a question and answer period for users with the contractors, which will be followed by a PEO STRI recommendation to the proponent.  

GOALS:

1.	Trainer must simulate attacks by assailants with small arms, rocket propelled grenades (RPGs), improvised explosive devices (IEDs), and a combination of these methods.

2.	All threat weapons systems must be correctly depicted.  IEDs are typically made from artillery rounds, mines, plastic explosives, RDX (extremely powerful powdered explosive), and ammonium nitrate combined with diesel fuel. Visual models of threats must be accurate, in accordance with the COE.

3.	Ambushes must correctly depict the execution of ambushes in the COE from arrangement to execution.  The trainer shall correctly indicate friendly forces that are disabled, injured or killed in the scenario.  

4.	System must allow for scenario editing the combination of threat weapons, assailants, and techniques and the operational environment.  The scenario must accurately simulate the COE to include non-combatants, urban clutter, and the consequences of engagements.  The trainer shall have the capability to edit terrain, allowing the instructor to replicate any environment in the COE.

5.	The trainer must demonstrate and score the consequences for the use of tactics techniques and procedures and reward proper technique and identify areas for improvement.  

6.	Trainer must accommodate current US military vehicles used in vehicle convoys, as they are employed in the COE. At a minimum, simulated vehicles must include the High Mobility Multi-Purpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV), the Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV) and the Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT).  Vehicle personnel must include the driver, the gunner in the turret ring and several additional riflemen as appropriate.  Each shooter must be able to view the environment independent of other soldiers and react individually.

7.	Trainer must accommodate the current US military weapons used to defend convoys.  

8.	The trainer must have an After Action Review (AAR) system or process that includes simultaneously capturing virtual data and voice communications for playback and analysis.

9.	There must be a plan for total support for the trainer in improved and austere environments.  Exchange of damaged parts must occur within five working days or turn in of the damaged component.  The trainer must have a mean time between failures of 500 hours and the possibility of a warranty for a period of at least 3 years.

10.	The trainer must be rapidly fielded, deployed and employed in improved and austere environments.

11.	Trainer must be easily transportable by C5/C17 or ocean vessel.

12.  Trainers must be available for fielding within the next 3-6 months, preferably 3 months.


INFORMATION REQUIRED

1.	Description of trainer currently available and how each of the above goals are met or exceeded.

2.	Lead time for manufacture of trainers and production capacity and capability

3.	Describe the system safety issues.

4.	Supportability of trainer.

5.	Price range for trainer.

5. There must be a full description of the set-up and tear-down of the trainer.

6.	POC of customers that are currently using this trainer or similar products.

7.	If your company's trainer does not currently meet the stated requirements, lead time required to have compliant trainers and modifications required.

8.	Past Performance: Years of experience in building virtual trainers.

9.	Listing of Software/hardware being delivered with less than Government Purpose Rights.

10.	Describe proposed Warranty

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>THIS MODIFICATION IS ISSUED TO CORRECT DUE DATE FOR SUBMISSION OF PROPOSALS, REVISE DATES F0R SITE VISITS AND TO POST ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY OFFERORS. 1.  The Due Date for responses to this RFP, both technical and cost, shall be via email at rhonda.fernandez@mms.gov on before Monday, Mrch 29, 2004.  Site Visits will be Friday March 12, 2004 and Tuesday March 16, 2004.  Additional details regarding site visits are posted below. 2.  For this project would you accept a joint-venture? Two companies working together. 2a.  Yes.  A joint-venture which identified the responsibilities and relationship between the firms as well as how the Committee would interact with both would be an acceptable business arrangement. (3.   (1)       The Avaya Intuity Voice Mail System does not work directly with the IP Office.  Should we use the IP Office Voice Mail Pro instead? 2)       What is the VS - 100 Voice Synthesizer?  Is this an Avaya product? 3)       What phone will the Wireless Headset (LKA 10) work with, a digital 2420, 6408, or the analog 6211?  (3a)  1)  The Committee?s research indicates that the Intuity will work with the IP office product.  The Committee is not considering Voice Mail Pro.   2)  The VS-100 is manufactured by Starcom and marketed through Avaya. 3)  The LKA 10 will work with a digital telephone. (4).  The Committee will not entertain alternate system proposals at this time. (5).      I will coordinate site visits dates directly and can be reached at 703-603-7749.  We have allocated six slots on each day. (6).  Can we get a current Intuity Audix configuration report showing the version, number of ports and features that are activated in the current system?  This is important to provide accurate upgrade pricing. The Committee?s current system includes Intuity Voicemail Release 4.0 with 4 ports, but only 3 ports are in use.  A physical examination of the equipment and read-only display for the current system will be allowed during scheduled site visits.   (6a).  It is not possible for me to provide an Intuity Audix configuration report.  The password to access the Administrative account for the system is lost.   (7).  Where is the place of performance ?? How do we get access to the location?? What kind of switch  is evolved ?? Who is the Incumbent ??  (7a)  1)  Place of Performance is the Committee's offices located at 1421 Jefferson Davis Highway, Suite 10-800, Arlington, Virginia 22202. 2)  I will coordinate access to the facility for a site visit.  Please contact me (Janice Coleman) at 703-603-7749 ext 111 to arrange a time and date. 3)  All equipment is available for inspection during a site visit. Model numbers and manufacturer information can be taken directly from the equipment. 3)  There is no incumbent contractor(s).  The original 1997 installation was arranged by the General Services Administration.  I do not have any information on that firm.   (8)  The Committee has determined that its requirements for telecommunications systems, to include telephone and voice messaging, are best served by upgrading and modernizing current equipment using the same voice-based technical solution.  The Committee staff solicited expert technical recommendations and conducted independent market analysis to compare technical solutions offered by different types of providers with platforms based in data versus voice technologies.  This analysis indicated that the best value to the Government is to solicit multiple sources for bids to upgrade current systems using the same technical solution offered by Avaya systems.  Installation, maintenance, and training services will be the primary consideration in source selection, as vendors are expected to offer pricing within an expected competitive range for the specific equipment.

As used in this clause- Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database means the primary Government repository for Contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government. Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&B) to identify unique business entities. Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number means the DUNS number assigned by D&B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same parent concern. Registered in the CCR database means that- (1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and (2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields and has marked the record Active. (b)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation. (2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation DUNS or DUNS +4 followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the offeror's name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database. (c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. (1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number- (i) If located within the United States, by calling Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 or via the Internet at http://www.dnb.com; or (ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. (2) The offeror should be prepared to provide the following information: (i) Company legal business. (ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized. (iii) Company Physical Street Address, City, State, and Zip Code. (iv) Company Mailing Address, City, State and Zip Code (if separate from physical). (v) Company Telephone Number. (vi) Date the company was started. (vii) Number of employees at your location. (viii) Chief executive officer/key manager. (ix) Line of business (industry). (x) Company Headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity). (d) If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror. (e) Processing time, which normally takes 48 hours, should be taken into consideration when registering. Offerors who are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation. (f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (g) (1) (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of Payment paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. (2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of payment paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (h) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.   Quotes are due by close of business 04/16/04 at the SW Idaho/Nevada Acquisition Office, 1249 S. Vinnell Way, Ste 200, Boise, Idaho 83709.  FAX quotes will be accepted at 208-373-4197.

The activities under study include:  Animal Caretakers (Series WG-5048):  This occupation includes work that involves providing care for mammals, reptiles, birds, and fish. The work requires knowledge of the animals' characteristics, needs, and behavior, and skill in observing, handling, and controlling them in both indoor and outdoor settings. The work also involves knowledge of general maintenance procedures and the ability to operate related equipment.  Biological Science Technicians (Series GS-404):  Biological science technicians provide practical technical support to production, research, operations, or program administration efforts in laboratories, field, or other settings including greenhouses, barns, fish hatcheries, and wildlife refuges. This work requires knowledge of laboratory procedures and data collection; understanding of wildlife biology, botany, and wildlife management terminology; and skills in operating and maintaining motorized vehicles. The work also requires the ability to communicate verbally with the public.  These competitions will follow the guidelines prescribed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76.  Further information on competitive sourcing at DOI can be obtained at http://www.doi.gov/perfmgt/competitivesourcing.

<DESC>This is being provided as "Information Only" to the synopsis entitled NASA Cooperative Agreement Notice (CAN) - NASA Student involvement Program (NSIP) which was posted on January 21, 2004.  Since the lastest modification posting, two questions have been posed.  The following are the questions with its corresponding responses: Question: I am writing for clarification to Modification 3, dated March 9, to NASA Solicitation Number: CAN-04-HRE-02, NASA Student Involvement Program (NSIP).  Modification 3 extended the deadline for proposals to March 15, 2004.  It also noted that "You are notified that additional information is being provided for your consideration in preparing your proposal."  This additional information consists of a PDF file for an NSIP newsletter.  What is the significance of this attachment to the solicitation?  Does this represent a change in scope for the proposed work?  Or is it truly just informational?	Please provide guidance. Response: The purpose of the amendment was to provide this information to all offerors. It is for information only and does  not represent a change in scope for the proposed work. Question: The Spring 2004 NSIP newsletter announces the 2004-2005 competitions and associated grade levels.  However, the NSIP CAN SPECIFICALLY calls for an "outline of suggested competitions" which we included in our proposal.  Would you be kind enough to clarify this apparent conflict?  With regard to the inclusion of electronic materials within our proposal, our organization did prepare a one minute prototype CD video for distribution to schools announcing the 2004-2005 NSIP theme competition.  Do we have any provision for inclusion copies this CD with the proposal? Response: There is no conflict.  The announcement of the 2004-2005 competitions was posted for information only and will not impact your "outline of suggested competitions".  All ideas from all offerors for the future of this program are encouraged.  There is no provision for a CD video and it is your choice to include it or not in your submission. The due date for responses is March 15, 2004. Documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/HQ Business Opportunities home page is http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=04  Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation and any amendments.

<DESC>The first modification issued this date completely replaced the description of the synopsis.  This second modification provides answers to questions received to date.  

NOTE:  Any inconsistency between this document and the synopsis shall be resolved by giving precedence to the synopsis including all modifications. 

QUESTION 1: 	Is registration with the Central Contractor Register required?

ANSWER:   	Yes.  The synopsis description has been amended to include the requirement.  

QUESTION 2: 	Is the response date still April 12, 2004 by 4:00 p.m.?  

ANSWER:	Yes, April 12, 2004 by 4:00 p.m. local time.

QUESTION 3:	Please advise if a one-person firm with available subcontractors can respond and compete for this project.

ANSWER:	The ID/IQ A/E service contract will have multiple task orders issued at different times, with many being performed simultaneously for more than one geographic location.  Hydrology may or may not be part of projects for the next five years.  A hydrologist would, of necessity, subcontract the greater part of the work and provide the professional A/E warranty for each task order and the entire ID/IQ contract.  A one-person consultant firm can team with prospective prime consultant A/Es for work in the expertise arena.  

QUESTION 4:	There must be a way for large and small DBE firms to acknowledge who is available and capable.  The pre registration must be keyed so we can find out how to contact the large firms and offer our services. 

ANSWER:	The synopsis has been amended as follows:  “Interested parties are encouraged to register to receive changes and register for the interested vendor list.”  The option to “View List of Interested Vendors” has also been added.  

QUESTION 5:	This appears to be a single selection.  Is there any chance that it might be divided into a few smaller contracts that small businesses like PEC could handle as a prime?  

ANSWER:  	No.  The Government need is for one award, as advertised.  

QUESTION 6:	Who is currently under contract for these services? 

ANSWER:	MWH America’s, Inc. (MWH), is the incumbent contractor.

QUESTION 7:	What other firms have had this contract?

ANSWER:	There has only been one contract to MWH.  

QUESTION 8:	Is the IBWC pleased with the past consultants efforts?  

ANSWER:	Yes.
  
QUESTION 9: 	Is this a continuation of the existing contract or is it a solicitation for an additional provider?

ANSWER:	The ID/IQ is targeted for award 10-01-04 for a base year with four option years.  It is a new contract providing follow-on A/E service from the current contract that expires 09-30-04.

<CONTACT>Ruth Maggs, Contract Specialist, Phone 717 770-5931, Fax 717 770-5689, Email Ruth.Maggs@dla.mil
<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis.  The Defense Logistic Agency (DLA) is planning to assume control of the current physical distribution operations and local transportation to support Commander Naval Forces Marianas (COMNAVMAR) in the Territory of Guam. The requirements are the supply annex requirements that were referenced in Addendum 6 to synopsis, Solicitation N62742-03-R-3501, for the Base Operations Support (BOS) Services, Territory of Guam issued by the Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Pacific Division.  A copy of solicitation N62742-03-R-3501 is available at http://www.esol.navfac.navy.mil.  The transition period to a successor contractor is expected to begin in the June/July 2004 timeframe.  The Government plans to release a formal solicitation to FedBizOps in March 2004.

Current Supply Department operations include the full scope of physical distribution functions typically performed at DLA managed distribution centers including receipt of Navy retail and wholesale replenishment receipts, processing of material turned into stores (MTIS) through a partnership established with Defense Distribution Depot, Pearl Harbor (DDPH), direct-turn-over and off-island transshipment, storage and care of stock in storage (COSIS), issue of retail and wholesale material, packing, shipping and local delivery.   The physical distribution operations are government owned and contractor operated (GOCO).  
Inventory management is currently supported by the combined inventory control efforts of FISC Pearl Harbor (for Navy retail stock) and NAVICP (for Navy wholesale).  All accountable stock records are currently maintained on UADPS.  UADPS supports demand (MRO) processing, dues management, item data maintenance actions and other inventory control functions.  

The Government intends to issue the RFP as a 100 percent set-aside for small business, with a "cascade" provision to unrestricted.  This means that as long as responsible small businesses respond to the solicitation and have the capability/capacity to perform the work, an award will be made under the set-aside.  If no responsive, responsible small business offers at a reasonable price, the solicitation will automatically convert to an unrestricted buy.  At that time any large business submitting offers will be considered for award.

This notice is not a request for offers.  Interested responsible businesses must submit sufficient information to assess your company’s ability to satisfy these requirements.  The capability statement must address: 1) Knowledge of Defense Distribution Center warehouse and distribution operations and special functions or similar type operations 2) Knowledge of and experience in the Distribution Standard System (DSS).  Please include POC information including e-mail address.  The capability statement shall not exceed five (5) pages. All responses must be submitted electronically in a Microsoft compatible file format (e.g., word or pdf) to Ruth A. Maggs, ruth.maggs@dla.mil, by 2:00 p.m. EST, Monday, April 14, 2004.  Government Point of Contact for all questions is Ruth A. Maggs, 717-770-5931.

<DESC>The goal of this six-month-long project is to conduct an audit of the financial statements of the Armenian Potable Water and Sewage Company (APWSC).   The objective of the audit is to enable the auditor to express an opinion on the financial statements of the APWSC insofar as they are prepared in accordance with the International Accounting Standards (IAS) as published by the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC).  The financial statements comprise the balance sheet as of December 31 for the calendar years 2002 and 2003 and the related statements of income and cash flows for those years. 

Under IAS 1, a complete set of financial statements includes the following components:
(a)	Balance sheet;
(b)	Income statement;
(c)	A statement showing either: (i) all changes in equity; or (ii) changes in equity other than those arising from capital transactions with owners and distributions to owners;
(d)	Cash flow statement; and
(e)	Accounting policies and explanatory notes.
IAS 27 requires that consolidated financial statements should be prepared where a parent has subsidiaries.    The APWSC’s accounting records provide the basis for preparation of the financial statements and were established to reflect the financial transactions in respect of the APWSC.

<CONTACT>James Knudsen, Contracting Officer, 304-285-1361, donald.hafer@netl.doe.gov;Donald Hafer, Contract Specialist, 304-285-1361, donald.hafer@netl.doe.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), is conducting a Market Survey to identify small businesses capable of providing specialized technical testing and analytical services to perform Characterization of Coal Utilization By-products from Mercury Control Field Testing. THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and NO contract will be awarded from this announcement.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 541380 with a size standard of $10.0 million.  The Contractor shall provide all facilities, supervision, personnel, tools, equipment, and services to perform the contract requirements. The Characterization of Coal Utilization By-products from Mercury Control Field Testing effort will analyze by-products for mercury and other toxic metal releases.  The by-products being tested are generated from mercury control projects awarded in 2003 and 2004 by NETL.  These projects utilize various technologies to remove the mercury from the flue gas at coal-burning electric power generating facilities.  Some of the technologies may deposit additional quantities of Hg onto the by-products.  Many by-products are used in high temperature applications or placed into environments where they will come in contact with water.  Therefore, it is imperative to understand any potential mercury pathways into the environment.  The goal of this effort will be to determine the ultimate fate of mercury in the by-product streams in order to guarantee that mercury removal from the flue gas is not counteracted by release of mercury from the by-products.  In doing so, this effort will support NETL?s Innovation for Existing Plants Program goals of maintaining current utilization practices of coal utilization by-products and increasing utilization to 50% by 2010.  Annually, the U.S. generates over 100 million tons of by-products and wishes to avoid large-scale disposal. Interested small business concerns must provide detailed descriptions of capability and demonstrated past experiences addressing each of the areas identified below: 1. Demonstrated experience conducting at least two of the following leaching methods on by-product samples:  TCLP, SGLP, SPLP, MWLP, and ASTM water leach for mercury and other trace metals. 2. Demonstrated experience conducting microbiological experimentation. 3. Demonstrated commercial relationships with coal burning electric utilities including at least two involving by-product testing or research. 4. Capability to provide the appropriate laboratory facilities, equipment and personnel (i.e. laboratory certification or accreditation) necessary to conduct experimentation and testing as scheduled.  This effort is not intended to fund the purchase of major equipment. 5. Demonstrated ability to store large quantities of by-products in accordance with RCRA and guarantee that upon completion of the testing that the materials will be disposed of in an appropriate manner complying with all State and Federal regulations (i.e. RCRA). 6. Demonstrated experience and knowledge of the mercury control regulatory process.  The purpose of gathering the data from this effort is for it to be used in potential future regulatory actions.  Experience should demonstrate that the Contractor has collected data to support regulatory action, standards, and/or has developed a unique method (i.e. leaching method or utilization method) associated with coal utilization by-products. 7. Capability of designing and providing a quality assurance/quality control plan that is based on experience in similar work with coal utilization by-products. 8. Demonstrated experience handling utility coal utilization by-products including fly ash and flue gas desulfurization materials.  This also includes a detailed understanding of where these by-products are generated in the power plant, understanding how different pollution control devices affect the by-product material and the effect of coal type on the by-product composition. 9. Demonstrated experience or capability of designing experiments to generate the liquid and gas samples from the by-product samples.  This includes how the designed experiments relate to the generation and disposal of by-products. 10. If subcontracting is anticipated, demonstrated experience in successfully managing subcontracts and a detailed description of how the Contractor guarantees the data provided under the subcontract including how this information would be supported/defended in future regulatory action (if any). Small business concerns responding to this market survey must submit their responses through via the Department of Energy Industry Interactive Procurement System (IIPS) no later than 4:00 PM Eastern Standard Time on April 13, 2004. The IIPS page is located at http://e-center.doe.gov .  At this Internet site you will be able to register with IIPS, enabling you to submit your response. Your response should be submitted using the ?Create Proposal? function in IIPS.  The respondent must then complete the required fields and attach their response to the link identified as ?Attach Volume I/Offer or Other Documents?. For consistency, the respondent is instructed to submit their response in either ?MS Word? (.doc) or Adobe Acrobat (.pdf) format. If you need technical assistance in registering or for any other IIPS function, call the IIPS Help Desk at (800) 683-0751 or email the Help Desk personnel at IIPS_HelpDesk@e-center.doe.gov. As indicated previously, this is not a solicitation therefore no cost or pricing information should be provided.  This is a market survey to identify small business concerns capable of performing the effort required. Responses should be limited to the Contractors expression of interest and demonstration of capabilities/experience based on the list provided.

<CONTACT>Jean M. Rogers, Contracting Officer, Phone (216) 433-2349, Fax (216) 433-5489, Email Jean.M.Rogers@grc.nasa.gov
<DESC>NASA/GRC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources to help formulate a plan to develop a closed cycle hydrogen-oxygen regenerative PEM Fuel Cell (RFC) system for use as an energy storage device for a future high altitude (60,000 ft or above), long endurance (HALE) remotely operated solar-electric aircraft (ROA).  Intended applications include Earth Science, Homeland Security, and commercial.  An RFC system is an electrochemical system that collects and stores solar energy during the day then releases that energy at night, thus making the Sun’s energy available 24/7. The RFC energy storage system consists of reactant storage/supply, power production (electrochemical conversion), water management, thermal management, automatic controls and health monitoring plus any ancillary equipment necessary for a fully functional energy storage system suitable for integration with a solar electric aircraft.  The solar array and aircraft power loads (e.g. motor, payload) are outside the scope of this sources sought synopsis.  While final requirements for the solar electric aircraft demonstrator are not currently available, projected characteristics and goals for the RFC system include: one or more modules with each providing 600 W-hr/kg specific energy, 5 kWe fuel cell power for up to 12 hrs, 0 - 15 kWe electrolyzer power consumption, reaction storage capacity sufficient to satisfy the stated fuel cell power production requirement, at least 50% round-trip efficiency, and at least one month service life.  The goals are reasonable estimations adequate for planning purposes.  To satisfy NASA’s tentative plans to proceed to a flight test, the technology must be developed to a technology readiness level of 6 (prototype tested in a relevant environment) by the end of 2009, including 6 months of NASA tests in a relevant environment; TRL definition is further clarified at: http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/codeq/trl/trl.pdf.   (note: please substitute “Flight” for “Space” since the referenced document was specifically developed for Space programs.) For planning purposes, the offeror shall assume a contract start date of April, 2005. NASA envisions three elements to the program: critical component technology development, integrated system development, and ground based demonstration.	The offeror may propose a comprehensive plan or focused effort(s) that address specific component technology gaps.  For the latter case, the offeror is expected to define current state-of-the-art, technology gap(s), relationship between the proposed component technology advancement and overall RFC system goal(s), and describe the method to incorporate its component technology into an integrated system development effort. NASA anticipates the effort to develop the integrated power system to a TRL of 6 will be conducted in two phases; each phase incorporating the elements described above.  Phase I will produce a “breadboard” test article tested for functionality and operability; and Phase II will produce a prototype suitable for testing in a relevant environment.  The integrated system development shall be accomplished through competitive solicitation(s).    Regarding the two phase approach, the goal for Phase I of the program is to advance the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of a “generic” RFC energy storage system to TRL-4 (breadboard tested in laboratory environment) and complete a conceptual design of a flight RFC system to show traceability.	For Phase I, the “breadboard” test article shall demonstrate functionality and operability of a closed-cycle hydrogen-oxygen RFC with traceability to the projected solar electric aircraft goals stated above.  For planning purposes, the RFC breadboard shall be capable of demonstrating multiple 10’s of cycles (power production, energy storage) with no discernable degradation and no intervention required.  The RFC system shall provide 5 kW of power for a continuous period up to 12 hrs during power generation mode and it shall require up to 15 kW of power during energy storage mode.  NASA estimates a 2 year period of performance for Phase I, but will consider an alternative schedule by the offeror if justified. NASA anticipates at least two procurement awards using the Best Value Selection (BVS) source selection method for Phase I.   The goal of Phase II is to further advance the technology to TRL-6 (prototype tested in relevant environment) and focus the development on the specifications and requirements for the flight RFC system; for planning purposes, the offeror shall assume detailed aircraft power requirements and interface specifications are provided prior to the initiation of Phase II.  Phase II will likely be implemented as a single procurement award using the Best Value Selection (BVS) source selection method to accomplish Phase II.   Each phase of the program will culminate in the fabrication and test of appropriate system hardware.  For both Phase I and Phase II, testing of the system shall include vendor testing followed by independent NASA testing.  Approximately four months of NASA testing is planned for Phase I, with 6 months planned for Phase II.   Though NASA envisions two phases to complete system development to TRL of 6, NASA will consider a single phase approach if justified by the offeror; justification criteria should include, but not necessarily be limited to, overall program cost, schedule, and program risk.	NASA seeks comments regarding the different approaches to help decide the best strategy with respect to meeting the 2009 goal, total cost, and program risk. NASA seeks information for each element and phase including technology gap(s), task descriptions, schedules, and ROM budgets at the task level per year.  NASA is also interested in obtaining comments addressing schedule acceleration impact on budget and program risk.   Appropriate offerors are anticipated to be fuel cell stack/electrolyzer vendors as well as experienced aerospace hardware integrators teamed with fuel cell stack and electrolyzer vendor(s).  Although the Source Sought Synopsis is open to all companies, the Request for Proposal (RFP), if it is released, would stipulate that only U.S. companies could propose as prime contractors because the technology will likely be Export Controlled.  A number of value characteristics will be included in the RFP solicitation.  These include, but are not limited to, items such as safety, cost, reliability, ease of maintainability, innovativeness of ideas, ability to accommodate stacks from multiple vendors, and past power plant and/or aerospace system integration experience. The purpose of this Sources Sought Synopsis is to solicit input from industry for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.	Respondents will not be notified of the evaluation results from the responses to the synopsis. The RFP solicitation to follow does not exist at this time, but if and when the solicitation is released, it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service. It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor these sites for release of any solicitation or synopsis.  The anticipated release date is September 1, 2004. Sources Sought Synopsis responses of twenty pages or less (no smaller than font size 10) are due to NASA by April 23, 2004 and should include the following: 1.  Brief description of technology state-of-the-art. 2.  Comments on alternative programmatic approaches identified hereinabove with rationale for selecting the proposed approach. 3.  Comments on reasonableness and feasibility on the schedule constraints and TRL goals.  4.  Appropriate schedule, task description, and budget allocation. 5.  The fidelity of hardware and integration that can be accomplished in each phase based on the schedule constraints and TRL goals. 6.  Capability statement including demonstration of ability and qualifications (market/application of existing PEMFC stacks and/or ancillary components). All responses shall be submitted via e-mail or mail to the attention of Jean M. Rogers, Contracting Officer, NASA Glenn Research Center, 21000 Brookpark Rd, MS 500-305, Cleveland, OH 44135, no later than April 23, 2004. Please reference NNC04Z06003L in any response.

<DESC>The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) requests information and comments from manufacturers and other interested parties concerning the availability of wireless communications headsets specifically designed for use within firearms training ranges.  The objective of this request is to obtain information concerning equipment availability, specific frequency band compatibility, power output, coverage area, voice activated transmission, cost, noise dampening, battery technology, user controls, headset LCD screens, maintenance, and service support.  Background:  The Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, headquartered in Glynco, GA covers an area of 1500 acres and borders Brunswick, GA to the east and St. Simons Island to the north.  FLETC provides a wide variety of law enforcement training for over 70 federal agencies throughout the United States.  A large majority of students are trained in the use of firearms using one of 14 ranges on the Glynco campus as well as a number of ranges located on the Charleston, SC, Cheltenham, MD, and Artesia, NM campuses.   FLETC utilizes both indoor and outdoor firing ranges. Typical indoor ranges consist of concrete floors, concrete wall structures, a bulletproof glass control center, and partitioned ceiling sections partially open to the sky or fully enclosed with metal ceilings and acoustic dampening material. The outdoor ranges are fully exposed to all the climatic elements. The ranges operate independently and require wireless communications localized to each range facility.   The FLETC is interested in wireless headsets for each instructor to enhance the current methods of communications. The headsets are expected to improve instructor communications among one another in administering classes, in grading students, and in halting the firing of weapons in the event of an emergency. Additionally, a desk module is required for use within the soundproof control tower allowing other audible communications devices to be heard within the same room.  This is a Request for Information (RFI) for commercial and/or non-commercial headsets that can meet the specific needs of the FLETC.  Respondents shall provide the following information:  (1)  Indicate a wireless headset system specifically associated with noise dampening technologies and standards; (2) Identify and provide technical specifications for products currently available that either operate across licensed U.S. Government VHF, UHF frequency bands (roughly 162-174VHF and 406-420UHF), and/or use unlicensed frequencies if voice privacy is available. If active product development activities are underway, identify these products and indicate where and when they will be available and first deployed; (3)  Indicate the proposed headset transmission technologies necessary to function in a large indoor area with 5 to 10 instructors. Radio coverage must be able to support indoor areas in excess of 100 yards in length. Neighboring ranges operate simultaneously, so multiple channels must also be available to avoid interference:  (4)  Indicate the proposed headset voice encoding technologies necessary to function in an area with high levels of background noise (firearms);  (5)  Indicate the availability of a cutoff switch for the microphone if an instructor wishes to remain off the air; (6)  Hands free operation, keeping any and all wires or cords to a minimum;  (7)  Voice-activated capable; (8)  Indicate the availability of weatherproofing for outdoor use in extreme conditions; (9)  Indicate availability of a desktop transceiver in the control center and how it will function with the proposed headset system; (10)  Provide detailed information on chargers, interchangeable battery clips, other accessories (e.g., antennas, replacement batteries, adjustable arm microphones, throat microphones, etc.) and thoughts on the effectiveness of various solutions; (11)  Identify any experience with providing these systems in a law enforcement firearms training environment (i.e., previous installations or product development); (12)  Provide list price rough-order-magnitude pricing including price adjustments for step sizes of orders; (13)  Provide typical repair and warranty information available for these units;  (14)  Identify any unique features that may add to the effectiveness of communicating within a firing range not specifically mentioned in this document.  All submissions will become the property of the U.S. Government and will not be returned. Any company “proprietary” or “confidential” information should be annotated as such.  Do not submit samples; FLETC will not guarantee the return of any samples provided, nor will FLETC pay for any samples provided and not returned.  Information should be provided to the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, Procurement, Bldg 93 (C. Doster), 1131 Chapel Crossing Road, Brunswick (Glynco), GA  31524.  Packages should be clearly marked as “Wireless Headset System Information” and be presented in such a manner as to ensure that the materials remain together securely to avoid separation of information during reviews.  Questions regarding technical information must be referred in writing to cynthia.doster@dhs.gov.  Verbal requests for technical information will not be accepted.

<CONTACT>Terri Corbett, 502-624-8069
<DESC>PRIVATIZATION OF NATURAL GAS UTILITY DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM, FORT KNOX KY DESCRIPTION:  The Government is seeking responsible potential sources interested in the privatization of the U.S. Army-owned natural gas distribution system at Fort Knox KY.  Fort Knox covers about 110,000 acres and is located 35 miles south of Louisville KY.  The installation is predominantly an area of exclusive Federal jurisdiction.   Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and operations and maintenance responsibilities, to include such items as environmental compliance, maintenance costs,  major system renovations and upgrades, construction, equipment and manpower, of the Government-owned distribution system to a municipal, private, regional, district or cooperative utility company or to another entity. Fort Knox currently receives natural gas supply from the spot market by an area-wide Defense Energy Services Center contract delivered through Louisville Gas & Electric to the Government-owned distribution system through two master-metered delivery points that are served from 6-inch to 8-inch high pressure transmission lines.  The Government-owned natural gas distribution system consists of about 100 miles of gas lines that range from less than 2 inches to 12 inches in diameter, 1800 building services and 9 00 main valves.  About 70 percent of the system consists of polyethylene pipe that was installed during the last 20 years to replace steel piping.  The steel piping which acounts for the remaining 30 percent of the system has an average age of 40 to 50 yea rs.  The system is in fairly good condition given its age and configuration.  Fort Knox is a weather-sensitive customer that consumes about 1,500,000 decatherms of natural gas annually. This request for information (RFI) is a component of a systematic process to implement the Department of Army's utilities privatization program.  Should insufficient credible interest or responsive capability be identified for a privatization action, it is  likely that no formal solicitation will be issued, otherwise, a formal request for proposals (RFP) may be forthcoming. The statement of interest submitted shall address all of the following general criteria, to include at a minimum: (1)	capability and experience in the ownership, operation, expansion and maintenance of similar retail or other Government service systems; (2)	financial capability to purchase, expand, maintain, and operate the utility system; (3)	a statement expressing a willingness and understanding of an obligation to provide continuous utility service; (4)	understanding of any applicable state or local utility law, capability of complying with such law and to initiate the service within a reasonable time after contract award; and (5)	understanding of the federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations; and familiarity and experience with environmental compliance procedures and regulations. A statement of interest should not exceed 15 pages in length.  Send statement of interest to the Directorate of Contracting, Attn: Steve Fries, Building 1109, Room 250, Fort Knox KY 40121-5000 no later than COB, local time, 02 April 2004.  Telephone calls will not be accepted.

<SUBJECT>R--Software Enhancement
<DESC>The Bureau of the Census, Geography Division, intends to enter into a sole source simplified acquisition with Traverse Technologies for enhancement, installation and testing of WebBAS software.  During 2003 a prototype system called "WebBAS" was developed as a prototype to support Web-based update of geospatial features in the Census Bureau's MAF/TIGER System by tribal, state and local governments as a complementary option for the current paper form and map based Boundary and Annexation Survey.  It is the belief of the Bureau of the Census that the developer of the software, Traverse Technologies, is the only vendor with experience in deploying a Census Bureau TIGER topological feature update application with survey control based upon two OGA specifications: the Web Map Service Specification and the Web Feature Service Specification.

Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the government.  In doing so, interested sources must submit, in writing,  technical capabilities, pricing, and other information that demonstrates their ability to meet the Census Bureau's needs within 15 days of this notice to linda.a.vance@census.gov or fax to 301-457-8465.  No telephone request will be honored.  No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice, but offers will be used to determine if a comparable source is available and more advantageous to the Bureau of the Census.  If no responses are received, a sole source contract with Traverse Technologies will be pursued without further notice.

<SUBJECT>A -- BAA04-06 Draft Statement  of Work Advanced Container Security Devices
<DESC>The objective of the HSARPA Advanced Container Security Device Program is to provide the next generation of maritime and inter-modal shipping container security devices with multiple sensing modalities, “smart” condition monitoring, automated alerting, and advanced communications.  DHS has a number of other initiatives in the container security area, including Operation Safe Commerce, the Container Security Initiative (CSI) and the Smart-Box Program, most of which have a focus on immediate deployment. This effort is intended to supplement those by taking a slightly longer design period to look ahead at the next generation of “smart” containers.

The proposed advanced container security devices must provide a quantum increase in the level of protection and assurance, including the breaching of the container through the sides, detection of certain prohibited cargoes, internal ambient conditions, manipulation or change of state of the contents, and the recording of a “smart” history of the container interactions.  The devices must survive the rigors of the marine and inter-modal transportation environments.  Despite these ambitious requirements, the advanced container security devices must be economical in manufacture so as to afford their widespread use.  Design to cost and manufacturing technologies are key drivers.

It is essential that the proper skill level of Pipefitter Workers be supplied for each individual order placed under the resulting contract.

The offeror(s) shall document their ability to supply Pipefitter Workers/Lead Pipefitter Workers in accordance with the Required Technical Qualifications set forth as follows:  Required Technical Qualifications – All Pipefitter Workers/Lead Pipefitter Workers provided must possess a basic knowledge of most phases of the trade including theory, hydraulics systems, practice, codes, and the proper and safe use of tools and equipments.

Proposal Preparation Instructions: Technical Proposal: The offeror shall submit a technical proposal that documents the marine qualifications, including brazing certificate requirement, of the Pipefitter Workers/Lead Pipefitter Workers that they commit to supply under any resulting contract.  A proposal that merely states that the workers will meet all the requirements of the solicitation may be determined technically unacceptable.    Any offer submitted shall include details of the types of experience, including marine experience, that will be supplied as Pipefitter Workers/Lead Pipefitter.  The proposal shall also include details that confirm that the offeror is capable of supplying, at a minimum two (2), and up to eight (8) qualified Marine Pipefitter Workers and a Lead Marine Pipefitter within six (6) days of receipt of a delivery order.    Past Performance: Offeror shall supply at least one (1) relevant marine shipyard recommendation for past performance evaluation purposes.

The Government estimates that there will be a need for approximately 1,380 hours (1,200 hrs/Pipefitter Workers, 180 hours Lead Pipefitter) of services required during the period of performance for this contract.  Estimated overtime for Pipefitter Workers is 200 hours and 30 hours for the Lead Pipefitter.  These are estimated hours only and are not a representation to an offeror or contractor that they will be required or ordered, or that conditions affecting requirements will be stable or normal.

On days of inclement weather, contractor shall call the Coast Guard Inclement Weather Hotline at (410) 636-7910, Option 1.  If the recording announces that the U.S. Coast Guard YARD is closed, contractor shall NOT report to the YARD and WILL NOT be compensated for that day.  In the event that the contractor reports to the YARD and is sent home (inclement weather, no work, etc.), contractor shall receive a minimum of two (2) hours compensation at the standard rate at which they are authorized under the agreement.   FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999) and the following addenda:  Proposal Evaluation: The Government will evaluate all offers to be qualified for award as follows: If it is determined in the best interest of the Government, the Government reserves the right to make more than one award in response to this solicitation.    The Government will review each proposal submitted in response to this solicitation and make award to the offeror who submits the best proposal for supplying personnel with the qualifications listed above.    The Government will consider price as a factor in the evaluation, but the contractor’s technical qualifications and capability to provide a number of Marine Pipefitter Workers are more important.    Past Performance information will also be considered but it is less important than price.   Technical is more important than price and past performance combined.   The experience will be evaluated for its relevancy and should be recent.    Marine shipyard experience is required.  Proposals not meeting this requirement may be determined unacceptable.  The evaluated price will be obtained by multiplying the estimated number of hours times the relevant labor category rate.    The two labor category totals will then be added together to achieve a final price for evaluation purposes.  The overtime rates will be multiplied by 200 for Pipefitter Workers and 30 for the Lead Pipefitter.  The totals for those two categories will then be added to the total for the straight time rate to achieve a final evaluated price.  Price evaluation will be performed by the Contracting Officer to determine the reasonableness of each proposed price and to determine the Offeror’s understanding of the work and ability to perform the contract.  The Government reserves the right to make an award without discussions.  This requirement will be awarded on an all or none basis.

The Flexible Engine Diagnostic System (FEDS) (military designator A/E37T-33) is designed for off-airframe testing of turboshaft engines at the intermediate maintenance level.  The FEDS at Fort Campbell, KY needs to be able to run the Rolls-Royce 250-C30R/3M used in the  A/MH-6M Mission Enhanced Little Bird in order to verify proper engine performance prior to installing the engine on aircraft.  The purpose of testing is to perform leak checks, vibration checks, and power checks to avoid installing engines on the aircraft  to perform these functions.  Modification of the FEDS to perform these tests will save time by avoiding unnecessary engine installations and removals.  The Contractor shall fabricate a control panel and harness for operation and monitoring of the RR250 C3 0R/3M engine on the FEDS.

The FEDS control cabin can provide both 28 VDC and 110 VAC (60 Hz) power.  The Contractor  shall support installation and checkout of the control on the FEDS at Fort Campbell for a total of two days.  The contractor shall provide installation drawings and a manual for the panel.

(vi)	Statement of Work

BACKGROUND
The ship’s service and control air compressors on the T-AO 187 Class vessels need to be replaced.  The Nash liquid ring rotary compressor units are inefficient to operate, costly to repair, and maintenance intensive.  MSC requires a replacement for the current models with a more efficient, more reliable type of air compressor that has an economically feasible preventative maintenance program.  The ship’s service air system requires clean, dry, oil-free air to serve various shops, whistles, atomizing, and tool hose services.  The control air system serves various pneumatically operated valves, main engine clutch control, shaft brake, and various control valves.  

EQUIPMENT REQUIREMENTS
MSC has performed an extensive evaluation of the various types of low pressure air compressors and air dryers and has determined that combined with avoiding extensive retrofitting of a new unit to the existing supply and service systems and overall performance requirements, the following requirements are necessary:

1.	Screw type air compressor unit
2.	200 scfm or greater at 125 psig
3.	Direct Drive
4.	Footprint limitations
a.	Length not to exceed 85 inches
b.	Width not to exceed 75 inches
c.	Height not to exceed 72 inches
5.	Weight not to exceed 5000lbs.
6.	No enclosure (Preferred)
7.	Foundation must include vibration isolation mounting.
8.	Air Dryer package rated at 125 psig for moisture/oil/contaminate separation to .1 micron downstream of Air Receivers.  Air Dryer shall be capable of drying 280 scfm of air to a -40 degF dewpoint at 100 psig and 100 degF.  Package shall be skid mounted and include all recommended prefilters, dryers, and after filters as necessary.  Package shall include dual elements for 100% redundancy, and provide automatic switching between elements in the event of element failure.  Automatic condensate draining from the filters shall be provided.
9.	Worldwide service/support locations, to include spare parts availability
10.	ABS/USCG approved 
11.	Air compressor units must  be fresh water cooled via integral or skid mounted fresh water heat exchanger.  
12.	Standard shipboard spare parts for 1 year of operation (2 sets per ship) to include:
a.	Oil separator
b.	Lubricating oil
c.	Air filter
d.	Oil filter
e.	Dryer Package filter element replacements, if applicable
13.	Lead/Lag operation (2 units) - Contractor’s air compressor controls shall mimic the current control logic onboard the T-AO class vessels as follows:
a.	A lead/lag control capability shall be integrated into the control panel of the air compressors.  Either compressor shall be capable of being selected as on-line or standby.
b.	Pressure switches and/or associated electrical controls furnished with control panel shall be set at the cut-in/cut-out pressures listed below.  

Pressure Switches		Cut-In			Cut out
On-line Compressor		115psig			125psig
Standby Compressor		110psig			120psig
14.	New air compressor units shall integrate/interface with the existing support systems:
a.	Ships service air system (200 scfm or greater at 125 psig) 
i.	(2) Air Receivers 50 cubic feet, relief valve set at 150 psig
ii.	Piping size from compressors to Air Receivers – 2 in.
iii.	Piping size from Air Receivers to compressor pressure switch – 1/2 in.
iv.	Piping size from Air Receivers to/from Dryer package – 2 in.
b.	Central Fresh Water system 
i.	Flow - 48 gpm 
ii.	FW supply and return piping size - 2 in 
iii.	Pressure – 150 psig

T-AO Solicitation N00033-04-Q-8000 Questions:		

·	Is the requirement for (2) 100 SCFM compressors or (2) 200 SCFM compressors?  Item 14a specs the Ship Service Air System at 200 SCFM.
Requirement is for 2 compressors at 200 scfm each.  Each needs to be capable of 100% of normal service.  
·	The dryer package to be installed downstream of the compressors is only to be rated at 280 CFM.  The air system description is for two compressors to be set up on a lead/lag system, which allows for both units to run at the same time for periods of time.  Is the dryer to handle the flow of both compressors?  
No.  As seen in the system drawings, the flow from the compressors goes to 2 air receivers in parallel.  When a second compressor is running, its purpose is to bump up the receiver pressure to system operating pressure.  The flow between the compressors and the receivers would then be 400 scfm.  When the receivers are at operating pressure, the designed flow from receivers to the dryers is 200 scfm.  Therefore, dryer should be sized for 200 scfm, 280 max.
·	If the compressors are 200 SCFM each, shouldn't the dryer be sized for the 400+ flow of both compressors?
See previous response.
·	Does the ship system take air for another usage prior to the dryer?
No, all air passes from the air receivers to the dryer before being distributed to the ship’s service air and control air systems.
·	Do the footprint dimensions, line 4, pertain to both compressors and the dryer combined, or do these dimensions apply to each compressor footprint?  Requirement 8 asks for the dryer package as a separate skid mounted item. 
Line 4 refers to the footprint limits of each compressor only.  
·	Does the weight on item 5 pertain to both the compressors and dryer combined or is that the weight of each compressor?
Line 5 refers to the weight limit of each compressor only.
·	What is the air usage requirement downstream of the dryer?  The dryer is asked to be capable of handling 280 SCFM, but this does not limit loses.  Is this an inlet flow or a discharge flow requirement?  
200 SCFM at 100 psig is the design operating inlet flow condition of the current dryer as originally designed. (280 SCFM max) Current desiccant dryer has 3-5 psig pressure loss.
·	Will membrane dehydrators be an acceptable alternative for a dual canister, desiccant dryer system?
If air quality requirements in RFQ are met, equipment will be acceptable.
·	For the ABS/USCG requirements, what are they?  Which ABS/USCG specs apply, and how do we get them?  Please supply a contact we could discuss the requirements with.
ABS Steel Vessel Rules 2004, Part 4, Vessel Systems and Machinery is available online at www.eagle.org .  Some specific ABS rules that apply include, but are not limited to, section 4-6-7/5.5, regarding control air, and section 4-4-1 may be applicable regarding the fresh water heat exchanger.  Requirements can be discussed further with ABS Americas, Alexandria office at 703-519-0801.
USCG Regulations are covered in Title 46 of the Code of Federal Regulations, available online at www.access.gpo.gov .
·	Do the compressors being offered, need to be ABS/USCG approved, in order for the solicitation offer to be considered?  Will compressors that are approved for U.S. Navy ship installation be acceptable alternatives for ABS approved?
The compressor models offered do not have to be pre-approved by ABS/USCG.  However, it must be capable of being approved by ABS upon submittal of unit specifications and a statement that the unit complies with an accepted standard (ANSI, ASME, etc.).  Final testing will also be witnessed by an ABS surveyor at installation.  Prior ABS approval greatly reduces the risk to the government.  U.S. Navy installation improves the government’s confidence in the shipboard application, but is not an alternative to ABS approval.  Note, ABS will review on behalf of the USCG.  
·	What are the ship's pitch and roll requirements for this application? 
Design angles of inclination for shipboard machinery, per ABS Steel Vessel Rules 2004 and 46 CFR are: Athwartship:  15 deg Static, 22.5 deg Dynamic.
Fore-and-Aft: 5 deg Static, 7.5 deg Dynamic.
·	For the central fresh water system on 14b, is 48 GPM flow available to each compressor package or is this the total flow available to be shared by both compressors?
48 GPM is the flow rate available to each compressor.
·	What constitutes a failure. If dew point is one of them then both dryers will need a dew point analyzer. We could do it with one analyzer but we would look at controlling both dryers with one PLC. That may not satisfy the "dual" nature of this request though. 
Dew point being out of spec would constitute a failure.  One analyzer and one controller for two separate dryer elements would satisfy the redundancy requirement.
·	For the dryer, is there any preference for a heated vs. a non-heater dryer?
Preference is for components with less complexity, electrical load, and maintenance burden that meet the requirements of the RFQ. 
·	Are both stainless steel and painted carbon steel acceptable materials for the dryer?
Yes, both are acceptable materials.
·	AIR DRYER PACKAGE:  The "requirements" show dual prefilters and dual afterfilters with "automatic" switching upon element failure.  The standard will be manual valve bypasses.  Element failure means 0 psi drop to me.  But what happens if pressure drop increases above 1-psi?  Also, I noticed on the drawing that the wording says (air dryers, #1&2).  I am assuming that this = one desiccant dryer package with 2 towers? 
The requirements state that the main dryer must have dual elements with automatic switching between the two.  A dessicant dryer with two towers fulfills this requirement.  The total number of prefilters and afterfilters is left to the bidder, so as not to limit the manufacturer's best engineering design and recommendation for the best operation of the system.  If dual prefilters and after filters are used, manual switching between filters is sufficient.  If a single prefilter and single after filter is used, manual bypass valves around the filters are sufficient.  On the existing system diagram provided as GPI, air dryers, #1&2 refers to one desiccant dryer package with 2 towers.
·	OPERATING TEMP:  Temp range is specified as 32F to 120F.  The standard package will go to 115F.  Will this be OK?
The operating temperature requirement is 32F to 120F.  The high end cannot be comprimised, as this temperature is often reached during operation.  A lower temperature rating could result in lower capacity and increased maintenance.
·	ABS/USCG Approved:  We have installed standard product via MSC in VA on-board vessels (as well as other marine applications).  I am not sure how your guys "dealt" with this approval.  Will standard product be OK or will it need to go through ABS/USCG approval??
The product and system as a whole must have the ability to be ABS/USCG approved.  There are specific requirements for control air located in ABS Rules 2004, but the compressor unit itself does not have to be Type Approved.  If similar products from a manufacturer were installed by MSC in the past, then the government has high confidence in ABS approval of this system with that manufacturer's products.
NOTE:  DATE & TIME OF SUBMISSION CHANGE
Offers are due by 1200 hours local time, Friday, 19 March 2004.  Proposals may be submitted via fax (202-685-5965) or email (Elyssa.Parana@navy.mil).

Questions/Answers

Question 16.  Would you consider using MS Access instead of Word or Notepad? Reason being is that Access is a database which will allow search capabilities and it has an awesome reporting structure.  This would be very useful when downloading data and formulating results.

Answer:  Word or Notepad were given as examples, it’s the offer’s choice on what software is sufficient.

Question 17.  During the Pilot Phase will real candidates be using the system and testing it’s use as part of the vacancy announcement/candidates screening.

Answer:  No, it is not intended for real candidates to be using the system during the pilot phase.

Question 18.  Item #5 indicates Program Review approximately 165 days after contract award. Could you please tell me what you envision the phase to be?

Answer:  165 days after the award of the contract there will be a Program Review of the contract project of the program.

Question 19.  When is the designated award date?

Answer:  There isn’t a date set, after the Government has reviewed proposals and has decided who has the offer.

Question 20. What is meant by “it is anticipated the requirement is for a minimum of five years.”  Are you saying the contract is for 5 years, you’ll only use the new methodology for 5 years, or what is that in reference to?

Answer:  The contract will be for five years (Base and 4 option years)

Question 21.  Will I be required to travel to Arlington more than 2 times during the course of the project?

Answer:  Frequency of travel to Arlington will depend upon the contractor’s understanding of the project and amount of on-site discussions needed.

Question 22.  How long will the vendor be expected to host the site?  Only through the Pilot program or beyond?

Answer:  It is expected that the vendor will host the Site during the pilot and beyond.  Possibly each time the Announcement is opened whether that’s two or three per year with the possibility that Announcement might be opened on a continuous basis.
