<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to negotiate on a sole source basis under authority of FAR 6.302 with University of Arizona Health Sciences Library (UAHSL), Tucson, Arizona to offer two (2) internships in health sciences librarianship to Hispanic and/or Native American students accepted in the Knowledge River Institute program.  These internships will promote NLM’s mission to provide support for medical library development and for training of biomedical librarians.  The period of performance shall be for a ten (10) month period.

Specifically, UAHSL will offer two (2) internships that will provide grounding in health sciences librarianship practice.  UAHSL will provide a positive exposure to health sciences librarianship by exposing the interns to the variety inherent in the health sciences environment and by providing collegial support as they learn to deal with possible daunting medical information requests.  All interns will receive an orientation to each department at UAHSL.  Interns will then work with staff to create a program focusing on reference, outreach, library systems, access or collections services as needed for the academic year.  UAHSL shall also sponsor attendance at a regional or national meeting of the Medical Library Association (MLA).  UAHSL shall provide a member of the UAHSL faculty to serve as a mentor at the meeting.

The NLM determined that UAHSL is uniquely qualified to provide the internships.  The University has a unique program, the Knowledge River Institute, that focuses on library and information issues from the needs and perspectives of Hispanics and Native Americans.  The Knowledge River Institute is concerned with the special interests and needs of Native Americans and Hispanics as graduate students and as the focus of many new specialized courses leading to an MA in Library Science and Information Resources.  This is the only library school in the U.S. with such a program focusing specifically on graduate students from Hispanic and Native American cultures.  

This service will be procured under FAR Part 13 (Simplified Acquisitions.)  This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all responsible and responsive sources may submit a proposal that will be considered by the NLM.  Firms/Individuals interested in responding to this synopsis must be able to provide the professional services as specified above.  Responses should demonstrate the firm/individual’s ability to meet the government’s requirements.  Responses are required within 15 (fifteen) calendar days from the publication date of this synopsis.  NLM synopsis No. 03-202/NSD shall be noted on all correspondence to this synopsis.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for the upgrade of an existing Datamax II Instrumentation Recorder. NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from RC Electronics who is the only known responsible source that can meet Agency requirements. The existing NASA owned instrumentation recorder was constructed by RC Electronics.	As such, the company is thoroughly familiar with the sytem architecture and is the only company with access to the proprietary hardware and software components incorporated into the system.  It would involve significant additional Government expense and time to retrofit the current system with alternate vendor hardware, and these costs are not expected to be recovered through competition. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on August 28, 2003.

<DESC>UT-Battelle, LLC, (the "Company"), acting under its Prime Contract No. DE-AC05-00OR22725 with the United States Department of Energy (DOE), for management and operation of Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), is requesting an Expression Of Interest (EOI) from prospective vendors to provide support in the research and development efforts of fuel cell and advanced vehicle power electronics and machinery applications.  This EOI serves as a method of identifying potential vendors; and is being offered on behalf of the Department of Energy's Office of FreedomCAR and Vehicle Technologies.  

To achieve the goal of increasing vehicle fuel economy while maintaining cost targets, future power electronics must meet the following requirements:  reductions in size, weight, and manufacturing costs.  Additionally, reliable operation and improvements in efficiency under increased temperatures and rugged environmental conditions must be achieved.  New technological advances must be initiated to realize these objectives.  Innovative designs and manufacturing methods must be pioneered to take power electronics to the "next level" while maintaining cost goals.  

The Department of Energy's Office of FreedomCAR and Vehicle Technologies is offering this EOI to foster technologies to reduce a growing dependency on oil and continually elevating pollution levels.  It is being issued in close coordination with the domestic automotive industry with the goal of developing and demonstrating significant technological advancements at low production costs.  It is broken into two subtopics for consideration.  

A.	SUBTOPIC I

The ORNL specification will outline the functional and performance requirements for a System on a Chip (SoC) motor controller for use in a broad range of applications such as hybrid and fuel cell-based vehicles.  

Today's motor controller technology revolves around commercially available digital signal processors (DSPs). These chips are able to perform the complicated high-speed mathematical functions necessary for motor control.  In some cases, DSP manufacturers have included additional circuitry within the chip, specifically for use in control applications.  However, external circuitry is still required to accomplish all the functions necessary for efficient motor control.  This specification outlines the functional and performance requirements for a traction motor controller SoC.  The proposed architecture is intended to achieve cost reduction through the integration of functions and inclusion of necessary external circuitry within a single semiconductor device.  Additionally, cost reduction will be realized by the development of a flexible modular control system suitable for use with drive systems of varying power levels.

Through the reduction in parts count and manufacturing efforts, it is hoped a cost reduction of 40 to 60% of a conventional controller board can be realized in high volume production.  
It is anticipated that this project will be separated into two phases.  Phase I will involve a detailed cost study and analysis of potential processes and packaging methods to meet the specific requirements of a Statement of Work.  Technological innovations will be highly encouraged.  A detailed development plan, power budget, and cost analysis for production quantities of 100,000, 500,000 and 1,000,000 must be presented.  A viable path to commercialization along with a schedule must be included.  A comprehensive report on all activities and accomplishments made during Phase I will be delivered to ORNL. A proposed schedule of the development effort will be established along with major milestones.  

The second phase of the project will involve the design, simulation, and synthesis of the chip.   It is anticipated that these awards may support efforts for a project period of up to two years.

B)	SUBTOPIC II

This ORNL specification will outline the functional and performance requirements for a high voltage to isolated, DC-to-DC converter for use in hybrid and fuel cell based vehicles.    It is a requirement that the converter be designed and fabricated with a baseline 14V output capable of supplying 5kW.  An additional 42V output is a highly desirable option, and its inclusion in the proposal is at the discretion of the Seller(s). For the dual output converter (42V/14V) the 14V power requirement shall be 3kW and the 42V output shall be capable of supplying 5kW.    The SOW will detail the requirements for both 14V and 42V converter outputs.  

The Seller will design and fabricate an isolated DC-to-DC converter per the specifications. A detailed cost analysis will be performed by the Seller discussing design trade offs with cost considerations.  The cost study will identify any critical or key costing issues.  The study shall include projections of costs for annual production volumes of 100,000, 500,000, and 1,000,000 units.  A viable path to production must be demonstrated.  A cost objective of $75/kW has been targeted with volume and weight goals of 5 liters and 6 kg, respectively.  Technical barriers will be discussed with potential solutions.  Any issues concerning the use of the proposed technology relevant to a vehicle application will be identified.  The design will take into account an expected lifetime of 15 years or 150,000 miles.   A minimum of four (4) packaged converters will be delivered at the conclusion of the project to ORNL for evaluation.  The testing of the deliverable hardware will be undertaken to validate the design and verify readiness for use in a vehicle.    It is anticipated that this project will last up to three years. 

The intent of this EOI is to identify prospective vendors who can provide this support in the research and development efforts of fuel cell and advanced vehicle power electronics and machinery applications.  Teaming arrangements are acceptable.  Once viability of subcontracting part or all of this scope is determined by ORNL, a detailed RFP will be issued for the scope to be subcontracted, including specific qualification requirements.  Please provide your EOI submittal to Christine M. Sullivan by e-mail (sullivancm@ornl.gov) or fax (865) 241-2426 by close of business March 20, 2003.

<DESC>NA USACECOM and PM, WIN-T are anticipating issuing a Best Value Competitive Request for Proposal (RFP).  The RFP Number for this acquisition is DAAB07-03-R-E808 and it provides for the acquisition of the System Development and Demonstration (SDD), Spiral 1 Li mited Production and Spiral 2 Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP), of the Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) Cluster 5 Radio Sets.  The proposed contract types are as follows:  SDD Phase is Cost Reimbursement type, Time and Material contract line for Contra ctor Support Services for the JTRS Cluster 5, Firm-Fixed Price for the limited Production for Spiral 1, and Firm-Fixed Price with Successive Targets for the Low Rate Initial Production of Spiral 2. The PM is employing a performance approach for the acquisi tion of the JTRS Cluster 5 Radio Sets. Offerors shall propose a best value approach based on solicitation requirements as annotated under the Statement of Work and the Performance Requirement Specification and Appendices that will be posted with the solici tation package. Additionally, the PM will identify a minimum set of schedule parameters to which the contractor must adhere.  The contractor will propose discrete milestones within those parameters.  It is proposed that the evolutionary development and dem onstration of the JTRS Cluster 5 Radio Sets will involve the development of the Spiral 1 Single Channel Handheld (HH) and Two Channel Manpack (MP), and the Spiral 2 Two Channel Handheld (HH), Two Channel Manpack (MP), and the nine various form factors of t he Spiral 2 Small Form Fit (SFF). The first spiral satisfies a critical and urgent Joint Warfighter requirement by modifying Commercial Off The Shelf/Non Developmental Items (COTS/NDI) and porting available waveforms.  A second spiral provides expanded cap ability, ports additional waveforms, and fully complies with requirements of the JTRS ORD, Version 3.2.  Information on the waveforms associated with each of the form factors by spiral will be provided with the solicitation package.  All JTRS Cluster 5 ass ets, including Spiral 1 and Spiral 2, will be SCA compliant. The estimated range quantities to be acquired are as follows: Spiral 1 Handheld (HH) approximate range quantities of 3,000 to 5,000, 5,001 to 7,000, 7,001 to 10,000; Spiral 1 Manpack (MP) approxi mate range quantities of 1,500 to 2,000, 2,001 to 2,500, 2,501 to 3,000; Spiral 2 Handheld (HH) to range quantities of 2,000 to 3,000, 3,001 to 4,000, 4,001 to 5,000; Spiral 2 Manpack (MP) range quantities of 7,000 to 7,750, 7,751 to 8,750, 8,751 to 9,750;  Spiral 2 Small Form Fit (SFF) 3,000 to 3,750, 3,751 to 4,750, 4,751 to 5,750.  This acquisition also includes currently undefined quantities of AKits, Accessories, and Ancillary Items (Batteries, Interface Cables, Power Cables, Antennas, and Mounting Brac kets for the Manpack).  Delivery Points are to be determined. All parties interested in doing business with USACECOM are invited to access, operate, send and receive information from the Army Single Face to Industry Interactive Business Opportunities Page (ASFI IBOP)at http://abop.monmouth.army.mil.

<CONTACT>MARGARET RHINESMITH, BUSINESS SPECIALIST, (973)724-3050
<DESC>The U. S. TACOM-ARDEC intends to award a sole source purchase order to Oryx Systems, Inc., 9313K Monroe Road, Charlotte, North Carolina 28270 for  developing ammunition containers that are made from sheet metal with scores to  be stamped into the sheet metal on both the top and bottom surfaces.  ARDEC is  soliciting a laser thickness measurement system that measures the shortest  distance between the top and bottom scores.  The system shall consist of a  laser head mount, two laser heads, and supporting hardware and software for  accurate measurement output.  The laser system shall be capable of measuring a  sheet up to 1/16 inch (one-sixteenth inch) thick.  The shortest distance  between the two scores will vary between 0.005 to 0.013 inch (five-thousandth  to thirteen thousandth inch).  The top / bottom scores are not perfectly  aligned on top of one another, but the scores may be offset up to 0.002 in.  (two-thousandth inch) in the horizontal direction. To measure true shortest  distance between the two offset scores, the laser heads shall be able to scan  across the score by moving on the mount either manually or with  electrical/mechanical assistance.  The laser heads shall measure top/bottom  score depths in the vertical direction while scanning horizontally across the  score. The laser system shall be capable of displaying and storing the score  thickness measurements by means of special hardware that interfaces with a  standard computer.  The computer shall be capable of displaying the true  shortest distance with minimal human interaction.  Each individual score  thickness measurement shall not take more than 10 seconds (ten seconds) between positioning the system to completing a measurement.  Prior to  acceptance, the contractor shall demonstrate to government representatives that  the laser system can inspect and calculate the shortest distance between the  two scores with an accuracy of +/- 0.0002” (two ten-thousandth inch).  The  contractor shall deliver the laser system to TACOM-ARDEC four (4) weeks after  the contract award.  The authority for this action is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1)–   Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy  agency requirements, as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii).  Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract.  See Number Note 22.

<DESC>The 15th Contracting Squadron (15 CONS), Hickam AFB Hawaii, intends to award a competitive Small Business 8(a) set-aside contract. This effort will be awarded as a Firm-Fixed Price contract with a one-year base period and four one-year option periods. The base period of this contract is projected to begin on 01 January 2004. A Solicitation will be posted on or about 28 June 2003. The Hickam AFB LAN, MAN, and WAN supports HQ PACAF and the 15th Air Base Wing totaling over 6,000 users.  The majority of Hickam network communications are accomplished over Non-Secure IP Router Network (NIPRNET) and the Secure IP Router Network (SIPRNET). The major communications systems making up the operational network within HQ PACAF can be broken into file, print, messaging, TCP/IP, and management services.  File servers provide users with network accessible data storage space for both personal uses and for information dissemination.  Print services allow for the sharing of print devices among users in the office or the entire network.  Print sharing permits the amortization of a more expensive, high speed, quality printer over many users.  Messaging is the most used and critical service on the network, and is combined with appointment and tasking applications.  TCP/IP Services include web, net news, file transfer, and remote terminal access applications.  All PACAF EOR bases supported by the NOSC have similar operations, although these vary in size between 1,000 and 7,000 users at each location.  There are over 40,000 users in the PACAF EOR. Funds are not currently available for this acquisition; therefore, the solicitation will be issued under FAR clause 52.232-18, Availability of Funds. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541512 ($21 million). Once available, this solicitation must be downloaded from http://www.eps.gov, as NO paper copies will be issued. All information required for submission of an offer will be identified in the solicitation. The government contemplates award on or about 01 October 2003, with a performance start date of 01 January 2004.  The successful Offeror will be required to have a Top-Secret Clearance. This notice serves as preliminary information and does not obligate the government to award a contract, restrict the government in its ultimate acquisition approach, or obligate the government to pay for proposal cost. The “DRAFT” Statement of Work (SOW) is attached for industry comments. For any questions/comments please contact (via e-mail preferred) the POC listed below.

The new term _Evergreen Contracting_ option periods has been added to this Solicitation.  Evergreen contracts provides new policies and procedures to expand the multiyear contracts for all Multiple Award Schedules (MAS)  Federal Supply Schedules to one 5 year basic contract period and three separate 5 year option periods. The Contracting Officer may exercise the option to extend the contract for an additional three five (5) years, by providing a written notice to the contractor at least 150 days in advance prior to the expiration of the contract period.  When the Government exercises its option to extend the term of this contract, option prices must be determined fair and reasonable  at the time the option is exercised.  The Contracting Officer will obtain a contractor statement that the basis of award customer/Most Favored Customer (MFC) has remained the same and that pricing information provided to negotiate the contract, as updated through any modifications, has not changed unless an adjustment is made in accordance with another contract clause (e.g., Economic Price Adjustment Clause or Price Reduction Clause).  Current contractors are not required to submit an offer under this solicitation issuance.  Contracts awarded under this solicitation will have a contract period beginning on the date of award and will last for a five (5) year period, unless extended under the Evergreen option period, canceled or terminated.  

All vendors and/current contractors should be aware that the Evergreen Contracting option period cannot be exercised if your electronic catalog has not been approved and posted on GSA Advantage. This solicitation has been prepared in accordance with FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, which implements Title VIII of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (FASA) of 1994 (Public Law 103-355), the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-106), and the final rule, published as General Services Administration Acquisition Regulation (GSAR) Change 76, regarding commercial item acquisitions under the Multiple Award Schedule Program.  The contract format and data requirements in this solicitation differ from previous solicitations.  Offerors are strongly encouraged to carefully review the entire solicitation package before submission to ensure compliance with commercial item provisions.  Contractors are now required to accept the Government purchase card for payments equal to or less than the micro-purchase threshold for oral and written delivery orders.  Contractors are encouraged to accept the Government purchase card for payment for orders above the micro-purchase threshold.  See GSAR Clause 552.232.77, entitled _Purchase by Credit Card_.  This solicitation contains the new clause _Contractor_s Report of Sales_ (552.238-74), which requires the submission of sales on electronic GSA Form 72A via the Internet and _Industrial Funding Fee_ (552.238-76), which requires a 1% due on a calendar quarter schedule.  Offerors must include the IFF in their prices.  The fee is included in the award price(s) and reflected in the total amount charged to ordering activities.  GSA has established a contract sales criterion for all Multiple Award Schedules.  Clause I-FSS-639, entitled _Contract Sales Criteria_, states that a contract will not be awarded if the anticipated sales are not expected to exceed $25,000.  Contracts will also be canceled unless reported sales for each 12-month period from date of award are $25,000 and above.  This Federal Supply Schedule will no longer have a prescribed beginning and ending date.  The schedule period will be continuous, and will contain contracts with contract periods that commence on the date of award (DOA) and expire five years (exclusion of any options) from the DOA.  Unless otherwise noted in the solicitation, new offers may be forwarded at any time.  All requests for a diskette or hard copy of the solicitation should be faxed to (703) 305-5537, Attention: Ms. Dena Gross.

Pre-proposal conferences for Phase I will be held in Fort Worth, TX, San Antonio, TX, and New Orleans, LA. The pre-proposal conference for Fort Worth, TX is tentatively scheduled for March 4, 1999, at the Fritz G.

Technical ability is more important than price.  The Government intends to award up to 75% to small businesses in Category A (construction).  The Government may or may not hold discussions on technical proposals (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)) therefore, the offeror's initial proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a technical standpoint.  The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. The number of offerors included in the competitive range can be limited for purposes of efficiency. The number of proposals in the competitive range may be limited to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.  Offerors will not be reimbursed for Phase I or Phase II proposal submittal expenses.  The Government is not limited to contacting only those references provided by the offeror (s).  The Government may also consider the offeror's performance on contracts not submitted by the offeror that the Government is aware of, or becomes aware of.

The project must have involved repairs and alterations or new construction of federal, state, or municipal, roadways and/or elevated highways with construction costs at $10,000 or greater.  QUALITY is defined as meeting or exceeding the customers' requirements in a timely manner within established budgets as set forth in the construction contract documents.  Technical Evaluation Factors for each category proposing:  In Phase I, evaluation of technical factors will be accomplished by the Government's critical analysis of each contractor's proposal.

<DESC>NA The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, Coastal Systems Station, Panama City, Florida intends to issue a sole source purchase order to U.S. Divers/Aqualung America for the procurement of one (1)rebreather.  The rebreather design is based on the existing CRABE rebreather with some modifications to make it more suitable for U.S. Navy use.  The rebreather has been developed for a unique application that combines closed circuit, pure oxygen rebreather technology with semi-closed mixed gas rebreather technology using a respiratory linked system.  It can be used on pure oxygen in the closed circuit mode while the diver is near the surface and will not exhaust bubbles into the water column.  If the diver needs to go to greater depth, there is a switch, which changes the rebreather into a semi-closed respiratory linked system injecting mixed gas at a rate proportional to t he respiration rate of the diver.  The primary advantage of having the make up gas linked to the diver’s respiration is that the PPO2 in the system is stable at each depth and the gas is used more efficiently.  This rebreather, provided by Aqualung America, is the only rebreather in existence that incorporates all the features needed. Delivery will be to the Coastal Systems Station, 6703 W. Highway 98, Panama City, Fl 32407-7001. NAICS Code 332721 applies. SBA size standard is 500 employees. FSC is 4220.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) on behalf of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), Mouse Imaging Facility (MIF) intends on entering into a sole source contract with Visualsonics, 69 Yonge Street, Suite 302, Ontario, Canada M5E1K3 for the purchase of a 30-MHz RMV scanhead and integrated needle injection apparatus for the Vevo 660.  The MIF began operation in 1999 and is a shared resource that provides state-of-art equipment resources for research in development and application of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS), X-rays computed tomography, bioluminescence, ultrasound and provide technical and material support for research in the In Vivo NMR Research Center.  The 30 MHZ RMV scanhead is required due to its unique design to generate high resolution ultrasound images of research mice and rats.     The MIF currently owns a 40-MHz scanhead which offers extremely high resolution (50µm), but offers a small focal length and field of view (6mm), which is ideal for imaging very small objects, but, functions are limited by its small field of view.  The purchase of a 30-MHz scanhead would generate high resolution images (70µm), and provide the added benefit of a larger focal length (12.7mm).  The larger field of view will permit the MIF ultrasound imaging of larger objects (ie: adult mouse heart) and ultimately increase the quality of the entire imaging data set.  The Visualsonics Vevo 660 system is composed of proprietary hardware and software.  The integrated needle injection apparatus is specially designed to be integrated with the existing Visualsonics ultrasound equipment within the MIF.  The added apparatus will enhance the MIF ability to use ultrasound guidance to visually direct needle injections into microscopic targets.  Visualsonics are the only source known to the government which can provide the necessary equipment that is compatible with existing government-owned equipment.  However, if any interested party believes it can provide the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:30 P.M. EDT, (local Washington, D.C. time) on August 25, 2003.  This procurement will be processed based on the FAR 12 acquisition of commercial items.  If you have any questions please contact Cynthia Brown, Purchasing Agent on (301) 402-4509.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  The NAICS Code 334516

<DESC>NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) intends to contract with the European Space Agency/Centre National D'etudes Spatiales (CNES) on a sole source basis for remote ground station network pre-launch and launch support for the DELTA/SWIFT mission.  The DELTA/SWIFT mission requires spacecraft tracking over West Africa during the critical second engine start and cut-off event during the launch assent phase.  ESA/CNES is the only entity that can provide the required tracking and network support.  The SWIFT mission, launching on a Delta II 7320-10 vehicle, will require telemetry coverage during the launch window from December 5, 2003 to approximately the end of January 2004 from the CNES/CSG telemetry station in Libreville, Gabon (West Africa).  Support will commence at approximately launch minus 3.5 hours and extend through approximately launch plus 2 hours.	Actual antenna support is projected to be for approximately ½ hour from Acquisition of Signal to loss of signal during ascent phase of the SWIFT.	 Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c ) (1)-Only One Responsible Source.   This acquisition will utilize simplified acquisition procedures.   The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on 8/28/2003. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.   An Ombudsman has been appointed.

If the impact, be it positive or negative, is significant, the agencies are then required to prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis, which includes consideration of alternatives that are either less burdensome or more beneficial to the affected small entities.  In lieu of preparing an initial or final regulatory flexibility analysis, an agency head may certify the proposed regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities and publish with the certification the factual basis in support of that determination.  The total amount budgeted for this effort is $250,000.00 over a three year period.  This requirement is a 100% Small Business Set aside for small business concerns.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The purpose of this Modification to the Previous Notice is to correct the date of the Solictation posting date.  The date is hereby changed 28 June 2003 to 28 July 2003.  The text is hereby changed to read as follows:  The 15th Contracting Squadron (15 CONS), Hickam AFB Hawaii, intends to award a competitive Small Business 8(a) set-aside contract. This effort will be awarded as a Firm-Fixed Price contract with a one-year base period and four one-year option periods. The base period of this contract is projected to begin on 01 January 2004. A Solicitation will be posted on or about 28 July 2003. The Hickam AFB LAN, MAN, and WAN supports HQ PACAF and the 15th Air Base Wing totaling over 6,000 users.  The majority of Hickam network communications are accomplished over Non-Secure IP Router Network (NIPRNET) and the Secure IP Router Network (SIPRNET). The major communications systems making up the operational network within HQ PACAF can be broken into file, print, messaging, TCP/IP, and management services.  File servers provide users with network accessible data storage space for both personal uses and for information dissemination.  Print services allow for the sharing of print devices among users in the office or the entire network.  Print sharing permits the amortization of a more expensive, high speed, quality printer over many users.  Messaging is the most used and critical service on the network, and is combined with appointment and tasking applications.  TCP/IP Services include web, net news, file transfer, and remote terminal access applications.  All PACAF EOR bases supported by the NOSC have similar operations, although these vary in size between 1,000 and 7,000 users at each location.  There are over 40,000 users in the PACAF EOR. Funds are not currently available for this acquisition; therefore, the solicitation will be issued under FAR clause 52.232-18, Availability of Funds. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541512 ($21 million). Once available, this solicitation must be downloaded from http://www.eps.gov, as NO paper copies will be issued. All information required for submission of an offer will be identified in the solicitation. The government contemplates award on or about 01 October 2003, with a performance start date of 01 January 2004.  The successful Offeror will be required to have a Top-Secret Clearance. This notice serves as preliminary information and does not obligate the government to award a contract, restrict the government in its ultimate acquisition approach, or obligate the government to pay for proposal cost. The “DRAFT” Statement of Work (SOW) is attached for industry comments. For any questions/comments please contact (via e-mail preferred) the POC listed below.

<DESC>CORRECTION: DELETE MANAGEMENT APPROACH FROM THE FACTORS TO BE EVALUATED. ALL OTHER INFORMATION IN THE SYNOPSIS OR DESCRIPTION REMAINS UNCHANGED. 

THIS SOLICITATION IS HEREBY BEING ISSUED ON AN UNRESTRICTED BASIS INVITING FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION. The NAICS Code is 238210: Electrical Contractors. The Small Business Size is $12,000,000. Currently, Naval Air Station Corpus Christi receives its main distribution power from Central Power and Light (CP&L). CP&L owns and maintains the main sub-station located east of the main gate to NAS. The power is metered at the substation and fed through five underground circuit feeders and two overhead circuits. The distribution system was constructed in 1941. Wood utility poles have an average age of twenty-five years. Pad and pole mounted transformers and air switches are corroded, obsolete and deteriorated beyond repair. Emergency repairs were completed recently to underground feeder 4 due to splices failure. The system has surpassed its useful life and needs to be replaced. The project will provide general repairs to primary Electrical Distribution System at NAS Corpus Christi in order to meet current mission requirements. Generally speaking, the repairs will replace an aged, obsolete and unreliable electrical distribution system. More specifically, the work includes removing underground medium voltage cables, pole top switches, padmounted switches, and padmounted transformers; and providing new underground medium voltage cables, concrete encased duct banks, panelboards, pole top switches, padmounted switches, padmounted sectionalizing cabinets, and padmounted transformers.  The work also includes reconnection to existing electrical utilities, testing, and incidental related work. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsive/responsible proposer whose proposal conforming to the solicitation will be the BEST VALUE to the Government, price and technical factors considered. Proposers will be evaluated on Past Performance, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, Technical Qualifications, Technical Approach and Management Approach. The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all proposers; use of tradeoff process when it may be in the best interest of the Government to consider award to other than the lowest priced proposers or other than the highest technically rated proposer; and to award to the proposer submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous BEST VALUE to the Government. PROPOSERS ARE ADVISED THAT THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO EVALUATE PROPOSALS AND AWARD WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED. Therefore, proposals should be submitted initially on the most FAVORABLE terms. Proposers should not assume they would be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals. FIRMS SUBMITTING TECHNICAL AND PRICE PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE COMPENSATED FOR SPECIFICATIONS. The Government is issuing the RFP approximately 11 AUGUST 2003 with a closing date of 12 SEPTEMBER 2003 at 3:00PM (EDT). The solicitation will be placed on the WEB site only. The entire solicitation, including any plans and specifications, will be available for viewing and downloading at http://esol.navfac.navy.mil. A pre-proposal conference/site visit will be announced at http://esol.navfac.navy.mil. Prospective Offerors MUST register on the website. The official plan holders list will be maintained and can be printed from the website. Amendments will be posted on the website for downloading. This will normally be the ONLY method of distributing Amendments. Therefore, it is the offeror's responsibility to check the website periodically for any Amendments to this solicitation.

<DESC>The purpose of this contract is to secure 3 years of service for maintenance on aspen fences already constructed within the Scott Able Wildfire area for aspen stand protection.  This will require monthly maintenance to occur on each of the 12 exclosures from March through September for a total of 7 months annually for three years.  This is approximately 3 to 4 miles of fence.  To accomplish this, it is necessary to cut down trees that fall on the fence line and remove hazard trees that may fall on the existing fence line and maintain existing constructed fences.   The government will only supply/furnish the Tenax C-Flex polyethylene net fencing material needed for fence maintenance.  The contractor will furnish all other materials needed to maintain the aspen fences.  These materials include 8’ “T” Metal Posts, 12 ½ gage smooth twisted wire, 16 gage tie wire, staples, flagging, fence clips and any other material needed to maintain these 12 exclosures that can be purchased locally.  All materials that are replaced will be removed and disposed of.  This will be set aside for a small business.  The New Mexico Gross Receipts Tax will apply.  The service Contract Act will apply.  NAIC will be 234110.  Contact Cesar 505-434-7341.  Technical questions can be addressed to PJ Haenelt 505-682-2551.

<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Munitions Directorate, Ordnance Division, Energetic Materials Branch (MNME) seeks commercial quotations for a highly-specialized pulsed-laser spectroscopic diagnostic system.  The following paragraphs explain the minimum technical specifications/requirements for the tunable excitation laser component of this system, consisting of a Nd:YAG pump laser and a wavelength-tunable Optical Parametric Oscillator (OPO).  

Basic Configuration:  In this paragraph, system components to be provided by the vendor are discussed. Those to be provided by AFRL/MNME are identified as “government furnished equipment (GFE).”  The GFE will not be made available to the vendor for testing.  The output of a Nd:YAG pump laser will be used to drive a wavelength-tunable Optical Parametric Oscillator (OPO) with both items residing on an optical table (GFE).  Vendor will provide any internal or external beam steering optics required to redirect the Nd:YAG output for a secondary function (relay imaging focusing onto a target; these relay imaging optics and the target are GFE) without mechanical displacement of either the Nd:YAG pump laser or the OPO.  Sufficient internal or external beam dumps will be provided for safe operation of the system.  Vendor will supply any interface computer card required for communication between the laser system’s electronic control unit and an IBM-compatible personal computer (GFE).  This computer will run a Windows 2000 compatible software package to control the function of, and collect output wavelength and other performance data from the laser system.  The system will include all power supplies, power cables, and control cables required for operation with any combination of the following electrical services:  208 VAC three phase, 30 amp, 60 Hz; 240 VAC single phase, 40 amp, 60 Hz; 110 VAC single phase, 20 amp, 60 Hz operation.  

Mechanical Dimensions:  Vendor will include a mechanical sketch of the entire system with correct external dimensions and relative component placements in their quotation.  The Nd:YAG laser, OPO, and beam steering optics must fit onto a 4 foot x 10 foot section of the optical table.  Free space within this 4x10 foot section will be reserved for the GFE relay imaging optical system, which is proposed to occupy a 6 inch wide by 12 inch tall corridor extending straight out along the Nd:YAG fundamental output port; functionally equivalent alternative placements of these relay imaging optics proposed by the Vendor will also be considered.  Due to extreme lab space limitations smaller power supplies (shorter than 30 inches) capable of fitting underneath the optical table are desirable.  

Anticipated Environmental Variations:  The laser system will be required to operate in a laboratory environment with poor temperature and humidity control.  Typical temperature variations during working hours can cover a 6 degree Celcius (°C) range, with occasional variations over a 10 °C range also possible.  Vendor will clearly state the temperature ranges over which the following System Performance and Warranty requirements will be met.  Vendor is invited to describe any special design or manufacturing considerations for their system which may mitigate against potential problems caused by the anticipated environmental variations.  

System Performance:  Vendor will provide “typical” test data from previously manufactured laser systems for all of the following technical requirements for the purpose of source selection.  Vendor will provide actual test data from the laser system built for AFRL/MNME for all of the following performance requirements as a deliverable.  The Nd:YAG laser will operate at 10 Hz and will provide at least 1.5 Joules per pulse at the 1064 nanometer (nm) fundamental for the secondary function; higher pulse energies are desirable.  Short-term 1064 nm pulse energy variations will not exceed ± 3 % for 99 % of the pulses over any 1 hour period.  Long-term (8 hour) average 1064 nm pulse energy drift will not exceed ± 3 %.  Duration of the 1064 nm pulse must fall within the 5 to 10 nanosecond (ns) range.  Timing jitter between the 1064 nm pulse and an externally accessible TTL trigger output signal must not exceed ± 1 ns.  The 1064 nm laser linewidth will not exceed 0.003 reciprocal-centimeters (cm-1).  The 1064 nm beam near field intensity spatial profile will approximate as closely as possible a “top hat” or “flat top” distribution (essential for the secondary application), with over 99 % of the beam energy contained within a 1 cm radius from the beam center.  The pointing stability of the 355 nm OPO pump beam will not exceed ± 30 micro-radians.  The OPO will provide tunable output covering the 450 nm to 1700 nm wavelength range; a small tuning gap near 710 nm is acceptable, but the absence of such a gap is preferred.  Vendor is invited to propose a wavelength extension option to provide for tunable output into the ultraviolet spectral region.  The OPO will provide pulse energies of at least:  50 milli-Joules (mJ) at 500 nm, 50 mJ at 600 nm, 30 mJ at 800 nm, 10 mJ at 1000 nm, and 5 mJ at 1600 nm.  Short-term OPO pulse energy variations will not exceed ± 10 % for 99 % of the pulses over any 1 hour period.  Long-term (8 hour) average OPO pulse energy drift will not exceed ± 10 %.  Duration of the OPO pulse must not exceed 10 ns.  Timing jitter between the OPO pulse and an externally accessible TTL trigger output signal must not exceed ± 2 ns.  The OPO linewidth must not exceed 0.08 cm-1 throughout the tuning range.  The diameter of the OPO beam (99 % beam energy) will not exceed 1 cm.  The divergence of the OPO beam will not exceed 2 milli-radians.  

Hardware/Software Manuals:  Vendor will include pricing for all technical manuals necessary to operate the proposed hardware and software.   

Serviceability and Warranty:  Vendor is invited to describe any special design or manufacturing considerations for their system which may reduce or eliminate the need for on-site service visits.  Vendor will clearly describe which parts are covered under the standard Warranty, the duration of the standard Warranty, and their estimated daily labor rate for an on-site service visit.  Vendor is invited to propose as an option an extended Warranty plan which will cover all parts, labor, and travel charges for a limited time period.

BACKGROUND

The Department of Commerce has been presented with a unique opportunity to market and promote the United States as a top tourism destination.  To best market the United States travel product abroad requires creating mechanisms that will encourage regional collaboration, private sector participation, cooperative brand marketing and the appropriate method for measuring return on investment or evaluation of the program's success.  It is important to note that the U.S. Government (USG) has not been involved in tourism promotional efforts since 1995.

As a precursor to designing an effective program and targeted promotional effort, it is important to involve stakeholder opinions and ideas, to develop ways to ensure private and public sector financial involvement, and to be prepared to measure program effectiveness.  In an atmosphere of terrorist threats and necessary improved border security systems, it is critical to consult and collaborate with other diplomatic and image efforts being conducted through other USG initiatives. Ways in which the balance can be maintained between promoting the U.S. to international targeted markets and implementing safety and security systems and procedures would also need to be addressed.
 
Task Order Title: 	Strategic Tourism Marketing Research
		
OBJECTIVE

To conduct a comprehensive research study to explore in depth a number of key issues, such as private sector collaboration, funding mechanisms, USG agency coordination and evaluation measurement methodologies, for building a strategic marketing plan for promoting the United States internationally as a tourism destination.

SCOPE, SCHEDULE AND DELIVERABLES FOR STATEMENT OF WORK


Task 1: 	Determine target markets for the international advertising and promotion campaign and the media mix, promotional methods and tourism products best suited for each target market.
 
Using the initial selection of markets which hold the most promise as stated by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Trade Development and Office of Travel and Tourism Industries experts (Canada, Mexico, United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, France, and possibly Brazil, Italy and South Korea), the contractor shall: 

1.  Develop a matrix of regional marketing groups, states and cities who are currently and actively promoting in specific markets and determine which ones they would be interested in entering if not currently present.  This matrix would serve as part of the evaluation of target markets.	

 
2.	Validate the initial selection of the international markets to be targeted by conducting research with 25-35 key industry constituents on their level of agreement with potential markets as suggested by Commerce.

3.    Conduct interviews with 25-35 key industry constituents and marketers on the best approach to take for reaching each individual targeted market effectively.  This interview will cover queries on best media mix, in-market promotional activities and identification of tourism products most suited for each market. The constituents should include members of the Visit USA committee's in-market for the target markets.

	Schedule:  This investigation should be designed and completed three weeks after contract award.

	Deliverable:  The contractor shall deliver a written report not longer than 10 pages that addresses overall findings on the concurrence or dispute of the market selections and recommendations for the target markets.  The report should also denote the best media-mix, promotional activities and products for each suggested market.  Included in the report, each market shall be specifically detailed with the findings on the best promotional directions to take as a result of the interviews. 


Task II.	Determine the most appropriate methodologies for effectively evaluating promotional activities within the markets.

		It is well recognized that measuring a return on investment (ROI) for tourism advertising and promotion is individualized to each campaign.  With this in mind and considering the results of Task I, the contractor shall:

1.	Conduct interviews with 25 - 35 key industry constituents and marketers on the different and distinct methods employed for measuring effectiveness for international tourism advertising, for promotional activities, including familiarization tours, and for promotional, public relations and media events in international markets.  This includes approaches for benchmarks prior to campaigns and activities.

2.	Conduct interviews with a selection of 10 - 15 non-tourism industry marketers to determine the different and distinct methods employed for measuring effectiveness for international advertising, for promotional activities, and for promotional, public relations and media events in international markets. This includes approaches for benchmarks prior to campaigns and activities. The contractor shall propose the intended list of contacts, to be agreed upon by DOC.

3.	Conduct interviews with a selection of 8 - 12 top tourism and non-tourism research firms on how return-on-investment (ROI) evaluations are performed for international advertising, for promotional activities, including familiarization tours, and for promotional, public relations and media events in international markets.  This includes approaches for benchmarks prior to campaigns and activities.

4.	Conduct interviews with a selection of 5 - 8 top national tourism organizations (NTO's) on how return on investment (ROI) evaluations are performed for international advertising, for promotional activities, including familiarization tours, and for promotional, public relations and media events in international markets.  This includes approaches for benchmarks prior to campaigns and activities.

5.	Identify key secondary resources available, gauging international tourism flows and impacts, and for measuring overall return on investment (ROI) for increased advertising and promotional activities in international markets.  This includes data that can be used for benchmarks prior to campaigns and activities.

	
Schedule:  This investigation shall be designed and completed within four weeks.

	Deliverable:  A written document not longer than 15 pages shall be provided which addresses overall findings for each of the steps in Task II.  This report shall contain an executive summary with recommendations on the best methods to employ for gaining an evaluation of the effectiveness and return on investment for specific international advertising, for promotional activities, including familiarization tours, and for promotional, public relations and media events in international markets.   A more detailed account shall follow divided by each proposed targeted market as to the results of the investigations and interviews on measurements for each form of advertising and promotional activity, both from the perspective of tourism marketers and non-tourism marketers.



Task III.	Determine the most effective methods for engaging private sector and developing matching fund capabilities with private sector.

		Certainly the most effective campaigns are those that effectively perform industry outreach and capitalize on partnerships and expanded funding capabilities, particularly for the international markets.  Sustaining power in the marketplace comes through these partnerships as well as effective collaborative efforts.  With this in mind the contractor shall:

1.  Interview 25 - 35 industry representatives to identify outreach approaches the industry stakeholders are expecting as part of the development of the DOC international advertising and promotional campaign.
		
2.	Investigate and compare successful matching fund mechanisms and in-kind contribution models employed by key national, regional, state and local tourism destinations for international marketing. 

3.	Investigate and identify ways in which airlines and airports, trade associations and Visit USA committees can be involved and leveraged for their current and future programs and resources with the DOC campaign.

4.	Investigate and identify ways to collaborate with tourism promotion activities through such avenues as major travel web sites and online reservation engines.

5.	Investigate and identify mechanisms for successfully collaborating with international tour operators in the target markets for marketing special U.S.A. packages.

6.	Investigate and identify models most likely to increase the participation of non-traditional partners, such as foundations and corporations in related industries.


Schedule:  This investigation shall be designed and completed within four weeks.

	Deliverable:  A written document not longer than 15 pages shall be provided which addresses overall findings for each of the steps in Task III.  This report shall contain an executive summary with recommendations on the best methods for outreach to meet the expectations of key industry stakeholders and to identify ways to maximize the initial investment for the campaign with matching fund mechanisms, including in-kind contributions, methods for collaborating with tour operators and trade in the targeted markets and models to use for garnering non-traditional partners.   A more detailed account shall follow the summary for addressing the results of interviews and investigations on how best to maximize and expand the original investment in the campaign. 








Task IV. 	Determine ways to leverage other federal agency international promotional efforts and the potential synergy offered by broader efforts of the United States government.
 
1.	Investigate and identify other federal efforts, specifically in the White House, the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department, which need to be enhanced and coordinated with the DOC international promotional campaign. This includes assessing how to collaborate with the White House's Global Communications Initiative.

2.	Investigate activities and promotional efforts throughout other federal government agencies and offices that could serve as enhancements to the promotional campaign.  Use the Tourism Policy Council Working Group in DOC as the contact list.

3.	Investigate and identify cooperative funding opportunities within federal government agencies to expand the DOC campaign value.


Schedule:  This investigation shall be designed and completed within two weeks.

	Deliverable:  A written document not longer than 10 pages shall be provided which addresses overall findings for each of the steps in Task IV.  This report shall contain an executive summary with recommendations on how to offer synergy and collaboration with other federal agencies and programs.  A more detailed account shall follow the summary for addressing the results of interviews and investigations on how best to maximize and expand the original investment in the campaign with other federal efforts and how to best compliment and balance image and safety and security needs of the U.S. with the campaign.

<CONTACT>-  2083785364     ;
<DESC>The NAISC code for this requirement is 922120.  The Bureau of Reclamation's (Reclamation) Pacific Northwest Regional Office intends to negotiate a sole-source, cost-sharing contract with the Crook County Sheriff (Sheriff), Prineville, Oregon to modify the Sheriff's existing communication repeater system to provide radio communications for Reclamation's Authur R. Bowman Dam and the area surrounding Prineville Reservoir.  Reclamation has determined that a critical lack in radio communication coverage exists at Arthur R. Bowman Dam and Prineville Reservoir. Reclamation expects to greatly reduce the overall design, environmental permit, and construction costs by not having to build a new repeater site on public lands adjacent to the reservoir boundary.  The Department of the Interior's (DOI) Radio Communications Handbook encourages cooperation with other entities willing to share their networks with DOI agencies for mutually beneficial purposes.  The Sheriff, Reclamation, Oregon Parks & Recreation Department (OPRD), Ochoco Irrigation District (OID), Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and Crook County Fire Department (Fire) may benefit from increased communication ability in the area.  The Sheriff shall be responsible for modifying its repeater system to provide Reclamation full communication coverage at Arthur R. Bowman Dam's control house, downstream sites, and other sites around the Prineville Reservoir area.  The proposed contract action is for communication access for which Reclamation intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by Reclamation. A determination by Reclamation not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of Reclamation. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. See Numbered Note 26.

Department of Commerce, National Weather Service (NWS), Radar Operations Center (ROC) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), with Peerless-Winsmith, Inc. for review and refinement of the existing Peerless-Winsmith gearbox backlash setting procedures for the Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Dopler (WSR-88D).  The following is a list of what is minimally expected to accomplish the analysis:
1)	The contractor shall review the current backlash setting procedures described in section 2-4.4.2 and 2-4.4.3 of Engineering Handbooks EHB 6-513 and EHB 6-514 and recommend changes to the government with the following objectives: 
A)	A USAF 5 skill level technician can execute the procedures.  
B)	The procedures achieve a repeatable accuracy of 0.004-0.006 inches between the output pinion of the gearbox and the bull gear.  
C)	The procedures require no additional site tools or equipment (additional tools or equipment are subject to government approval).  See Appendix A for a list of site equipment.  
2)	The contractor shall account for the "high point" of the bull gear and give instruction for locating it.  
3)	The contractor shall account for the existing backlash of the gearbox.  
4)	The contractor shall provide a method in the procedures for validating that the correct backlash has been obtained.  
5)	The contractor shall provide procedures for the azimuth and elevation gearboxes on a LPP and FSP assembly.  
6)	The contractor shall submit a draft copy of the procedures and full tool list to the government.  
7)	Following the government acceptance of the draft copy of the procedures, the contractor shall validate the final procedures through a field demonstration of all procedures on a LPP and FSP WSR-88D pedestal.  For estimation purposes, assume the field demonstration will occur in Kansas City, MO.  
8)	The contractor shall deliver 2 hardcopies and 1 electronic copy of the procedure.  
9)	If the backlash of the gearboxes is required to complete the procedure, the contractor shall deliver a list of the backlash settings for all gearboxes purchased from or repaired by Peerless-Winsmith that are currently in the field or stock.  
10)	If any tools or equipment are required to complete the procedure, but are not a part of the site tool and equipment stock, the contractor shall deliver two sets of the required tools and equipment in traveling cases suitable for shipping with delivery of the final procedure.
Please incorporate these ten items in the following three stages and submit your proposal broken out by cost for each stage:
	**STAGE ONE**:  Evaluation of the current installation and backlash procedures, and the hardware directly associated with the setting of the gearbox.  From this evaluation, propose one or more conceptual solutions for setting the backlash including a time frame for the work to be completed.  The length of time to complete stage one will be no more than 30 days.
	**STAGE TWO**:  Based on the proposal from stage one, the contractor will conduct a field investigation at a location of the government's choice.  From the field investigation, the contractor will submit a detailed proposal for setting the backlash.  This proposal will not be the final proposal, but a presentation of the contractor's solution for government approval.  At this time, the government will have the option to approve the proposal and continue to stage three or terminate the last stage of the contract.
	**STAGE THREE**:  Develop the final procedure and verify the validity of the procedure through a formal demonstration.  Prior to the demonstration, the contractor will provide documentation of the procedure in the form of two (2) hardcopies and one (1) electronic copy.  The length of time for completion of stage three will be no more than 30 days from approval of stage two.

<SUBJECT>--Guided Interceptor Technology for Active Protection Against Kinetic Energy Penetrators
<DESC>NA Pursuant to FAR 15.2, this notice is being issued as a Research and Development Information Sought.  Contract POC:  Marcia Tully, Phone 256-842-7406, Email marcia.tully@redstone.army.mil. The US Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development, and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) is soliciting information on technology applicable to a guided interceptor for use in light armored vehicle active protection systems (APS).   THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  It is part of a technology survey to assist in the planning of possible future programs.  Informal or white paper responses are encouraged  An effort is underway investigating the feasibility of protecting lightly armored manned combat vehicles from attack by kinetic energy (KE) penetrators using an APS equipped with a guided interceptor.  The guided interceptor is assumed to be part an integr ated APS which includes other countermeasures and sensors of various kinds.  It may use these sensors to perform the functions of threat detection, cueing (if needed), target acquisition, tracking, and (or) fire control.  Other functions that may be perfor med by the APS or vehicle sensors and processors include threat discrimination, vehicle to interceptor communication, or a number of possible interceptor guidance functions.  One of the objectives of the on-going investigation is to identify optimum combin ations of guidance and control technologies, identify necessary sensor and processor functions required to support a guided interceptor defeating KE penetrators, and establish performance requirements. The primary threat for defeat by this guided interceptor is the long-rod KE penetrator fired by modern threat tank main armament.  Velocities approaching 1700 m/s may be typical.  Defeat of this threat requires that no lethal damage to a lightly armored ve hicle result from the engagement.  It may be assumed that threat KE penetrators can be fired from ranges very close out to 2000m. Questions or comments on demonstrated or potentially feasible technologies for this application are invited and should be addressed to the POC below.  Appropriate proprietary claims will be honored and protected to prevent improper disclosure.  Responses s hall be provided by 31 August 2003 to US Army Aviation and Missile Command, AMSAM-AC-OS-RBB/Marcia Tully, Redstone Arsenal, AL  35898, or via email: marcia.tully@redstone.army.mil.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS
Solicitation No. S-LMAQM-03-R-0099
"Advertising: Promotion of IIP Arabic Language Websites"


Goal:
Promote identification of the Department of State's International Information Program (IIP) Arabic language websites.

Background:
Through a targeted internet campaign, IIP's G/NEA-SA office intends to advertise its Arabic language websites with the goal of establishing our web presence as the definitive source of information on the United States and U.S. Government policy in the Middle East and Arabic speaking world.  The campaign, which will target the best established internet portals and Arabic internet services in the Middle East and the Arabic speaking Diaspora, will introduce our sites to those who may not be familiar with our services, as well as establish a baseline for compilation of statistics on the use and growth of our sites.  Additionally, the campaign will advertise our "Rebuilding Afghanistan" website in Arabic, assuring our Middle Eastern audience that the U.S. follows through with its obligations and promises.  

By constructing a two-month campaign targeting seven to ten different internet portals and popular newspaper and electronic media sites known to attract the largest number of Arabic speaking users, we intend to  gather relevant statistics for future assessments of impact, as well as provide initial product identification for our relatively-new Arabic website presence.

The target audience is Arabic language web users.  These web users are generally young, affluent, educated, and interested in the world beyond their own borders.

Overview:
The contractor shall, in coordination with IIP/G/NEA-SA personnel, perform the following tasks:

	1) Develop graphic designs for the advertisements,
	2) Identify those sites on which advertisements shall be placed,
	3) Establish a budget for a two-month run of the internet ads.

The ads must target the most substantive and popular Arabic language websites.  Any of the following would be considered appropriate:

Al Jazeera (Qatar)
www.aljazeera.net/,


MSN Arabia (Arabic & English)
www.Arabia.msn.com/,

Arabia (United Arab Emirates)
www.Arabia.com,

Asharq Al-Awsat (London)
www.asharqalawsat.com,

BBC
www.news.bbc.co.uk/hi/Arabic/news/,

CNN
arabic.cnn.com/,

Al-Arab online (London)
www.alarabonline.org/,

Al Bahhar (United Arab Emirates)
www.albahhar.com/,

Dar al hayat (London)
www.daralhayat.com/,

Al Bawaba (Jordan)
www.albawaba.com/,

Omeldonia (Egypt)
www.omeldonia.com/,

Masrawy (Egypt)
www.masrawy.com/,

Naseej (Saudi Arabia)
www.naseej.com,

Egypty (Egypt)
www.egypty.com.

Types of ads: The campaign must employ a variety of ads, using those types which best fit the media choice involved, such as "banners" (a framed ad module that sits at the top of the a webpage), "skyscrapers" (a tall, narrow ad module located to the far right or left of a webpage), and pop-up windows.

Graphic Concept: Branding is important, and IIP wants to advertise exactly what it represents.  The ad must have:

USINFO.STATE.GOV and a US flag.

Other identifying features will be determined at a final layout stage through consultation with IIP personnel.

Evaluating Effectiveness: IIP/G/NEA-SA's webmasters will set baselines ahead of the campaign and then monitor increases in usage.  The contractor must be prepared to provide advice or suggestions based on its experience with previously successful internet advertising campaigns.

Scope of Work:
I.  	Develop internet campaign placement strategy,
II.  	Provide an assessment of each individual media outlet's requirements,
III.	Ensure that branding and graphics fit IIP's requirements and reflect IIP's message,
IV.	Adapt to last-minute changes contingent upon the policy and media environments.

Towards these ends, the contractor must:
- Present evidence of previous internet campaigns for similar projects, especially those directed at Arabic language audiences.
- Be prepared to work with IIP personnel as identified
- Deliver a series of ads that fit various internet formats
- Provide a plan which includes adequate repetition of IIP's graphics to clearly identify IIP's Arabic sites to users.

Proposal Requirements:
Please prepare and submit proposals in two separate parts.  The first part, a narrative "technical proposal," should detail your approach to satisfying our requirements.  It must also address and background and experience your firm and its personnel have in conducting similar campaigns in Arabic.  This section will be reviewed by Department program personnel in need of this service.

The second part, a "business proposal," must provide a detailed breakdown of anticipated/proposed costs, explaining how your firm arrived at its final contract price.  This section will be reviewed independently of the "technical proposal" by the Department's contracting office.  The Department anticipates awarding a firm fixed-price contract.

For evaluation purposes, technical merit, cost factors, and past experience will all be weighted equally.

To be eligible for award, your proposal must be received in the contracting office by 12:00 noon (Washington, DC time) on Tuesday, September 2, 2003.  Please send your proposal to:

U.S. Department of State,
A/LM/AQM/IP,
301 Fourth St., SW, Room M-22,
Washington, DC  20547,
Attn: Gerald L. Guilbert,
Phone: 202-260-5004,
E-mail: guilbertgl@state.gov.

Any questions concerning this solicitation should be directed to Mr. Guilbert.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

A completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, "Offeror Representations and Certifications – Commercial Items," should be returned with your proposal.

The following provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition:
FAR 52.212-1, "Instructions to Offerors – Commercial Items"
