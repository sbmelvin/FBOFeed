<DESC>NASA/DFRC intends to issue a contract performance schedule extension in-order tocomplete developmental efforts for the SOFIA B747SP Platform Project awarded undercontract number NND07PS02C to L-3 Communications Integrated Systems, Waco, TX.	Thecurrent contract performance schedule ends on December 31, 2011.  The schedule extensionwill be for a period of not-to-exceed thirty-six (36) months and will be in-conjunctionwith the overall SOFIA Program Master Schedule.  The majority of the remainingrequirements scheduled to be completed are associated with the development and testing ofthe SOFIA Mission Controls and Communications System (MCCS).  It is anticipated thatcompletion of the MCCS requirement will lead to a declaration of Full OperationalCapability (FOC) for the SOFIA platform to include full functionality of airborne,instrument, and ground systems.  Note: It is noted that at the time of initial contractaward that not all of the developmental requirements were fully known and/or clearlydefined.  As development work has progressed there have been various engineering changenotices (ECNs) and revised performance work statements (PWSs) issued by the Government. These changes, along with budgetary and other unanticipated schedule impacts have hadthe effect of requiring more schedule time (as opposed to cost)  to complete the SOFIAplatform technical requirements.  As a result, the current developmental schedule forcontract NND07PS02C is considered to be on programmatic schedule while incurred cost andcontract funding have been significantly under running the negotiated contact value.  Based on current estimates, the Government believes that the remaining technical effortrequired for completion of the programmatic requirements can be completed within thecurrent estimated cost ceiling with adjustments made to the award fee performance poolfor new work requirements identified in the latest changes to the SOFIA PWS.  The SOFIA program is a cooperative effort between NASA and DLR, the German AerospaceAgency. The SOFIA observatory consists of a 2.7-meter (2.5-meter useable) diameterTelescope Assembly (TA) mounted inside a modified Boeing 747SP aircraft.  The primarygoal of the SOFIA program is to further scientific knowledge in the field of astronomyand astrophysics.Authority is FAR 6.302-1  Only one responsible source.  Justification is based upon thefollowing facts:  1) the performance schedule extension (FAR 42.302(b) (3) and NFS1817.204(e) (2)) is required for completion of program Phase D (system assembly,integration, testing, and launch phase); 2) L-3 Communications is the only responsiblesource since they have already completed a significant portion of the contractual effort. As a result, they are uniquely and intimately familiar with the Airborne Systemdevelopment and characteristics, particularly as they apply to the evolving SOFIAproject.  Due to the immense complexities of the SOFIA project, and theinterrelationships of Government and contractor participants, the time needed to gainthis knowledge and expertise would cause unacceptable disruptions to that progress,particularly since the Airborne System is currently on the program schedule CriticalPath.	  As a result, award of a new contract to any other contractor for completion ofthe requirements would likely result in: a) Substantial duplication of cost to theGovernment that is not expected to be recovered through competition due to replication ofdevelopment and test facilities; b) unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencysrequirements; and c) design and integration issues resulting from having multiplecontractors involved with systems development issues. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform theeffort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local timeon October 22, 2011.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for thepurpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and opencompetition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretionof the government.Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.   The installation Ombudsman is Mr.Patrick Stoliker (661) 276-2706.

<DESC>THIS RFI (posted 10/07/2011) IS POSTED FOR DATA GATHERING AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY
<p>Request for Information: National Information Technology Commodity Program (NITCP)<br />Agency: General Services Administration<br />Office: Federal Acquisition Service, National Information Technology Commodity Program<br />Location: Region 4, Atlanta, GA</p>
<p>Synopsis: 4QBF47116837</p>
<p>Request for Information (RFI): THIS RFI IS POSTED FOR DATA GATHERING AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY, DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION, AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO ISSUE A SOLICITATION, BLANKET PURCHASE AGREEMENT (BPA) OR AWARD A CONTRACT. The Government will not reimburse any respondent for any costs associated with information submitted in response to this RFI. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS RFI IS TO PROMOTE COLLABORATION WITH THE VENDOR COMMUNITY AND ALLOW THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT ON THE DRAFT TABLET REQUIREMENTS. Please provide comments to proposed requirements. As this project advances the RFI may be revised.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND: The General Services Administration's (GSA) Federal Acquisition Service (FAS) Global Supply Program has historically marketed and stocked basic computer supplies and accessories to federal customers, through the GSA Depot Distribution Centers and also offered these products through its Direct Delivery (DD) program. In 2002, a plan was developed to substantially expand the Global Supply Program Business Line's product offering by creating a relationship between various Schedules vendors and the Supply Business Line through the use of Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) against the vendors' existing Multiple Award Schedules (MAS) contracts. The plan was called Expanded Direct Delivery (EDD).<br /><br />SCOPE: The EDD Computer BPA will be broken down into the following categories: (1) Laptops, (2) Netbooks, (3) Tablets, (4) Desktops, (5) All-in-one Desktops, and (6) Specialty Computers such as rugged computers for military purposes. The intent of this BPA is not to include any other IT products such as peripherals, but to focus solely on a dominating presence in computers. This RFI is being issued to survey industry on the types of Computers listed above that are available on the commercial market that are: (1) TAA compliant, (2) FIPS 140-2 certified, and (3) meet the federal government's security requirements. The end result of this RFI is to issue a BPA that will meet the three requirements listed above and provide federal agencies a contracting vehicle to purchase a variety of computers at competitive prices. <br />INTENDED ACQUISITION METHOD: This acquisition is currently intended as the establishment of a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) against Multiple Award Schedule 70, titled General Purpose Commercial Information Technology Equipment, Software, and Services. All Contractors under SIN 132-8 Purchase of New Equipment will receive direct notification of this requirement. <br />INTENDED ACQUISITION PERIOD: A base period and four option period(s) for a total potential term of 5 years. The anticipated duration of the requirement is anticipated to exceed the base period.</p>
<p>MANDATES</p>
<p>1. Vendor has an existing Schedule 70 contract(s)<br />2. All Items must be TAA Compliant</p>
<p>REQUEST</p>
<p>GSA respectfully offers the opportunity for industry to provide input in response to this RFI and collaborate with the government as it continues to draft potential business requirements.</p>
<p>Please provide a response to the following questions, in addition to any other relevant feedback:</p>
<p>1. Based on your knowledge of the requirements of federal agencies, what are the minimum salient characteristics that would be available on Schedule and required by a federal customer for each of the following categories? If you feel these categories should be changed, please specify. <br />a) Laptops<br />b) Netbooks<br />c) Tablets<br />d) Desktops<br />e) All-In One Desktops<br />f) Ruggedized Computers</p>
<p>2. The government has identified ruggedized computers as specialty computers. Can you propose any other computer's that would also fall into this category?<br />3. The government wants to attract offerors that can provide both deep discounts and legitimate product breadth. Provide any recommendations on how to develop a solicitation to achieve both? <br />4. What are the top two selling computers your company currently sells to the federal government in each of the categories (laptops, netbooks, tablets, desktops, all-in-one desktops, specialty computers)? Also, identify whether or not each of these top selling products are TAA compliant, and further whether you sell the product on schedule or not. <br />5. The government intends to propose a delivery within 5 days ARO<br />6. Explain your company experience with Supply Chain Management capabilities<br />7. Explain your company experience with Interfacing with GSA systems through the vendor supplier network.<br />Device Recycling and Disposal - Explain how you would propose device (tablet) recycling and disposal process, including answering the following:</p>
<p>a) If you currently offer a recycling and disposal process to customers, including Federal, State, or Local government agencies, describe the process.</p>
<p>b) Have all facilities in your recycling and disposal process been certified to safely recycle and manage electronics? If so, what certification standards do they use?</p>
<p>c) Do you follow any guidelines, including NIST SP800-88 Guidelines for Media Sanitization, to ensure safety of customer data?</p>

The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division intends to enter into an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) with Northrop Grumman, 44 Castilian Drive, Goleta, California 93117.  The IDIQ will cover a five year period with a minimum of one and maximum of five to procure Multi-Domain Electronic Warfare Test and Evaluation System (METES).
  The non-commercial solicitation will be issued using other than full and open competition to Northrop Grumman IAW FAR 6.302 and statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  The basis for restricting competition is the proprietary nature of the technical data for the system resulting in a lack of drawings and specifications, in addition to duplicative costs and time that would be required to reverse engineer the system.  
The proposed IDIQ is for a METES system or systems for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, Northrop Grumman, under authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  The basis for restricting competition is the proprietary information of Northrop Grumman, form, fit, and function compatibility and the duplicative cost to the Government to utilize another source to satisfy the Government’s requirements.
This requirement was previously posted under #N00164-11-R-WR47 on 16 MAR 2011 and was amended to reflect the correct Solicitation number N00164-11-R-WM47.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Sources Sought Notice No.: SS-ETSB-100711-56
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business concern; (2) whether they are small business; HUBZone small business; service-disabled, veteran-owned small business; 8(a) small business; veteran-owned small business; woman-owned small business; or small disadvantage business; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>The NAICS code for this project is 541990.<br />The small business size standard is $7.0 million in annual receipts.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The mission of the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) is to conduct population and multidisciplinary research to discover the genetic and environmental determinants of cancer and new approaches to cancer prevention. Most studies from the Division have molecular biology components that require the isolation of biomolecules from a variety of material types, such as whole blood, transformed lymphoblastoid cells, buccal cells, paraffin-embedded tissue, tumor tissue, etc. The availability of high quality preparations of cellular biomolecules from these sources has contributed to a wealth of information regarding the discovery of genetic and environmental determinants of cancer. These findings have come from family, population, clinical and translational studies undertaken by investigators in many DCEG branches including the Genetic Epidemiology Branch (GEB), Clinical Genetics Branch (CGB), Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch (OEEB), and the Infections and Immunoepidemiology Branch (IIB).</p>
<p>There are a variety of biological materials that are important for estimating levels of biomarkers that may fluctuate with disease status. Examples include biomarkers of immune response, profiles of cytokines and characterization of other cellular phenotypes. Many of these assays, as well as other biomarker measurements, require the isolation and cryopreservation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and other cell types as source materials for these assays.</p>
<p>The ability to isolate cellular components from fresh biospecimens received from clinical and field sites is essential in order for many of these downstream analyses to be performed. In order to perform these isolations, specimens must be processed before they are frozen, and once processed, must be frozen or "cryopreserved" under carefully controlled circumstances.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives</p>
<p>The purpose of this project is to provide support for the processing of fresh biological specimens from field and clinical settings by receiving whole blood and other biospecimens, isolating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), immortalizing cell lines with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), isolating nucleic acids, and cryopreserving a variety of cell types, as needed.<br /><br />The processing is essential in order for the processed biomaterials to be available for genetic, immunological, and other analyses based on DNA, RNA and protein composition. The studies to be supported by this project have been designed to understand the etiology of certain rare diseases, family-based cancers and other large population based initiatives.</p>
<p>Project requirements</p>
<p>Major tasks required of the Contractor include the following:</p>
<p>1. Specimen Processing: a) Receipt and processing of fresh whole blood and other biospecimens such as serum, plasma, buccal cells, bone marrow, tumor and non-tumor tissue, lymphocytes/leukocytes, culture fibroblasts: b) Isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for subsequent nucleic acid isolation, transformation with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV): c) Transformation of lymphocytes and/or cryopreserved whole blood to lymphoblastoid cells using the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV): d) Cryopreservation of PBMCs, granulocytes, bone marrow cell preparations as well as other material types: e) Expansion of lymphoblastoid or other types of cell lines up to gram quantities: f) Extraction of nucleic acids from fresh specimen and some frozen specimens, as needed.

<p>5. Communication with the COTR and DCEG Investigators: a) Consult with the COTR on ongoing testing, as well as any other aspect of the contract effort: b) Provide guidance to DCEG Investigators on specific issues identified by the COTR: c) Advise and make recommendations regarding innovative, cutting edge approaches to specimen collection and processing.</p>
<p>6. Initial and Final Transition Plan: a) Ensure the orderly, efficient and safe transition of all contract activities and biospecimen materials within a pre-determined period of time.</p>
<p>As part of the work under this potential contract quarterly and final technical report are expected. In addition, Queue, Cost Accounting System (CAS), Emergency Response and Specimen Damage reports are expected.</p>
<p>Other important considerations</p>
<p>This work requires the Contractor to have the capability of receiving and processing fresh whole blood, as well as fresh lymphocytes tumor samples, or other types of fresh specimens each weekday from Monday through Thursday. As little as three hours or four hours notice may be given (routine submission of samples may be scheduled several days in advance).</p>
<p>This work requires the Contractor to have the capability to receive and process any fresh specimens within 24 hours after the specimen has been received. Specimens requiring immediate processing may number 10 or fewer on a typical weekday (more samples may be received on occasional exceptions on a pre-scheduled date).</p>
<p>All biological materials delivered will need to be packaged in appropriate containers and delivered according to Department of Transportation regulations.</p>
<p>Anticipated period of performance<br />The anticipated period of performance for this requirement is one year, with four one-year options.</p>

<DESC>THE U. S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION (NRC) is issuing this Sources Sought Synopsis as a means of conducting market research or as a market survey to determine the availability and potential technical capability of the business community to provide technical assistance in performing sample analysis, document reviews, radiological surveys (i.e., scoping, characterization, remedial action support, in-process, and final status), and special projects related to non-power/power nuclear reactor, fuel facility, uranium recovery, and materials facilities undergoing decommissioning for the Office of Federal and State Materials and Environmental Management Programs and Office of Administration. Services are to be provided to the NRC in Rockville, MD. These support services are currently being performed by an interagency agreement with the Department of Energy. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code&nbsp;is 541620 - environmental consulting services and the associated size standard is $7 million.
<p>THERE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROOSALS. This request for capability information does not constitute a request for proposals. Submission of any information in response to this market survey is purely voluntary. The Government assumes no financial responsibility for any costs incurred.</p>
<p>If your organization has the potential capacity to perform these&nbsp;services, please provide the following information: 1) organization name, address, email address, Web site address and telephone number, and ttype of ownership for the organization; 2) tailored capability statements addressing the particulars of this effort, with appropriate documentation supporting claims of organizational and staff capability; and 3) responses to questions 1-10 below. Organizations responding to this market survey should keep in mind that only focused and pertinent information is requested. Do not submit budget information. If significant subcontracting or teaming is anticipated in order to deliver technical capability, organizations should address the administrative and management structure of such arrangements. Taking into account the magnitude of the scope of this professional recruitment effort, organizations also should address the capacity of their financial infrastructure to coordinate and deliver contract performance. Respondents must be have no conflicts of interest (COI).&nbsp;If responding organizations are located outside the Washington Metropolitan area, indicate how the organization will coordinate with the NRC program office located at NRC Headquarters in Rockville, MD.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>As part of its mission to protect the public health and safety and the environment, the NRC conducts routine and special inspections of sites to be decommissioned. During these inspections, samples are collected to determine the radiological status and provide an independent verification of the radiological condition of the site.</p>
<p>In addition to routine and special inspections, the provisions of 10 CFR Part 20, Subpart E, and related criteria applicable to the decommissioning of facilities licensed under Parts 30, 40, 50, 60, 61, 70, and 72 (as well as other facilities subject to the Commissions jurisdiction) require NRC licensees to submit a License Termination Plan (LTP) or Decommissioning Plan (DP) to demonstrate compliance with the radiological criteria for license termination. In making the determination that the supporting documentation and the final radiation survey demonstrate that the site is suitable for release, NRC staff conducts: 1) technical reviews of all decommissioning-related documents; 2) in-process inspections to verify the adequacy of decommissioning activities; and 3) confirmatory surveys to validate the final radiation survey. In order to accomplish these tasks, contractor assistance is required to provide survey instrumentation and laboratory analysis capabilities that are otherwise not available in-house to NRC staff and to augment the NRC staff's technical expertise.</p>
<p>Scientific, technical, and/or other personnel assigned to this task shall have extensive expertise in health physics and radio chemistry in the following areas: 1) design and conduct of radiological surveys in accordance with MARSSIM and NRC guidance, NRC rules, regulations, and inspection procedures; 2) sample preparation, collection methods, analysis techniques, and interpretation of sample data; 3) non-power/power nuclear reactors systems and operations, materials, fuel cycle, uranium recovery, and Site Decommissioning Management Plan sites; and 4) technical knowledge and operational use of survey (i.e., portable instruments, contamination detectors, and in-situ gamma spectroscopy) and laboratory (i.e., gas-proportional counters, liquid scintillation counters, gamma and alpha spectroscopy, and radio chemical separations) instrumentation.</p>
<p>Capability Sought:<br />The NRC is seeking to identify commercial organizations capable of providing technical assistance in performing sample analysis, document reviews, radiological surveys (i.e., scoping, characterization, remedial action support, in-process, and final status), and special projects related to non-power/power nuclear reactor, fuel facility, uranium recovery, and materials facilities undergoing decommissioning.</p>
<p>Respondents must demonstrate their ability to perform the following work requirements:</p>
<p>Sample Analyses - perform laboratory measurements and radio chemical analysis of samples to include smears, soils, sediments, ground and surface water, vegetation, concrete, and other potentially radiologically contaminated media. The types of analysis will include but are not limited to the following: Gamma Spectroscopy, Alpha Spectroscopy, Gross Alpha/Beta, Liquid Scintillation Counting, Isotopic Radium, Isotopic Strontium, and Technetium-99. Laboratory work shall be conducted in accordance with a QA program compliant with ASME-NQA-1, "Quality Assurance Program Requirements for Nuclear Facilities."</p>
<p>Document Reviews - perform technical reviews of a variety of decommissioning documents to include LTPs, DPs, proposed survey and sampling methodologies, technical basis documents, survey reports, sample analysis data, draft NRC regulatory guides, and other assigned special projects.</p>
<p>Radiological Surveys - design and conduct radiological surveys in accordance with agency guidance. Radiological surveys shall be conducted in accordance with an approved Quality Assurance (QA) program.</p>
<p>In-Process Evaluations and Confirmatory Survey Inspections - assist with on-site evaluations and in-process inspections conducted at various stages of the licensee's/non-licensee's decommissioning program in support of its decommissioning survey program or specific request.<br /><br />Special Projects - provide technical assistance to NRC staff on special projects related to nuclear facility operations and decommissioning, development of regulatory guidance, and other projects related to radiological health and safety, such as evaluation of radiological instrumentation and detection sensitivity.</p>
<p>Questions 1-10 (Respondents must answer these questions).</p>
<p>1. How long has your business been in operation?</p>
<p>2. What type of business is your company (i.e. small, 8(a), large, etc.)?</p>
<p>3. What is the size of your company in terms of employees and consultants? (Breakdown the mix between the two categories.)</p>
<p>4. Which GSA FSS contracts, if any, do you possess? When do they expire?</p>
<p>6. Has your company effectively established teams in the past such that you could perform scopes of work outside your core competencies? (Describe the types of work and technical disciplines assembled.)</p>
<p>7. List any companies or government agencies your company plans to perform work for related to civilian nuclear reactors?</p>
<p>8. Has your company previously faced organizational conflict of interest issues with NRC? How were they resolved?</p>
<p>9. Describe any other information your company deems relevant to supporting the inspections of sites to be decommissioned.</p>
<p>10. Describe tasks you have performed in the areas decommissioning of facilities licensed under Parts 30, 40, 50, 60, 61, 70, and 72.</p>
<p>Interested firms responding to this Sources Sought Synopsis are encouraged to structure capability statements in the order of the area of consideration noted above.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation announcement. This is a sources sought synopsis only. This is not a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract. The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of commercially available products that may be of interest to the United States Coast Guard (USCG). The United States Coast Aviation Logistics Center is conducting market research to determine manufacturers and suppliers of Type VII starch-g-acrylic plastic with corn starch.
<p>The USCG is looking for companies capable of providing Type VII (Starch-g-acrylic) dry stripping blast media that meets or exceeds the requirements of Mil Spec MIL-P-85891A. In addition to supply of the media product, a spent media recycling/disposal plan shall be in place in order that spent media generated through aircraft de-painting process results in the generation of a new recyclable product suitable for use as an absorbent material or similar use. This resulting product must have its own Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) to avoid generating a new waste stream. The spent media recycling/disposal plan shall also state where the resulting product will be used and for what purpose.</p>
<p>Responses to this notice should include company name, address, telephone number, point of contact (POC), and complete product/service details, brochures, and etc. which will allow the USCG to understand your product/service and options. Also, state the approximate lead-time for acquiring your product. The Government believes the applicable NAICS Code is 423840. The size of business pursuant to North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) is 100 employees.<br /><br />Please respond to the following questions:</p>
<p>(1) Is your business a large or small business? <br />(2) If small, does your firm qualify as a small, emergent business, or a small, disadvantaged business? <br />(3) If disadvantaged, specify under which disadvantaged group and is your firm certified under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act?<br />(4) Is your firm a certified "hub zone" firm? <br />(5) Is your firm a woman-owned or operated business? <br />(6) Is your firm a certified Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned? <br />(7) Is your product listed on a GSA schedule? <br />(8) Do you have other government agencies using the product, and if so which agencies, POC's and contract numbers? <br />(9) Do you have civilian users of the product, and if so who and POC's.<br />(10) Would you be able to provide a quote for your product to include a base plus option year(s)? If so, what would be the maximum period?</p>
<p>Firms responding to this announcement that fail to provide all of the requested information cannot be used to help the Government make the appropriate acquisition decisions which is the intent of this sources sought notice. This notice is to help the USCG in determining potential sources only. All firms responding to this sources sought notice are advised that their response to this notice is NOT a request to be considered for a contract award.</p>
<p>After the review of the responses to this sources sought announcement, and if the Government still plans to proceed with the acquisition, a solicitation announcement will be published in FEDBIZOPS. Responses to this sources sought synopsis are NOT adequate responses for any future solicitation announcement. All interested offerors will have to respond to the solicitation separately. Again, this is NOT a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract.</p>
<p>Closing date and time for receipt of response is 24 October 2011 at 8:30 a.m. EST. E-mail responses are preferred and may be sent to Gail.M.Twiford@uscg.mil. The secondary point of contact is Cluadette.Y. Surrento@uscg.mil. Telephone responses will not be accepted. Please indicate HSCG38-12-I-800001 in subject line.

GCSS-Army is an Acquisition Category (ACAT) IAM program composed of two components: (1) Army Enterprise Systems Integration Program (AESIP) as the technical enablement component and (2) GCSS-Army (ERP Solution) as the logistics and financial management operations component. AESIP provides the system's enterprise hub services, and centralized master data management and cross-functional business intelligence / analytics. GCSS-Army (ERP Solution) provides logistics and financial management operations functionality to the business enterprise and Warfighting mission areas.<br><br>GCSS-Army is a web-based software suite that utilizes the existing communication infrastructure known as the Unclassified but Sensitive Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNet) and it can also be deployed to units equipped with Combat Service Support Very Small Aperture Terminal (CSS VSAT) and/or CSS Automated Information System Interface (CAISI).  When fielded, GCSS-Army will enable a single operational logistics and financial management operations picture through integration of logistics and financial management operations information at all tactical echelons. The ERP solution chosen for GCSS-Army is SAP . The GCSS-Army system is being developed in multiple increments as functional capabilities are defined and as integration and synchronization opportunities with related systems present opportunities for subsequent increments.<br><br>Future releases of GCSS-Army will provide additional automation for logistics functions not currently automated by a logistics Standard Army Management Information System (STAMIS).

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Marshall Space FlightCenter (MSFC) intends to issue a NASA Research Announcement (NRA), in the December 2011timeframe, entitled Space Launch System (SLS) Advanced Booster Engineering Demonstrationand Risk Reduction.  The NRA is in support of the SLS Program and will solicit appliedresearch proposals which will offer solutions to meeting the Advanced Booster goal ofreducing risk in the areas of affordability, performance, and reliability.  The NRA willsolicit proposals that will 1) provide an Advanced Booster concept in response to a setof top level performance requirements; 2) identify liquid and/or solid booster high riskareas; 3) provide related hardware demonstrations on how risk can be mitigated; and 4)identify high risk areas associated with adaptation of Advanced Booster technology toSLS.  NASA has identified potential target areas for risk mitigation as shown below. However, other high value demonstration proposals for liquid or solid rocket designs fortarget areas beyond those specifically identified are requested.  Offerors may be awardedcontracts for one or multiple target areas in support of liquid or solid engineeringdevelopment and risk reduction.  Multiple awards may be captured via separate ContractLine Items or separate contracts.  Areas of interest include but are not limited to the following:Liquid Rocket BoostersLarge Component Fabrication (Nozzle and Turbo-pump), Modular/Common Components, OxygenRich Technologies, Refined Petroleum (RP) Combustion Performance and Stability, and Reuseof Salt Water Recovered Engines.

It also operates regional offices in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; San Antonio, Texas; San Diego, California; and Arlington, Virginia.

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.</p>
<p><br />PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Provider Capability</p>
<p>1a. This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Local Communications Services. This factor pertains to switch and PBX sites only.</p>
<p>This factor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p><br />(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. <br />(i) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iii) The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum:</p>
<p>52.212-4 Addendum 1-Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or anybody with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority.

All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority (SPCOA) , or Certificate of Operating Authority (COA)) with the state PUC where services are being provided.

If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements.

Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor.

If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change.

When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 &lt;http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a076/a76_rev2003.pdf&gt; competition performance decisions).</p>
<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the MAJCOM ombudsmen: AFSPC/A7K<br />150 Vandenberg Street<br />Peterson AFB CO 80914<br />(P) 719-554-5250<br />(F) 719-554-5299<br />Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.</p>
<p>(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.</p>
<p>(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer. <br />(End of clause)</p>
<p><br />5352.223-9000 Elimination of Use of Class I Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS) Apr 2003<br />(a) Unless the requiring activity has obtained prior Senior Acquisition Official (SAO) approval, contractors may not:<br />(1) Provide any service or product with any specification, standard, drawing, or other document that requires the use of a Class I ODS in the test, operation, or maintenance of any system, subsystem, item, component, or process; or<br />(2) Provide any specification, standard, drawing, or other document that establishes a test, operation, or maintenance requirement that can only be met by use of a Class I ODS.<br />[Note: This prohibition does not apply to manufacturing.]</p>
<p>(b) For the purposes of Air Force policy, the following products that are pure (i.e., they meet the relevant product specification identified in AFI 32-7086) are Class I ODSs:<br />(1) Halons: 1011, 1202, 1211, 1301, and 2402;<br />(2) Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs): CFC-11, CFC-12, CFC-13, CFC-111, CFC-112, CFC-113, CFC-114, CFC-115, CFC-211, CFC-212, CFC-213, CFC-214, CFC-215, CFC-216, and CFC-217, and the blends R-500, R-501, R-502, and R-503; and<br />(3) Carbon Tetrachloride, Methyl Chloroform, and Methyl Bromide.<br />[NOTE: Material that uses one or more of these Class I ODSs as minor constituents do not meet the Air Force definition of a Class I ODS.]</p>
<p>(c) The requiring activity has obtained SAO approval to permit the contractor to use the following Class I ODS(s):<br />Class I ODS/ Application or Use/Quantity (lbs.) per contract period of performance<br />[List each Class I ODS, its applications or use and the approved quantities for use throughout the length of the contract. If "None," so state.]</p>
<p>(d) The Offeror/contractor is required to notify the contracting officer if any Class I ODS that is not specifically listed above is required in the test, operation, or maintenance of any system, subsystem, item, component, or process.<br />(End of clause)</p>

<p>&bull; Position Sensitivity Levels:</p>
<p>This contract will entail the following position sensitivity levels:</p>
<p>[ ] Level 6: Public Trust - High Risk. Contractor/subcontractor employees assigned to Level 6 positions shall undergo a Suitability Determination and Background Investigation (MBI).</p>
<p>[ ] Level 5: Public Trust - Moderate Risk. Contractor/subcontractor employees assigned to Level 5 positions with no previous investigation and approval shall undergo a Suitability Determination and a Minimum Background Investigation (MBI), or a Limited Background Investigation (LBI).</p>
<p>[ X ] Level 1: Non-Sensitive. Contractor/subcontractor employees assigned to Level 1 positions shall undergo a Suitability Determination and National Check and Inquiry Investigation (NACI).<br /><br />&bull; The personnel investigation procedures for Contractor personnel require that the Contractor prepare and submit background check/investigation forms based on the type of investigation required. The minimum Government investigation for a non-sensitive position is a National Agency Check and Inquiries (NACI) with fingerprinting. More restricted positions - i.e., those above non-sensitive, require more extensive documentation and investigation.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall submit a roster, by name, position, e-mail address, phone number and responsibility, of all staff (including subcontractor staff) working under the contract who will develop, have the ability to access and/or maintain a Federal Information System(s). The roster shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR), with a copy to the Contracting Officer, within 14 calendar days after the effective date of the contract. The Contracting Officer shall notify the Contractor of the appropriate level of suitability investigations to be performed. An electronic template, "Roster of Employees Requiring Suitability Investigations," is available for contractor use at: http://ocio.nih.gov/docs/public/Suitability-roster.xls .</p>
<p>Upon receipt of the Government's notification of applicable Suitability Investigations required, the Contractor shall complete and submit the required forms within 30 days of the notification.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in advance when any new personnel, who are subject to a background check/investigation, will work under the contract and if they have previously been the subject of national agency checks or background investigations.</p>
<p>All contractor and subcontractor employees shall comply with the conditions established for their designated position sensitivity level prior to performing any work under this contract.</p>
<p>Contractors may begin work after the fingerprint check has been completed.<br /><br />&bull; Investigations are expensive and may delay performance, regardless of the outcome of the investigation. Delays associated with rejections and consequent re-investigations may not be excusable in accordance with the FAR clause, Excusable Delays - see FAR 52.249-14. Accordingly, the Contractor shall ensure that any additional employees whose names it submits for work under this contract have a reasonable chance for approval.<br /><br />&bull; Typically, the Government investigates personnel at no cost to the Contractor. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, justify reduction(s) in the contract price of no more that the cost of the additional investigation(s).<br /><br />&bull; The Contractor shall include language similar to this "HHS Controlled Facilities and Information Systems Security" language in all subcontracts that require subcontractor personnel to have the same frequency and duration of (1) physical access to an HHS-controlled facility; (2) logical access to an HHS-controlled information system; (3) access to sensitive HHS data/information, whether in an HHS-controlled information system or in hard copy; or (4) any combination of circumstances (1) through (3).<br /><br />&bull; The Contractor shall direct inquiries, including requests for forms and assistance, to the Contracting Officer or designee.<br /><br />&bull; Within 7 calendar days after the Government's final acceptance of the work under this contract, or upon termination of the contract, the Contractor shall return all identification badges to the Contracting Officer or designee.</p>

<p><br />STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>1. Introduction and Background<br />The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) owns and operates a Gulfstream IV (GIV) SP SN 1246, registration N49RF. The aircraft is based at NOAA's Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) MacDill AFB in Tampa, Florida and is primarily operated as a high altitude research platform collecting critical data for Hurricane synoptic surveys and Winter Storm Surveillance Missions. This is the only aircraft that is capable of collecting this type of critical data essential for assisting hurricane modelers and track forecasts.</p>
<p>During manufacture, the aircraft was outfitted with standard Honeywell avionics equipment as well as some scientific mission equipment such as the advanced weather radar. Due to the high failure rate of Avionics equipment, it is cost effective and mission critical to have a protection plan. In addition, this service protection plan through financial compensation will enhance the serviceability and operation of all the Honeywell instrumentation, which includes required components of the cockpit display system, flight control system, flight management system, inertial navigation systems, Satellite Communications system, GPS, radar altimeter, and weather radar. All above mentioned systems are required for the airworthiness of the aircraft. This program offers a viable alternative for managing future unscheduled maintenance expenses. As a HAPPS operator, AOC expects to receive replacement units in exchange for any inoperable or malfunctioning Honeywell components in the NOAA GIV. Shipping will also be financially covered under this protection plan.</p>
<p>The NOAA GIV SN1246 has been under the Honeywell Avionics Protection Plan (HAPP) since 2004 and is very satisfied with the service.</p>
<p>2. Scope of Work and Honeywell Obligation<br />The vendor shall be responsible for repairing or replacing Honeywell Avionics Products installed in the GIV SP SN1246 that do not conform to the operational specifications of the particular Honeywell component. This applicable information is contained in the Honeywell component Manual.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and an additional solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation No. DTRT57-12-Q-80002 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) in accordance with FAR Part 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items and FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items. This solicitation document and the incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-53 dated August 4, 2011.
<p>The U.S. Department of Transportation, Research and Innovative Technology Administration, John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center), Cambridge, MA, is seeking to acquire Coherent Doppler Lidars.</p>
<p>Statement of Work:</p>
<p>The Government intends to award up to two (2) contracts on a firm-fixed price basis as a result of this solicitation to qualified businesses, subject to receipt of acceptable quotations. An acceptable quote shall address the required specifications in its entirety. A quote that does not address all required specifications shall be considered non-responsive and will be disqualified. Award will be made to the sources whose quotes, conforming to the solicitation and specifications listed below are determined to be lowest-priced, technically acceptable to the Government. The period of performance for this contract will be from date of contract award (i.e., the effective date) through August 14, 2013. Contract award is planned to be made on or about December 23, 2011. Delivery of the first Lidar unit shall be made within 45 calendar days from date of award. A six (6) month validation/testing period of the delivered first unit shall begin from date of receipt of the first unit. The Government may exercise the option to purchase one (1) additional Lidar unit within a one year period to begin at the end of the validation/testing period. The Coherent Doppler Lidar shall meet the following requirements/specifications:</p>
<p>1. Pulsed Lidar system. <br />2. Eye-safe.<br />3. Minimum horizontal operating range of at least 3km.<br />4. Perform wind profiling measurements with a minimal update rate of once every 10 minutes.<br />5. Perform horizontal or 3D wind profile measurements in 10 minute intervals to an average altitude of 2000 feet. Minimum 50 percent data availability at 2000 feet without ceiling constraints in nominal aerosol loading conditions in major airport environments within the United States.<br />6. Number of samples between range gate centers is selectable.<br />7. Minimum distance between range gate centers is 100 feet or less (i.e., allowing flexible overlapping range gates).<br />8. Number of samples between range gate centers must be independent of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) length.<br />9. 3 dB pulse width is less than 100 nano-seconds.<br />10. Number of range gates is user selectable and is at least 100 range gates or greater.<br />11. FFT length and numbers of zero padding is user selectable.<br />12. For each range gate, the number of spectra to be averaged is user selectable in increments of one.<br />13. System must perform background noise compensation before processed spectra are stored.<br />14. Spectra must be accessible to users and can be saved offline. <br />15. The number of FFT points must be user selectable anywhere in the 16 to 256 range (excluding zero padding).<br />16. A software switch that allows the user to choose whether to store averaged spectra data as well as raw data (I-Q time series for baseband systems/real time series).<br />17. Access to the monitor pulse (MP) either for line of sight (LOS) or averaged LOS, or both.<br />18. Resolve the direction of the Doppler shift along line of sight.<br />19. The measurable LOS wind measurement should encompass the -50 to +50 knots range.<br />20. Minimal velocity resolution of 1 knot. <br />21. Independently document measurement accuracy / uncertainty by comparing it with a tower-mounted anemometer.<br />22. Can be carried and setup by two field personnel with a nominal load per person of 100 lbs.<br />23. The entire system can be transported to a test site with a small SUV or a small pickup truck.<br />24. Nominal power usage less than 700 Watts.<br />25. Can operate on fuel cell for at least a month unattended.<br />26. Documented evidence of unattended operation (when operating from a permanent power source) and/or mean time between basic / routine maintenance of three months or better.<br />27. Capable of scanning in Velocity-Azimuth-Display (VAD) mode with variable elevation angles to obtain horizontal/3D wind profiles.<br />28. Capable of scanning in a Range-Height-Indicator (RHI) mode. <br />29. Networkable with external data storage options.<br />30. Can operate within United States airports environmental ranges of: <br />a. 0F to 95F.<br />b. 0 to 100 percent relative humidity.<br />c. From Sea Level to 7000 Feet/Mean Sea Level (MSL).<br />31. Designed to operate in saline/marine environment - salt erosion resistant.<br />32. At least 0.001 radians scanner vertical resolution, with an accuracy better than .001 radians.<br />33. Continuous or "smear" scan data collection, i.e., the ability to set 3 (Az, El) waypoints with a speed controlled scanner to achieve the angular / vertical resolution stated in requirement no. 32. This is to define the period of an RHI scan with continuous data collection. The same "smear" scan capability shall be carried over to Plan Position Indicator (PPI) scans. <br />34. The system can perform "point and stare" data collection.<br />35. Data collection for both increasing and decreasing elevation angles are needed in RHI mode for wake vortex measurements (i.e., data collection for both upstroke and down stroke of the scanner). <br />36. PPI scan over a 360&deg; range azimuth scan at a fixed elevation angle.<br />37. Zig-Zag scan that involves moving both azimuth and elevation motors together for special aerospace applications such as jet blast and aircraft wake vortex detection of axial flows. <br />38. Storage of backscatter characterization, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) without range corrections and standard deviation of winds.<br />39. Scanner scheduling that allows incorporation of scheduled hard target return as part of the laser system check by the user. <br />40. The azimuth and elevation angles should be reported and stored for each line of sight. This data should be based on actual measurement of the scanner angles and not calculated based on an assumed scanner speed.<br />41. The date/time for each line of sight data should be reported.<br />42. The reported range gate distances shall be corrected prior to the actual emission times of the individual pulses. This must be done on a pulse by pulse basis prior to the FFT and spectral averaging.<br />43. When raw data output is chosen, the system should report and store the time of the first sample for each LOS relative to the emission time of the leading edge of the corresponding pulse. This is required information when raw data is to be reprocessed with accurate range gate distances.</p>

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D.

<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to prepare a feasibility study for a 20 MW grid-connected, hybrid solar and wind power plant in Colombia.</p>
<p>The solicitation for this Study was originally posted on July 21, 2011 and cancelled on August 24, 2011. Please note that several modifications have been made to the original solicitation, as referenced in Amendment No. 1 to the Grant Agreement.</p>
<p>Compa&ntilde;&iacute;a Colombiana de Inversiones, S.A. E.S.P. (Colombian Investment Company or "Colinversiones") requested a USTDA grant for a feasibility study to determine the technical, economic, environmental, regulatory and financial viability of a 20 MW hybrid solar and wind power plant in Colombia. Colinversiones is a publicly listed utility that currently owns and operates, directly and through two affiliates - Colinversiones ZF S.A. E.S.P. (f/ka Termoflores S.A. E.S.P.) and Empresa de Energ&iacute;a del Pac&iacute;fico S.A. E.S.P. - a total of 1,898 MW of electrical generating capacity, making it Colombia's second largest thermal power producer and its fourth largest power producer overall.</p>
<p>This hybrid solar and wind plant will be sized to deliver 20 MW of net power, with approximately 16 MW of wind turbines and 4 MW of solar modules. The Grantee will select the technologies that offer the best combination of energy production, capital cost, operating cost, and financing. The optimization of plant output requires that the size of the solar and wind components be balanced with their expected output under the site's meteorological conditions and in accordance with their relative pricing. The wind and solar resource assessments conducted under this Study will help determine this balance, providing estimates not just of the total wind generation and solar generation but also the degree to which wind and solar outputs are complementary such that their combined output corresponds to the demand peaks and payment schedules.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $592,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA), through milestone payments made by USTDA to the Contractor based on the completion of established deliverables (as set forth in the USTDA Mandatory Contract Clauses in Annex 4).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report, is available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.</p>
<p>To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:<br /><br /><a href="https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp">https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp</a></p>
<p>Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009. In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number. Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.</p>
<p>Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP. Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored. Please check your internal fax verification receipt. Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification. Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day. Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day. Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity. Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country. The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.</p>
<p>Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.</p>
<p>Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by <strong>5 pm on November 7, 2011</strong> at the above address. Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP. Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted. The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals. The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project. The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time frame for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.</p>
<p><br />PROPOSAL EVALUATION: Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum 1:</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent LEC or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer.</p>
<p>The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made by the Contracting Officer. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Provider Capability</p>
<p><br />This factor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b) Price Evaluation. The Government will rank all technically acceptable offers by price. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) Past Performance Evaluation. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. <br />(i) In evaluating the offer, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br />(ii) An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which offer represents the greatest value in accordance with the evaluation criteria contained in this acquisition. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />(iii) The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />(v) The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower.<br />(vi) If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence"<br />performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer.</p>
<p>Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions -- Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition to include the following addendum:</p>
<p>52.212-4 Addendum 1-Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items Mar 2009<br />(e) Definitions.<br />(1) "Common Carrier" means any entity engaged in the business of providing telecommunications services, which are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission or other governmental body.<br />(2)"Noncommon Carrier" means any entity other than a common carrier offering telecommunications facilities, services, or equipment for lease.<br />(3) "Governmental regulatory body" means the Federal Communications Commission, any statewide regulatory body, or anybody with less than statewide jurisdiction when operating under the state authority. Regulatory bodies whose decisions are not subject to judicial appeal and regulatory bodies, which regulate a company owned by the same entity, which creates the regulatory body are not "governmental regulatory bodies."<br />(4) "Special Service" normally involves a common carrier providing a special service or facility related to the performance of the basic telecommunications service requirements. This may include (i) moving or relocating equipment, (ii) providing temporary facilities, (iii) expediting provision of facilities, or (iv) providing specially constructed channel facilities to meet Government requirements. <br />(5) "Telecommunications services" means the services acquired, whether by lease or contract, to meet the Governments telecommunications needs. The term includes the telecommunications facilities and equipment necessary to provide such services.</p>
<p>(i)(3) Payment. IAW FAR Clause 52.232-36(f), Contractor shall submit invoices for certification to the address identified in G-2 of this CSA. After certification, the office identified in G-2 shall provide the Contractor with Government Purchase Card (GPC) information for billing. Payment will be made to the Contractor through a charge to the GPC, at the time and for the amount due in accordance with the certified invoice.</p>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

<DESC><p>Amendment 0005<br /><br />The following questions have been sent by prospective offerors and the Government's responses are below:<br /><br />1. Size stated is 3.75 web X 3.5: At one point it says the 3.75 web<br />includes the exposed liner on each side of the label. At another point it says the actual label size is 3.75. We assume that the 3.75 web includes the standard liner size of 1/8" which would make the label 3.5" X 3.5" with a<br />1/16 inch liner showing on each side of the label. Is this correct?</p>
<p>Response: Yes, that is correct. The line is exposed on each side of the label, the measurement exposed is 1/16th of an inch. <br /><br />2. It is stated that the label MUST be butt cut which means there is<br />no gap in between the labels. It is also stated that there is no black mark on the liner. The printer senses the start of a new label by a gap or black mark on the liner. If the labels were manufactured with a butt cut (no gap) and without a black mark on the liner, the printer would have no way of sensing the start and stop of a label. OR are you sensing based on an entry of the top of form in your printing format? Are you able to print without a black bar or a gap between labels?</p>
<p>Response: The printing is formatted within the application. A perforation is required on the label, the printer may sense the perforation as its stop and start point.</p>
<p>3. A direct thermal label is specified. Direct thermal labels would<br />never be recommended for outdoor applications as they will have a short shelf life.</p>
<p>Response: The printer that we are using requires a Direct Thermal Label, we will manage the shelf life issue as needed.</p>
<p>4. Since you have a spec number for the adhesive, do you have a<br />material spec number for the face stock?</p>
<p>Response: The face stock must be Direct Thermal paper, I do not have a Spec Number for the stock.</p>
<p><br />5. If your labels are butt cut (meaning there is no gap between the labels) you would require the need of a timing mark on the back of the liner so the printer would know when to advance the label. If there is an industry standard of 1/8" between each there is no need for a timing mark or notch, so please advise when you can.</p>
<p>Response: The printing is formatted within the application. A perforation is required on the label, the printer may sense the perforation as its stop and start point.<br /><br />6. Additionally, you have called out for a certain adhesive GB720. Is there a reason for this one adhesive in particular? We had quoted on a very good all-temp adhesive with high initial tact and that is able to withstand a very cold environment. What is the environment that your labels are being subjected to? Furthermore, are you receptive to an alternative adhesive that should always be tested before any order is placed from anyone.</p>
<p>Response: The adhesive that we identified is the adhesive that have proven to work in extreme heat (up to 140 degrees) and cold (below Zero). This is the requirement for any adhesive proposed. Environment the labels are subjected to are inside and outside storage in High Temperature (Arizona, New Mexico), High Humidity (Florida), Cold and extreme cold Temperature (Minnesota, North Dakota).<br /><br />Timeframe for asking question is now over please respond by Tuesday 11 Oct 2011, 4:30 PM Eastern.&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>Change in dimensions previously stated.<br>Test Measurement and Diagnostic Equipment (TMDE)<br><br>The US Department of Defense, Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) purchased a large number of receiver-transmitters and amplifiers under the Consolidated Interim Single Channel Handheld Radio (CISCHR) contract.  Both the Harris Corporation and Thales Communications Inc. were selected.  Tobyhanna Army Depot (TYAD) is seeking interested sources for a synthetic instrumentation system, capable of testing the following CISCHR radios:  AN/PRC-148(V)3, AN/PRC-148(V)4, and AN/VRC-111.  Thales has not released an intermediate level maintenance manual or training class to the public on the (V)3 and (V)4. These radios are arriving back from South West Asia (SWA) and must be tested, in accordance with, Thales practices and procedures for the remainder of the Thales warranty to be honored.  Potential sources must be able to demonstrate that the testing procedure and/or test program is accepted by the Thales and is compliant to their testing criteria.  The system must be capable of generating modulated RF signals in the AM, FM, USB, LSB, BPSK, and QAM; in the frequency range from 1 to 2,000 MHz at an amplitude of 0 dBm.  <br>The system must be capable of generating digital signals in the frequency range from 0.25 to 2000 MHz at amplitudes of 0 to 5 Volts peak. The system must be capable of generating audio signals in the frequency range from 0.100 to 250 kHz at amplitudes of 0 to 3.5 Vrms.  The system must be capable of making RF Power, in watts and dBm,  RF Frequency, RF Frequency Error, RF Receive Signal Strength Indication (RSSI), FM Deviation, AM Modulation, SINAD/Distortion, AF Frequency, Digital Multi-Meter (DMM), Dual Channel Oscilloscope, and RF Spectrum Analyzer measurements.<br>The system must not have a foot print larger than 18 inches wide, 8 inches high, and 22 inches deep; this will provide adequate work space on the remaining space of a 6 foot work bench.  The system must be powered from a single utility power source (115 VAC at 15 amp single phase circuit).  The system's test connections must be accessible from the front face.  Data entry, for accessing the system's features must be through a front panel.<br>The provider must also demonstrate that the test system is currently on the market and can be delivered in approximately 30 days.  The provider must also demonstrate testing capability for the other CISCHR radios from Harris Corporation:  AN/PRC-152, AN/VRC-110, AN/PRC-117F, AN/VRC-103, AN/PRC-150, and AN/VRC-104.  TYAD is in the process of implementing a Failure Reporting, Analysis and Corrective Action System (FRACAS); the provider's solution must demonstrate a means of transferring testing and corrective action data to the FRACAS host computer.<br><br>Interested sources should respond to this office by 19 Oct 11.  <br><br>Point of contact for this action is Ray Molitoris, Senior Contract Specialist (570) 615-7579.<br><br>E-mail your any questions and any technical data for review to raymond.molitoris@us.army.mil.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Pursuant to FAA Market Survey posting of March 25, 2011, and responses received thereto, the FAA has determined competition to be adequate for Requesting Offers and making a subsequent award for the Terminal Automation Systems Independent Data Analysis and Solution Development (IDA & SD) effort.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for Independent Data Analysis & Solution Development (IDA & SD) for the FAA Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System (STARS) and the Common Automated Radar Tracking System (CARTS). These systems collect information from radar and other surveillance sources (including multilateration and Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast Services (ADS-B)), weather sensors, and flight plan information for each aircraft.  Each system integrates the collected data into graphical and textual presentations used by air traffic controllers to safely and efficiently direct aircraft in Terminal Service Areas. These systems are currently operational nationwide at Terminal Radar Approach Control Facilities and Air Traffic Control Towers.  The systems undergo evolutionary and complex software development, often including new and improved functionalities including those for alerts and safety.  The FAA has a continuing need for IDA & SD to ensure that system software evolution continues to allow Air Traffic Controllers to decrease possible accident risks, reduce the number of safety-related incidents, and reduce traffic delays while allowing for inclusion of future software enhancements that meet the challenges of growth and change.

<DESC><p>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst intends to negotiate a contract on a sole source basis with Honeywell, Inc. of South Bend, IN for the design, development, testing, and manufacture of Peculiar Support Equipment and their associated supportability data. This PSE will be used to support the Depot Level of Maintenance requires for the Air Cycle Machine (ACM) and the Shaft Driven Compressor (SDC) of the V-22 Aircraft, at the Fleet Readiness Center, Cherry Pt, NC. This is a multi-system (ACM and SDC) procurement that will meet MV/CV-22 Aircraft maintenance requirements. In addition to the PSE, the Navy also intends to procure one (1) Shaft Driven Compressor, P/N 901-364-002-109; one (1) Inlet Guide Vane, P/N 221020, and one (1) Surge Control Valve, P/N 2210241 to be used as Units Under Test (UUTs). The Inlet Guide Vane and Surge Control Valve are parts of the Shaft Drive Compressor but also need to be procured individually to enable concurrent testing to improve delivery schedule. These exact aircraft components are needed as UUTs to develop tooling and a test system for the Shaft Driven Compressor. The Government does not possess a drawing package that is suitable for competition. The drawings also contain a limited rights legend and a distribution statement E (DOD components only) as per the original contract. Without unlimited rights drawings, we are not able to go out competitively for these items, as the exact aircraft components must be used as UUTs. As the Original Equipment Manufacturer, Honeywell has vast knowledge and experience of the V-22 Shaft Drive Compressor and its components and is the only vendor able to provide the exact required equipment to be used as UUTs for testing. The Navy intends to procure this effort under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(C)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which may be considered by the Navy in determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Navy not to open the requirement to competition based upon the response(s) to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Navy. A solicitation is not available for this procurement. Any challenges must be received within 15 days of publication of this notice and contain adequate support information. Information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for an award of a contract. The Point of Contact is Ms Shannan Germond, Code 2.5.2.2.2, (732) 323-2778. See Numbered Notes 22.</p>

<p><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">The Social Security Administration (SSA) is seeking comments from industry regarding the services outlined in the attached statement of work (SOW). The services are grouped into three areas: </span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">IT Operations and Security,</span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">IT Services Management, </span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">Infrastructure Architecture and Configuration </span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">Please note: This notice constitutes neither a Request for Proposal (RFP) nor a pre-solicitation notice. SSA will neither pay for nor return any information submitted in response to this notice. </span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">The SOW includes general information about the work, as well as 60 distinct tasks for which SSA requires contractor support. Please note most tasks require onsite support at SSA Headquarters in Baltimore, MD. However, certain tasks in the service areas of IT Operations and Security and Infrastructure Architecture and Configuration require onsite support in Durham, NC. </span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">In addition to the SOW, we have posted tables (in .pdf) that include the following information: </span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">Tab 1: This summary sheet shows the hours expended under each task for the last three years and whether there has been an overall increase or decrease in the number of hours expended. </span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">Tab 2: This summary sheet shows the total number of hours expended per labor category, per task, for the last three years. </span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">Tabs 3 through 5: These sheets show a breakdown of the number of hours used by each labor category for each task for the last three years (years two through four of the existing contract.) It is the basis for the summary sheets found in Tabs 1 and 2. </span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">Tab 6: This sheet includes the title of each task. Additionally, this sheet shows what SSA considers a logical grouping of these tasks into the three service areas listed above. At this time, SSA is considering awarding one contract for each of the three service areas. </span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">Of particular interest to SSA are comments from vendors regarding their ability to provide firm-fixed prices for all or some of the 60 tasks described in the SOW. Please let us know your opinion on the following:</span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">1. If we were requesting proposals at this time, have we provided enough information for you to submit an offer on a firm-fixed price basis for all of the tasks in any given service area (i.e., could you provide a firm-fixed price for the performance of all of the tasks in the IT Operations and Security area? For all of the tasks in the IT Services Management area? For all the tasks in the Infrastructure Architecture and Configuration area?)? </span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">2. If your answer to question one is no, please explain why. </span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">3. If your answer to question one is no, do you believe you could propose firm-fixed prices for some but not all of the tasks? </span></p>
<p style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">a. If so, for which could you propose firm-fixed prices?</span></p>
<p style="TEXT-INDENT: 0.5in"><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">b. What additional information, if any, would you need to propose firm-fixed prices for all of the tasks? </span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">We are also interested in your opinion on our grouping of the tasks by service area: are these groupings logical? Would you have considered different groupings? </span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">Finally, we welcome any other comments you may have on the draft SOW. Submit your responses to the contract specialist, Nicole Taylor, using FedConnect (if you are not already registered, go to https://www.fedconnect.net/FedConnect/). If you cannot register in FedConnect, you may email your response to Nicole.D.Taylor@ssa.gov. Please submit your comments no later than 14 October 2011. SSA is not meeting with industry at this time; please do not request such a meeting. </span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">NOTE: We have also published a sources sought synopsis in order to identify small businesses that can provide the services described in the statement of work. Please see SSA-RFI-12-1002.</span></p>

<DESC>The following Amendment is provided and replaces the previous version in it's entirety.&nbsp; Answers to questions have been incorporated in this new version.<br /><br />&nbsp; <br /><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">TACTICAL NIGHTTIME WIDE AREA SURVEILLANCE</span>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">This BAA Topic is directed toward scientific study and experimentation for achievement of a prototype sensor capability that enables tactical nighttime wide field-of-view (FOV) persistent surveillance when deployed on a SHADOW Unmanned Aerial System. &nbsp;The desired sensor capability is intended to achieve surveillance of a wide area with adequate resolution to enable overall situational awareness of moving objects, including vehicles and personnel.&nbsp; It is also intended to achieve enhanced resolution in one or more selected sub-areas of the surveiled area for the purpose of classification and identification of targets and target details. &nbsp;Provided below are a number of parameters that identify desired capabilities for the prototype sensor deployed on a Shadow 200 UAS. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">I.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Background</span></span></p>
<p style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">The objective of this BAA Topic is to support a larger ONR program termed Wide Area Surgical and Persistent Surveillance (WASPS) Capabilities For Group 3/4 UAVs (EMW-FY12-03). The overall goal of the ONR Program is to achieve new sensor and sensor information fusion capabilities to improve battlefield awareness for the Marine Corps and its ability to maneuver and project power by addressing current shortfalls including:</span></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Fielded UAV borne imaging sensors with high resolution, wide field of view, are not nighttime capable</span></li>
<li style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Tactical units at the lowest echelon (team, squad, boat, patrol) now receive little or no timely moderate resolution imagery, which is useful for situational awareness, because they have very few or no organic ISR assets under their control</span></li>
<li style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-list: l1 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Tactical units now receive no timely high resolution imagery useful for identification and/or remote inspection of dismounts</span></li>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">The overall objective of the ONR Program will be accomplished, in part, using small, low cost, highly capable persistent surveillance sensors mounted in Tier II or Tier III class Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) combined with decision support tools to expose enemy networks and vulnerabilities. The effort described herein seeks development of a tactical, nighttime, wide field-of-view (FOV) persistent surveillance sensor with the following desired capabilities: (1) adequate resolution to enable overall situational awareness of moving objects, including personnel and vehicles; (2) the ability to zoom in and achieve enhanced resolution imagery over selected regions of the image for the purpose of classification and identification of targets and target details; (3) <span style="COLOR: black">the ability to perform appropriate pointing and stabilization actions, as well as any needed optical functions for narrow field-of-view; and, (4) the ability to </span>perform the first three capabilities within the size, weight, and power (SWaP) parameters for deployment on a Shadow 200 UAS. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>A more detailed discussion of the desired capabilities for the sensor will be presented below in the Program Design and Performance Goals section of this BAA.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">It is understood that there are a number of difficult research challenges in the pursuit of the desired sensor capabilities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These challenges include that: (1) the sensor may require some mechanical systems; (2) the choice of a visible sensor or an IR sensor, or both, for the narrow field-of-view portion may require a number of tradeoffs concerning the system SWaP; and, (3) in addition to the desired sensor system, other processing and communication resources must be included in the final, combined, actionable intelligence payload on the UAS.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">This BAA Topic contemplates a 4-year research and development activity directed toward achieving&nbsp;a prototype sensor with the desired capabilities described herein.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is anticipated that the program will consist of four phases: a base concept refinement phase (6 months) ending in a Preliminary Design Review; a second phase for detailed system design; a third phase for prototype fabrication and physical integration; and, a fourth six-month phase for electrical and software integration and testing.&nbsp; The phase for electrical and software integration and testing will be conducted jointly with the government at government or civil airport facilities in the greater Washington D.C. area using either a Shadow or a surrogate aircraft depending on availability.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The offeror will work with the government to integrate the sensor with the payload and aircraft.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The offeror will support the government led integration and test effort.&nbsp; Offerors will be expected to propose delivery of a fully integrated and working prototype sensor that meets the Desired Design and Performance Capabilities discussed below within the available period of performance and proposed cost. </span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">This BAA Topic seeks research and development for an MWIR nighttime persistent surveillance sensor payload for center-line installation on a Shadow 200 UAS, flying at a nominal altitude of 12 kft above ground level (AGL).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In the target persistent surveillance scenario, the sensor repeatedly images a wide field of view (WFOV) (~4 km diameter) ground area to produce imagery with a GRD of at least 0.7 m and an effective rate of 2 Hz or higher.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If the approach uses super-resolution with a staring 8k x 8k array, then the ground sampled distance (GSD) goal is 0.5 m at 8 Hz or higher rate and the sensor should have the capability to permit super-resolution processing.<span style="COLOR: black"> The sensor must be capable of providing up to ten user selected video streams (640 x 480 pixels)</span> <span style="COLOR: black">with a GRD of at least 0.7 m at 8 Hz or higher and located within the WFOV.&nbsp; The sensor must provide at least one narrow field-of-view (NFOV) 640 x 480 pixel video stream of a substantially better spatial resolution (Goal:&nbsp; 0.12 m GSD) to support remote inspection of dismounts within the WFOV. &nbsp;In view of the tight 0.12 m GSD goal, concepts based on shorter wavelength sensing will be considered for the 0.12 m stream(s), including the use of active illumination at night.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Achievement of the desired capabilities using a multi-axis gimbal hosting large wide field of view optics and a large format MWIR camera is relatively straightforward.&nbsp; However, the size, weight and power (SWaP) constraints characteristic of a small Shadow 200 UAV are expected to require innovations in any viable developmental approach for this program.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">The program described by this BAA will develop and produce a lightweight capability that functions similarly to a two axis stabilized pointing system that will host the components described above on the Shadow centerline. Stability of the line-of-sight (LOS) is a stressing requirement for a small UAV payload.&nbsp; Roll stabilization / pointing may require a mechanical approach consistent with +/- 15 degrees of travel in both axes to correct for aircraft roll, pitch, and yaw.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Shadow 200 platform roll/pitch/yaw and vibrational environment data is evolving and will be further developed during the program. The initial acceleration and vibration data for the Shadow are as follows:</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">In the standard persistent surveillance scenario, a series of acquire image commands will come in from an onboard sensor management system (SMS) at an appropriate rate.&nbsp; During the exposure, the LOS jitter goal is less than 0.05 mrad rms.&nbsp; For the purposes of this document, jitter is defined as random angular excursions at high frequencies (100 Hz and higher). &nbsp;In addition to the jitter goal, there is a low frequency drift goal of less than 5 mrad/sec.&nbsp; These goals are predicated on a nominal 3 msec image exposure time. &nbsp;These jitter and drift goals, together with a residual image distortion goal, impose a derived goal on the precision and accuracy of the "on-bench" IMU.&nbsp; If a scanning or step/stare approach is considered, a more stringent derived goal is expected to be imposed on the data rate from the IMU so that the above image quality goals can be met.&nbsp; In any case, the minimum IMU data rate goal is 100 Hz. <span style="COLOR: black">The residual image distortion goal is to be compatible with processing multiple frames of imagery and is desired to less than one-fifth of a pixel. </span>&nbsp;In addition to the LOS stabilization goals, when imaging ground (not open water) target areas, the pointing system should be capable of repeatedly pointing the center of the field of view to the same point on the ground with precision (not accuracy) of &nbsp;1.5 m over time intervals of order 100 sec.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">Specific SWaP goals for the sensor payload are:&nbsp;&nbsp; 40 pounds weight, and 200 watts peak power.&nbsp; The size/volume goal is to be compatible with centerline mounting on the Shadow UAV. There is more flexibility with the power goal than with the others.&nbsp;These goals are intended to be consistent with a ~ 10 pound sensor management system (SMS) of 90 cubic inches co-located in the UAV centerline payload space onboard the UAV platform.&nbsp; Existing platform GPS and navigational systems are exclusive of this SWaP budget, however, their output data streams may be available to the proposed payload. &nbsp;If proposed, any high quality inertial measurement system (IMS) on the optical bench must be accommodated within the SWAP budget.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">A significant part of this program will be the integration and testing of the camera and optics with the pointing and stabilization component. &nbsp;The goals for the integrated equipment are as stated below: </span></p>

<p style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">The total weight goal for the integrated payload, except for the SMS and associated processing components, is 40 lbs.&nbsp; Modular design and clear definition of interfaces are also design goals for this program.&nbsp; Certain image processing steps necessary in achieving the image quality, GRD and geo-registration goals may ultimately be executed in the SMS and/or ground station.&nbsp; These include bad pixel compensation, non-uniformity compensation, relative calibration, image formation/formatting, super resolution, data compression, tagging with metrology data, and georegistration.&nbsp; The later operation, to be hosted in the ground station, is critical to achieving the residual image distortion goal.&nbsp; Georegistration performance will be limited by the quality of the metrology data and the details of the image formation scheme.&nbsp; While the SMS and ground station are not covered under this BAA, some of the top level goals (including GRD and residual distortion) depend on operations that will ultimately be hosted there.&nbsp; Consequently, the development work sought under this BAA must include a processing approach and developmental hardware for implementation of the processing steps mentioned in this paragraph.&nbsp; In the course of the work, raw data from the sensor proper will be processed with the developmental hardware to produce corrected, calibrated, georegistered images.&nbsp; These processed images will be evaluated against the goals described above.&nbsp; NRL may elect to rehost some or all of the image processing steps in an SMS payload.&nbsp; The software, hardware and data rights associated with this work must make such rehosting possible.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">The interface between the sensor payload and the SMS co-payload is expected to be based on commands using a standard format , such as XML, and a standard for data format over optical fiber.&nbsp; Data will flow to the SMS in uncompressed form (two bytes per datum) at the rate of 8 full frames per second or higher.&nbsp; The development of the SMS will occur in parallel with the work of this BAA, but is not covered under this BAA.&nbsp; Coordination will be accomplished through technical interchange meetings. Consequently, it will be necessary to design and build a sensor software simulation under this BAA so that smooth sensor / SMS integration can be efficiently accomplished.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">It is anticipated that the government will undertake the airborne test of the prototype hardware that is developed, fabricated and delivered in this effort.&nbsp; A limited amount of support from the organization performing the work of this BAA will be required as part of this project to interface the sensor with the government supplied aircraft, control, data acquisition and dissemination systems.</span></p>

<p>FROM: 673 CONS/LGCZ 24 Feb 2011</p>
<p>SUBJECT: Request for Small Businesses Comments- Incentives (Suspense COB 3 Mar 11)</p>
<p>1. This is not a request for proposal, but a request for comments from Small Businesses to the attached Installation Support Services (ISS) for Geographically Separated Locations (GSL) Draft Award Term Plan. The contract is targeted for Small Business as a Fixed Price with Incentive Firm (FPIF) and Award Term Options resulting in; a contract with a 6 month Base, four 1 year options and five 1 year Award Term Options. Please review the attached documents and provide comments to the following:</p>
<p>a. Does your company have an adequate accounting system for providing data to support negotiations of an incentive price revision (FAR 16.403-1 (c))?</p>
<p>b. Has your company had a successful Accounting System Survey audit conducted by the DCAA for past awarded contracts?</p>
<p>c. Would this contract incentive preclude your company from proposing? If it would, why?</p>
<p>d. Is a ceiling price (Point of Total Assumption) of 5% appropriate for this type of contract risk? Why or Why not?</p>
<p>e. Do you have any other suggested areas for off contract cost reductions?</p>
<p>f. Are the Evaluation Criteria understandable and well defined? Do you have any additional questions and /or need clarification on any parts of the draft Plan?</p>
<p>2. This incentive approach is in response to the DOD's declining funding, changing business practices and is designed to control and lower cost. The incentive plan for this contract consist of two parts: 1) Fixed Price Incentive Firm (FPIF) and 2) Award Terms (AT) for additional five option years. Both require performance standards to be met. The FPIF is designed to provide a positive, calculable profit incentive for the contractor to control costs on an annual basis. The AT targets the reduction of three off contract costs that are within the contractor's control.</p>
<p>3. For additional information about FPIF please refer to FAR 52.216-16 and FAR 16.403-1.</p>
<p>4. Your input is vital to the government's market research of this topic. Please provide responses as soon as possible, but no later than your close of business Thursday, 3 Mar 2011 to both margaret.zerbach@elmendorf.af.mil and stuart.mcelhinney@elemendorf.af.mil.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Government is seeking to lease approximately 21,988 rentable square feet yielding approximately 19,120 ANSI/BOMA square feet of contiguous office and related space in metro Birmingham, AL within the following delineated area:
<p>*Revised delineated area<br />DELINEATED AREA: (See map attachment.)<br /><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Point of Beginning (POB) West Valley Avenue at I 65.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>North on I 65 to 24<sup>th</sup> Ave South.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>West on 24<sup>th</sup> Ave South to Robert Jemison Road.

<p>REQUIRED:<br />Forty Seven (47) reserved parking spaces on site are required for Government Owned Vehicles (GOVs). The agency desires to have the parking spaces for GOVs secured. A ratio of 4.3 parking spaces per 1,000 useable sf is required for employee's personal vehicles. An allocation for visitor spaces is required in addition to employee vehicles and GOVs.</p>
<p>The agency requires space on the ground floor (defined as directly accessible from the parking area without using steps or an elevator). If adequate space is not available on a ground floor, the agency will consider space on upper floor(s) so long as space is contiguous (stacked directly above) and can be accessed by stairs and elevator.</p>
<p>The building site must not be located within a 100-year flood plain.</p>
<p>The resulting lease for this project is for the tenant, the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA). Due to the regulatory nature of MSHA's role over the mining industry, the Agency desires to avoid the appearance of any conflict with the industry, including being housed in facilities owned by a person or persons with any interest in the mining industry. We require that a mine operator or mining business, may not own 49 percent or more of the company or other entity owning the property to be leased. Thus, interested parties with an interest in the mining industry are not invited to submit bids for this project. Any potential offeror who responds to this solicitation is required to submit a signed and dated statement indicating that he or she has NO more than 49% interest in the mining industry.</p>
<p>The agency preference is for existing buildings, located in a commercial district with attractive surroundings. Adaptive re-use of all commercial structures will be considered. All services, supplies, utilities, and tenant alterations are to be provided as part of the rental consideration.</p>
<p>The offered space must meet Government requirements for Fire Safety and Handicapped Accessibility. The Government does not accept sub-leases. Additional special requirements that apply will be addressed in the market survey and the subsequent solicitation for offers.</p>
<p>LEASE TERM:<br />Term is for fifteen (15) years, ten (10) years firm, with the Government having cancellation privileges after ten (10) years.</p>
<p>OWNERS/AGENTS:<br />Submit pertinent information by October 12, 2011 to the following office:<br />Jones Lang LaSalle<br />ATTN: Barbara Jeanneret<br />3344 Peachtree Road, NE<br />Suite 1900<br />Atlanta, GA 30326<br />Barbara.Jeanneret@am.jll.com</p>
<p>All expressions of interest submitted by brokers/agents must be accompanied by written evidence of authorization to represent the building's ownership. Please reference Project Number 8AL2098.</p>

See 'Obtaining Solicitation Documents' below.<br>_______________________________________________________________________________<br><br>Project Description:  (Approx. quantities)<br><br>A Two-bay phase maintenance dock that can fully enclose two B-52s is required to support the missions of two bomb squadrons. For increased mission support, there will be storage for tools in a tool crib, as well as storage for bench stock. Hoists are required over nose and wing areas for routine maintenance requirements. To improve life safety, fall restraint systems are required in the dock areas to prevent maintenance crew injuries. As hazardous materials are present, a waste containment area separate from the bay area is required to store hazardous materials, including an oil/water separator. In addition to the dock space, office space for supervisory personnel, a computer room for maintenance personnel, and locker rooms will be required to support the 24 hours per day, 7 days per week operations. The total area of the facility will be about 87,000 square feet and will include sustainable design features including a geothermal heating and ventilation system. Additionally, to meet the user's requirements, a new parking lot accommodating 100 privately-owned vehicles (POVs) will be constructed to the southeast of the facility.

<DESC>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).<br><br>Contracts awarded in response to this BAA are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the use of competitive procedures IAW FAR 6.102(d)(2)(i). Proposals received in response to a BAA are evaluated IAW FAR 35.016 and the terms and conditions of the BAA through a peer review process.<br><br>Under the PEO STRI Broad Agency Announcement for the Test Resource Management Center, Office of the Secretary of Defense, Test and Evaluation/Science and Technology (T&E/S&T) Program Office, has a requirement to research, develop and verify innovative test and evaluation (T&E) systems for the advanced development of the technologies required to support T&E for the Unmanned Autonomous Systems Test (UAST) Science and Technology (S&T) Test Technology Area (TTA).  As part of a survey of its T&E infrastructure, the Department of Defense has identified the need to develop an innovative stress-testing system for Unmanned Autonomous Systems (UAS) software that uses pseudo-random exceptions to expose failure modes at an unprecedented level.  The system will also create methodologies to interface with software components in an unobtrusive way that will uncover new failure modes that conventional test methodologies cannot detect.  The goal is to develop a methodology that applies across many UAS domains (ground, air, sea, and elsewhere) as well as the software tools to support this methodology.<br><br>
