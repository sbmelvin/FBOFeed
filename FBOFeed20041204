<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, San Diego, intends to award five sole-source contract actions for the development of improved and next generation passive primary portals to detect radioactive materials at entry and nodal points in the national and international commerce and transportation infrastructure.  The intended contract awardees are: Advanced Measurement Technology, Inc. (ORTEC) of Oak Ridge, TN; Ancore Corporation of Santa Clara, CA; Applied Research Associates, Inc. of Albuquerque, NM; Constellation Technology Corporation of Largo, FL; and Northeastern University of Boston, MA.  The contract actions represent a continuation of work initiated by the contractors under the competitive broad agency announcement # BAA 04-02 'Detection Systems for Radiological and Nuclear Countermeasure' issued by the Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency.  Through initial contract efforts, the contractors have begun the critical research and development required to design, fabricate and assemble an Advanced Spectroscopic Portal within the context of a highly accelerated program execution schedule.  The instant actions will provide for a critical design review and subsequent prototype development urgently needed for homeland security.  Use of any other contractors would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that could not be recovered through competition, and unacceptable delays in fulfilling vital national security requirements.  This notice of intent is not a request for proposals.  See notes 22 and 26.
