<DESC>Under the authority of FAR 13.106-3, sole source justification is based on Stryker/Alliant Health Care Products   being the only company supplying these particular items utilized with existing government owned equipment and instrumentation.



1. Description of the supplies and/or services required to meet the end-user's minimum needs:
The clinic requires a titanium CMF plates and screws to {"nate, stabilized, and repair
fractures and defects of patients presented with a wide range of Maxillofacial injuries or
defects. The system shall allows for the performance of procedures on all Cranio Maxillofacial
fractures, Orthognathic and Reconstructive surgical cases. The system shall
be able to be configured for simple or complex cases.
 The system must comprised of
various configuration not limited to a 1.2MM upper face {"nation module, a 1.7MM
midface facture module, a 2.0MM mini plating module, mandible module, fracture
module and a 2.3 reconstructive module. In additional the system must be able compatable with the department's current plating system, the Stryker Leibinger Universal 2 CMF System.


2. Estimated value of the requirement: 


3. Contractor's unique qualifications which make hirn/her the ONLY source that can truly satisfy the Government's minimum requirements:
The OMS clinic current has a Stryker Universal CMF system which requires replacement
CMF plates and screws. Alliant Healthcare Products is the sole source for the distribution
of Stryker products to federal entities.
 If another vendor CMF plates and screws were
chosen the department will be forced to purchase new instrumentation to complement the
system selected.

4. Demonstration of the market search conducted appropriate to the size and complexity of the Government's minimum requirements. Include sources (in Government and industry) contacted and information obtained per source which further supports a sole source acquisition request.:
Synthes Maxillofacial, KLS Martin, Ostomed, and Walter Lorenz offers CMF plating
systems however, these plating systems are not compatible with the Stryker CMF modules
that are currently in use.


5. Other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:
It is imperative from a safety and quality of care that the clinic uses the correct
proprioritary instrumentation for the plates and screws selected.

VISN 22 NETWORK CONTRACTING ACTIVITY
JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
FAR 6.302-1, 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1)

1. Agency and Contracting Activity Identification:

Department of Veterans Affairs Long Beach Healthcare System, 5901 East 7th Street, Long
Beach, CA

2. Nature of Acquisition Being Approved:

Approval is sought for the procurement of Cellient ™ Automated Cell Block System without the full and open competition. The Cellient ™ Automated Cell Block System is a sole source system to be installed in the laboratory. 

3. Description of Supplies or Services to Meet Agency Needs:

Hologic is the sole proprietary manufacturer and domestic distributor of the Cellient™ Automated Cell Block System, the Cellient ™ Package, and all of the Cellient ™ System disposables.  There are no other vendors for the Cellient ™ System and no other vendors offering this unique automated process for creation of cytology cell blocks.

The 2237, 605-10-4-077-0158 description as follows:
1. Cellient ™ automated Cell Block System
Total cost $50,000.

4. Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition:

Only One Responsible Sources and No Other Supplies or Services will satisfy Agency Requirement.

5. Demonstration of the Proposed Contractor's Unique Qualifications or the Nature of the
Acquisition Requires Use of the Authority Cited:

The Hologic is the only company that provides this particular unit described above. The system requires a manufacture's authorized replacement parts and licensures as this complex system's proper operation depends on its components. The Cellient ™ automated Cell Block System is a sole source system to be installed in the laboratory. The Hologic is only known manufacture capable of providing the Cellient ™ automated Cell Block System and proprietary items customized component only available thru the company.

The fully automated process employed by the Cellient ™ System greatly reduces the variability due to operator skill and time required to prepare a cell block.  The filter-based cell capture method ensures that all cellular material collected is transferred to the block.  A single-use consumable ensures there is no cross-contamination between samples, and the shorter processing time increases laboratory efficiency and reduces hazardous waste.  Benefits are highlighted in the table below.
Traditional Methods
"	Quality of cell blocks is highly variable
"	Traditional methods are highly operator dependent and labor intensive
"	Very difficult to capture all cells in a scant sample
"	Less than optimal cellular presentation in cell block - cells "scattered" throughout paraffin
"	
Cellient ™ System
"	Provides a standardized, consistent preparation
"	Fully automated, closed system zero that significantly reduces operator dependency
"	Filter technology ensures cell capture
"	Cells are collected in thin layer and optional eosin contrast aids in sectioning

Each day in cytology the physicians receive fine needle core biopsies, fine needle aspirations, and pleural and ascetic fluids that require cell block preparation.  The current method is suboptimal because a large part of the specimen remains in the paraffin block and is therefore not evaluated.  The Cellient ™ automated cell block system used technology that vacuum filters the specimen and concentrates the diagnostic cells and tissue in the base of the cell block so that higher yield slides may be prepared.  Utilizing this system will decrease our number of non-diagnostic and limited diagnoses because a higher yield of cells will be present to evaluate.  This will decrease the number of repeat interventional CT procedures and follow up open biopsies performed due to non-diagnostic cytology diagnoses.  This will save the institution money and decrease the number of procedures that the patients have to undergo.

6. A Description of Efforts Made to Ensure That Offers From as Many Potential Sources
As Practicable and Whether a Notice Will Be Publicized.

N/A

7. Determination Anticipated Cost Will Be Fair and Reasonable: 

The Hologic develops, manufactures the Cellient ™ automated cell block system and the price quote is discounted catalog price. Based on the information, it has been determined that the anticipated cost is considered fair and reasonable to the Government based on the using service estimate. Hologic does not use any distributors and only source for their products. Anticipated cost for this order is $50,000.

8. Description and Results of Market Research or Statement why Market Research Was
Not Conducted:

Because of the exclusive proprietary license agreement for the items being required, unable to obtain competition or set aside this procurement.

9. Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition:

No other vendor has integrated the Cellient ™ automated cell block system which is essential to the performance of highly qualify, safe diagnostic procedure at the department.

10. List Any Other Sources That Expressed Interest in Writing?

There were no other sources that expressed an interest in this acquisition.

11. A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove of Overcome Any
Barriers to Competition before Any Subsequent Acquisition is required:

Due to Hologic being only source capable of providing the system there are no actions which can be taken at this time to overcome barrier.

12. I hereby certify that the above is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
