The anticipated period of performance of this procurement is a base year beginning 10-1-05 through 9-30-06 with two optional renewal periods of one year each which would make the final expiration of the contract 9-30-08 if all the renewal options are exercised.

<DESC>The Bay Pines VA Medical Center anticipates awarding a sole source procurement to Simplex Grinnell of Tampa, Florida for installing the Executone Care Com II-E nurse call system in the VA Bay Pines Nursing Home sections E and G.  Scope of work includes replacement of existing Dukane Nurse Call system with Executone Care Com II-E Nurse Call system.  New system is a device-for-device replacement, with one additional single patient station located in room D-8 of attached building 101.  Replacement consists of 54 dual patient stations, 13 single patient stations, 56 emergency stations, 2 nurse control stations, 2 nurse follower stations, 1 central equipment cabinet, and all associated peripheral devices, cabling, conduit, back boxes, cover plates, and any other components necessary. Materials for the installation are being purchased through Simplex Grinnel off their GSA contract. Installation will include installing the new main cabinet for the nurse call system in a new room being built by the VA in the dining room.  Disconnect device circuits to the areas being remodeled; demo the existing nurse call panel and install a blank cover over the old cabinet; replace all the existing nurse call devices with new devices one for one in the same locations as the existing. Add a new patient and emergency station in the laundry area connected to area E.  This will have intercom capability. Install a complete raceway system for the new or relocated devices only. Install all wire and cables per Simplex Grinnell requirements. Provide one functional system test with the VA.  Install, terminate, and test all devices.  Install, terminate, and test all panels, sub panels, or remote power supplies required for this project. Install all adapter plates to cover the existing Dukane backbox.

After installation, Simplex Grinnell will thoroughly test and inspect the installation in order to warranty the equipment. NAICS code #238290 applies to this procurement.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.   No solicitation will be issued, however, all quotations received on or before 4:00 PM, EST, August 30, 2005, will be considered by the Government.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce/NOAA intends to negotiate on a noncompetitive basis with Raytheon Company of Upper Marlboro, MD to provide an integrated enhancement to the existing high performance computing (HPC) system being leased by the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) in Princeton, NJ under Contract Number 50-DDNR-0-90030.  The Government intends to modify the existing contract to acquire and integrate additional storage capability and capacity.  The existing HPC system was designed by Raytheon Company to provide a balanced supercomputing environment that includes not only large-scale computing but separate resources for analysis, storage, and networking as well.  The current system consists of a Large Scale Cluster (192 SGI Origin processors and 2688 SGI Altix processors), an Analysis Cluster (196 SGI Origin processors), an HFS/HSMS Cluster (128 SGI Origin processors), and a tape library (5 STK 9310 Powderhorn silos).  Raytheon also provides system administration and other system related support services under the contract.  The current system shares a single integrated set of file systems under SGI’s clustered file system (CXFS) and data archives under SGI’s Data Migration Facility (DMF).  The system’s resources are managed and scheduled primarily by Raytheon’s Grid Engine resource management and scheduling software.  The HPC system currently utilized by GFDL directly supports NOAA’s strategic goals in Climate and Weather and Water by enabling research into the physical processes governing the Earth’s climate and weather.  GFDL is responsible for providing routine, on-demand state-of-the-science model-based global projections of future climate resulting in demands greater than what the current HPC system can provide.

Recent changes to the execution and post-processing of scientific simulations have created a need for additional resources that must be tightly integrated into the existing HPC system architecture to maintain the balance between computational performance, I/O, and storage while maintaining the contractually required high system availability.  While the current total tape storage capacity is sufficient for the expected growth of the data archive, to 7PB by October 2006, recent growth in the size of individual data sets, coupled with intensified analysis of the data, has led to imbalances in the system.  Re-establishing system balance requires increasing the capacity of the tightly integrated disk storage subsystem in order to maximize end-to-end processing performance.  The estimated budget for these enhancements is approximately $750,000 through September 2006.  NOAA anticipates utilizing both acquisitions and leases for the additional hardware, software, and engineering.   Vendors who believe they can satisfy the Government's requirements are invited to submit an affirmative response.  To be considered an affirmative response, vendors must submit written data and documentation which demonstrates an ability to furnish an integrated system enhancement capable of meeting the previously cited requirements.  Seamless integration of the enhancement into the existing HPC system architecture is required, including integration into GFDL’s current hierarchical storage management system.  Of particular concern to the Government is completion of the system enhancement without any interruption or degradation of performance, both during the actual system upgrade as well as during the remainder of the system’s life (through September 2006).  Vendors must include in their response an explanation, in explicit detail, of their plan to implement and manage a seamless integration with the existing HPC system.  All responsible sources must submit a written narrative statement of capability including detailed technical information and other technical literature sufficient to permit agency analysis in order to determine a bona fide capability to meet the requirements.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement for competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within its discretion.  Affirmative responses must be received within 45 days after publication of this synopsis.  SEE Note 22.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) is issuing notice of intent to negotiate a sole source procurement with the University of California at Berkley to provide services for the extraction and amplification of DNA from 2750 West Indies and 783 Gulf of Maine Humpback whale skin samples.  This project is a continuation of field work conducted between the summer of 2003 to the winter of 2005.  The North Atlantic Industry Classification System code is 541690.  The small business size standard is 500 employees.  The Contractor shall provide all labor, equipment, reagents and other supplies necessary to extract and properly preserve DNA from all samples; Delivery of extracted DNA samples to an appropriate NMFS approved storage location on a mutually agreed upon date; A brief progress report due six months into the period of performance describing extraction success to that point in time; and a final report detailing DNA yields from each sample and establishing a disposition date for all samples.  Due to the fact that microsatellite markers have been developed for the particular species and that NMFS has a need to conduct comparative studies using the data from the existing markers, the same suite of markers must be used in multiple studies to maintain the integrity of the data.  The Berkeley lab is the only known existing source of these markers in the world. The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 USC 253 (c) (1), Only One Responsible Source.  Interested parties may identify their interest and must provide evidence of their capability to conduct the DNA extraction and amplification by August 17, 2005.  No other information will be provided.  Telephone requests will not be accepted. Capability statements and supporting documentation may be faxed to (757) 441-3786.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.   Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Numbered Note 22 applies.

<DESC>This requirement is being posted to find vendors to perform preventative maintenance each six months for all compressors, dryers, and filters as identified by serial number and model in the Statement Of Work (SOW). I have also included the Statement Of Work (SOW).

 

STATEMENT OF WORK

2.  SPECIFIC TASKS.  The contractor will conduct all preventive maintenance and inspections at Peterson AFB, and will not remove compressors, dryers, or filters from the base to perform service.  Each unit within the 302d Maintenance Group will provide an area for the vendor to perform the maintenance inspection.  In the event that the vendor requires a larger area than provided, the vendor must request of the 302d Maintenance Group, in advance, the size area required to perform service.  The majority of the service will be performed in the general location where the compressor is located.  

2.1.  The following service requirements per compressor and dryer shall be performed for inspections every six months:
Check the condition of all belts and adjust the tension of all belts
Check the condition of starter contacts and clean
Check and record control panel parameters and warning shutdown history
Check operation of system
Record running amps and volts

2.2.  The following additional service requirements per compressor and dryer shall be performed for preventive maintenance every six months:
Adjust controls, wipe off any oil leaks and tighten as required
Change oil and air filter
Change separator element and coolant every 8000 hours or two years, whichever comes first, unless the differential gauge reflects that the separator needs to be changed

3.  WORK CONTROL 
  
The vendor will coordinate maintenance service with the 302d Maintenance Group POC in sufficient time for an area to be prepared to conduct the maintenance, and to allow disruption in the work area(s) to be kept to a minimum.

<DESC>Issue date: 27 APR 2005. Miltope TP2000 Printer. This is a microcomputer controlled, high speed, thermal printer that uses 4 1/2 inch wide paper rolls. Sole source: Cage: 54418, Miltope Corporation, 3800 Richardson Road South, Hope Hull, AL 36043-4022
Sole source provide justification: Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(C)(1), Justification: Supplies (or Services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The proposed contract is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the proposal.  However, the Government will consider all proposals received prior to the closing date on the solicitation.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Specifications, plans, or drawings relating to the procurement described are incomplete or not available and cannot be furnished by the Government.  The Government does not own the data or the rights to the data needed to purchase this item from additional sources.  Sole Source: Miltope Corporation, 3800 Richardson Road South, Hope Hull, AL 36043-4022.  Miltope is the Original Equipment Manufacturer.  The current printer being used requires a unique type of paper which is almost out of stock and is no longer manufactured.  This has made it necessary to pruchase these newer printers that are compatible with the Re-entry System Test Set (RSTS) for the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Weapon System.  Any change in printer design would necessitate an extensive engineering effort to fit a new model of printer into the A15 rack and to interface a new printer with the RSTS computer.  There are no identified alternatives to this Miltope printer model. Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation.

The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the sam relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: “See Note 22”

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command intends to procure five Acoustic Rapid Commercial Off-the Shelf (COTS) Insertion (A-RCI) “Delta” kits to upgrade existing (complete and partial) systems, with associated delta pre-cable kits and delta spares.  Two of the kits will upgrade SSN systems to SSBN (Trident) systems, one kit will upgrade a partial SSBN system to a full SSBN system, another will upgrade a partial system for SSN21 (SEAWOLF), and the fifth will convert a Phase II/III System to a Phase III System.  A-RCI is a sonar system upgrade that integrates and improves towed array, hull array, sphere array, and other ship sensor processing, through rapid insertion of COTS based hardware and software.  A-RCI has already been successfully integrated into SSN688, SSN 688i, and SSBN 726 Class Submarines.  NAVSEA has determined it is in the government’s best interest to solicit this effort from Lockheed Martin Corporation, Naval Electronics and Surveillance Systems (LMNE&SS) in Mana! ssas, Virginia.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>NCD is an independent federal agency established to review and report on national disability policy, programs, practices and procedures. NCD's National Disability Policy: A Progress Report is required by Section 401 (b)(1) of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended. The report typically uses, as benchmarks, the recommendations for change made by disability leaders from throughout the country and captured in the 1996 NCD document Achieving Independence. Those recommendations--elaborated upon in the ensuing annual Progress Reports--reflect a wide array of public policy areas designed to advance inclusion, empowerment, and independence of people with disabilities of all ages from diverse backgrounds consistent with the vision of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA).
The expected report will cover the period December 2004 through December 2005. It will review federal policy activities by major issue areas, note progress where it has occurred and make further recommendations where necessary. The recommendations apply to the executive and legislative branches of the Federal Government. In addition, the expected report will follow-up on, and will update, the recommendations for change offered by NCD in its National Disability Policy: A Progress Report to be published in the fall of 2005
The contractor will prepare one (1) document for the NCD. The outline and format of the document will closely follow the convention of those from previous years. The major change in the report will be the addition of content regarding status of recommendations made by NCD in its previous Progress Report. The contractor will work directly with Martin Gould, NCD Director of Research and Technology, to: (a) articulate the [re]design of the report, (b) interact with NCD Board Members and staff members, as necessary, and (c) interact with other government agencies and staff, as necessary. 
The estimated contract period is 8 months. NCD will distribute its National Disability Policy  Request for Proposals (RFP) to interested parties on August 26, 2005. NCD will expect interested parties to submit their responses by September 26, 2005. Copies of the RFP may be requested by mail or picked up at NCD on or after the issue date of August 26, 2005. All requests must reference the RFP number and title. For more information, contact Martin Gould, mgould@ncd.gov, 1331 F Street, NW, Suite 850, Washington, DC 20004; 202-272-2004 or 202-272-2074 TTY.

The Government will issue a sole source modification to Contract No. NNK05LA81P awarded to SwRI for “Centerline Generic Nutation Study, Phase II.”	 The purpose of this test is to define the one-g lateral slosh parameters and to identify the one-g natural frequencies of spacecraft fuel tanks.  The test articles to be used for this test are the test tank, diaphragm and dynamometer developed for the STEREO mission.  These test articles are currently located at Southwest Research Institute. SwRI has the unique expertise as the design agency and developer of the Spinning Slosh Test Rig (SSTR) to successfully implement the described tasks.	SwRI possesses unique test equipment and software, including a long lead Stereo tank simulator and analytical models that have been validated to the test facility.	SwRI has successfully generated critical data in support of three NASA expendable launch vehicle missions; GENESIS, CONTOUR, and STEREO.  SwRI generated the design concept for the SSTR, built the SSTR, and performed all of the required strength and failure modes and effects analyses to support the operation of the SSTR. SwRI has successfully used the SSTR to generate critical data in support of three NASA expendable launch vehicle missions; GENESIS, CONTOUR, and STEREO. The NASA-owned SSTR that SwRI developed, built and tested is the only one of its kind in the aerospace industry. Due to the uniqueness of the SSTR, it is the only existing hardware that can meet the requirements of this task, and SwRI has unique expertise to perform the test and analysis. Previous research was performed during the concept study phase of building a spin test facility, and SwRI was determined to be the only organization that could meet the technical and schedule requirements in support of the GENESIS mission. With the hardware built, tested and operated in support of  previous NASA missions, it is obvious the SSTR is the only asset that can satisfy the requirements of this task. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on August 17, 2005.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.  Offers may be emailed to:  Tina.M.Landes@nasa.gov by the time and date set for closing (8/17/2005 not later than 4:30 p.m.).   An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is issued as a Notice Of Intent; NOI5094.  This NOI is not a small business set aside.    This solicitation and its incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 05-03.  This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 325414 and the small-business size is 500.  SCHEDULE:  The NIAID is soliciting quotations from offerors to acquire 
large scale production and purification of several selected humanized IgG antibodies against dengue and other flaviviruses, including West Nile virus and Japanese encephalitis virus.
The objective is to use the purified IgG antibodies for functional characterization in vitro and in vivo for our on-going mouse and monkey protection studies.  The contractor will perform the following to produce and purify several selected humanized IgG antibodies, using our own one-plasmid system for transient transfection of mammalian T293 cells.  A total of seven IgG antibodies will be produced from their respective plasmid.  We expected to obtain 10-50 mg of highly purified IgG antibody, each.  Seven plasmid constructs are designated as follow: pIgG 1A5 –dA; pIgG 1A5-dB; pIgG 3E4; pIgG 1A10; pIgG A3; pIgG MAB2; pIgG IIIE3.
The contractor will use a 10-L culture of T293 cells for production and purification of each monoclonal antibody. The yield is expected to be in the range of 10-50 mg of IgG antibody each.
The contractor will provide a written report of the data analysis.  The contractor is required to keep all data confidential and to provide written reports and/or recommendations at the request of NIAID.  The Laboratory of Infectious Diseases (LID), DIR, NIAID, with its extensive work in the area of vaccine development, including preclinical and clinical trials, has need for large scale production of purified IgG antibodies for functional characterization and analysis of protection against virus challenge in animals. Highly potent antibodies against provide an alternative for protection against infection. The LID is currently involved in the design and implementation of a number of trials of candidate vaccines against respiratory, gastroenteric, hepatitis and arthropod-borne viruses. In the absence of skilled statistical advice, inappropriate trial design or analysis could result in the emergence of incomplete data or of misleading conclusions. For example, the sample size could be too small to detect differences, or post hoc analysis could result in false conclusions.  The selected contractor is proposed to provide NIAID with the proper quantities of IgG antibodies to be used in our on-going in vitro functional characterizations and animal protection studies. The contractor has been used in the past and has developed a protocol for cultivating suspension cell lines in scalable systems, suitable for this production. This company has a long history of expertise in IgG antibody production and purification, specific knowledge regarding the design, monitoring of products, conduct and production of such a bioreactor. 
The contractor has produced 1A5 and 5H2 IgG antibodies for our lab in the past with excellent results. Therefore, they have the specific knowledge of our products and how they need to be handled to optimize production and purification.  Changing variables at this time would prevent correct interpretation of the experiment(s) in progress (FAR 6.302-1) Project No. AI 000682-15.
 The following Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition:  FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Item; FAR 52.212-3 Offerors presentations and Certifications-Commercial Items  ; FAR 52.212-4 Contractor Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items;  FAR 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes of Executive Orders–Commercial Items; and FAR 52.204-7 Central Contractor Registration (www.ccr.gov).

<DESC>Background

CMS must estimate improper payments in the Medicaid program as directed by the Improper Payments Information Act of 2002 (IPIA).  To implement error rate measurement in Medicaid, CMS will use a national contracting strategy.  Under this strategy, CMS will engage three contractors: (1) a statistical contractor; (2) a documentation/database contractor; and (3) a review contractor.  The statistical contractor will perform all statistical, sampling and error rate calculation functions.  The documentation/database contractor will gather medical policies and other necessary information from States; will maintain a database of the medical policies (along with quarterly updates to these policies) and will gather medical records from providers.  All information collected by the contractor will be maintained in electronic format.  The review contractor will perform the data processing and medical reviews in those States selected for review.  For Fiscal Year (FY) 2006, all three contractors will exchange information and will work together to produce the Medicaid fee-for-service (FFS) error rates.  CMS anticipates a separate contract for each of these contractors.  
Description
A sole source contract is contemplated for award to Lifecare Management Partners (Lifecare) to provide documentation and data warehousing services needed to help produce national and state-specific Medicaid FFS error rates for FY 2006.  These duties include collecting and maintaining medical records and state policies, and creating the corresponding database to house the collected information.

Lifecare serves as the Medicare Comprehensive Error Rate Testing (CERT) documentation contractor.  Because Lifecare has past experience through its work with CERT, it has highly specialized knowledge and developed technology to request and maintain medical records documentation.  The tasks that are required to produce an error rate are detailed and time consuming to design and launch.  Lifecare’s established hardware, software, and collection procedures, as well as its demonstrated approach to capturing requirements of users and quickly customizing its applications and technical procedures to accommodate their needs, make Lifecare the only company capable of performing the tasks within the required timeframes.  In addition, start-up costs related to secured communication lines and the establishment of necessary technical mechanisms have already been consumed through the CERT contract; therefore, the economies of scale are significant.  

In order to produce an error rate in a timely manner, a contractor would need to begin operation prior to the 2006 fiscal year. The CERT startup and design period was six (6) months.  Due to CMS business requirements, valuable time and expense would be lost in locating and renting appropriate facilities and purchasing and installing the necessary hardware and software.  CMS believes that Lifecare is in the best position to further CMS’ ability to produce a national error in a timely manner with minimal risk to the government.

This sole source procurement is being conducted pursuant to the authority of 41 U.S.C. § 253(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), that only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency’s requirements.  CMS believes Lifecare Management Partners is the only company that can provide CMS with timely and accurate technical support that will allow CMS to implement the Medicaid FFS error rate program in a timely manner.  This contract will be awarded for a period of 24 months with no optional years.  

This is a notice of intent and not a request for quotations.  Businesses that recognize and can provide the required service described above must provide supporting evidence. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.   The Government will consider all responses received NLT 3:00 PM EDT, 24 Aug 2005. Responses shall be submitted to Monica N. Carter.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541519   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) intends award a sole source, fixed price purchase order to Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC Inc.) for the preservation of EPA'S EPAYS historical information. EPAYS was EPA's Personnel/Payroll System from February 1984 to October 2004. In October 2004, a new COTS-based system, PeoplePlus, replaced EPAYS as EPA's payroll/personnel production system. All payroll and personnel transactions processed during the year from October 2003 though October 2004 has been loaded into the new system. However,  there is no vehicle to transfer older historical payroll and personnel information from the EPAYS file system to the new payroll/personnel system. SAIC's specialized contractor support is needed for the following services:  1)	Convert historical information form the EPAYS Master File into the XML  files in order to keep the data available for future use by other EPA payroll and personnel applications.  2)	Continue hotline support for EPAYS-related issues, including printing retirement cards from the EPAYS Master File, generation of ad-hoc reports with the EPAYS historical information, and  resolving matters with past EPAYS transactions as requested by EPA Payroll or Personnel Office or the TOPO/ATOP's. 3)	Recreate EPA retirement flat files prepared by OPM according to the latest file layout and updated requirements submitted by OPM.  The current SAIC assigned personnel have worked  on EPA's application for several years and therefore have a thorough and in-depth understanding, as well as, a historical knowledge of EPAYS and its support systems.  Historically, newly assigned (but experienced) SAIC developers have taken several months to learn the functionality, programming,  and structure of EPAYS and its support systems.  Allowing a new contractor to commence efforts for this requirement would jeopardize EPA's progress with the President's Management Agenda initiatives mandated by the Office of Personnel Management and, overall, would not be in EPA's best interest.  In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 235(c)(2) and FAR 6.302-1, there is only one responsible source that can perform the required services.  The period of performance is expected to be from August 2005 - September 2006. The award to SAIC Inc. is not expected to exceed the amount of $35,000.00.  NO  SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE. However, any firm who believes they can provide the required services may submit a response, which if received 10 calendar days of this announcement will be considered. Responses to this posting must be in writing. A determination not to compete  the proposed requirement based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All inquiries should be directed to Marisol Ventura via email at ventura.marisol@epa.gov. Telephone requests or inquiries will not be accepted.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541990   Under the authority of  FAR 13.106-1(b), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with MacDonald Environmental Sciences Limited (MESL) to provide technical assistance for the ecological risk assessment, field oversight, and review of Federal Court directed deliverables associated with the Anniston PCBs Site. PCBs were produced at the former Monsanto plant (Facility) in Anniston, Alabama from 1929 through 1971.  Solutia Inc., the present Facility owner, was created in 1997 as a spin-off of Monsanto.  The U.S. EPA's  Environmental Response Team (ERT) has been sampling this site since 1999 and has found that PCBs have migrated away from the Facility as a result of surface water transport.  Solutia began sampling residential properties as specified in an agreement with EPA (the Time- Critical Removal Order) in  May of 2001.   A Partial Consent Decree (PCD) for the Site was entered by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama on August 4, 2003. The Partial Consent Decree requires Solutia to continue work under the Time Critical Removal Order and begin a Non-Time Critical Removal  (NTC) and a Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study (RI/FS). The NTC Removal Action is being used at the Anniston PCB Site to achieve immediate risk reduction on residential properties not addressed by the Time Critical Removal Order while the RI/FS is completed and the final remedy is  selected. Within the PCD, the Court has outlined a schedule of the investigation and deliverables.

<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality through the Division of Acquisition Management (DAM), Program Support Center (PSC), intends to award an eighteen (18) month sole source contract using simplified acquisition procedures to the American Hospital Association (AHA), Washington, DC.  The anticipated date of award is August 30, 2005.  

AHA is unique in that it represents and/or has partnerships to all hospitals in the United States that has both a national and state infrastructure, and a mission and commitment to quality improvement and patient safety at its member hospitals.  The AHA/HRET has a Leadership Center that will be key to the success of this contract, and AHA/HRET is developing a Quality Center which will also be key to the success of activities slated under this contract.  In addition, the key personnel within AHA have unique experience and in-depth knowledge of hospitals, quality and patient safety issues, strong relationships with hospital leadership as well as experience in planning and implementing programs in the areas of quality and patient safety.  AHA is the only organization that the Government is aware of that can mobilize its members and will have a dedicated Quality Center to facilitate these quality improvements.   

Under this contract, AHA will (1) identify the knowledge, expertise and support that hospital leader—both CEOs and institutional leaders in quality and patient safety—need to implement strategies to improve patient safety to sustain these improvements.  (2) identify current effective formal or informal support systems for chief quality officers, and strategies to strengthen these support systems. (3) Identify ways to support and/or accelerate the successful completion of current hospital quality improvement initiatives. (4) Identify what the most effective role that AHRQ and AHA might play as partners with chief quality officers and hospital leaders to support the improvement of quality and patient safety. (5) Based on the knowledge from the focus groups and input from major stakeholders, design a strategy focused on hospital chief quality officers that will support and accelerate quality improvement and patient safety, and implement an initial set of activities to further the aims of the strategy. (6) Having a clear articulation of the knowledge, expertise and support needed to help hospitals more rapidly and effectively implement quality improvement, it will help AHRQ and AHA to know what they can do given the resources of their organizations.   A second phase of this proposal is to pilot test our ability to provide the needed knowledge or support.  AHRQ and AHA will use the results of the first phase of this study to design a prototype intervention that would meet one of more of the identified needs and pilot test it, and gather hospital and clinical quality leaders’ reactions to it.  

The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with a single source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b).  Interested parties capable of responding to the requirement may submit a capability statement specifically identifying their ability to accomplish this requirement.  Responses are due within 10 days after publication of this notice.  Responses shall be reviewed solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition following consideration of responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  A written solicitation is not available.

Support generally the Departments statutory responsibilities to pay physicians accurately for the services they provide to Medicare beneficiaries.  Define the conceptual issues that must be addressed in developing a measure or measures of physician productivity.  Update work previously commissioned by CMS to develop a health sector specific model of physician productivity.  Determine if a more refined measure of physician productivity could be applied to the Medicare Economic Index and to see what effect such a measure would have on the current methodology of determining the annual update to the physician fee schedule in Medicare.  Determine whether a health-sector model of physician productivity can be substituted for the economy wide measures currently obtained from the Bureau of Labor statistics in the current Medicare physician payment system and to determine whether there are adequate sources of data to sustain a health sector-specific model of physician productivity.

Joseph Newhouse is a national expert on multifactor productivity (MFP) for the physician services industry and has demonstrated expertise in the following areas:  the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) methodology for multifactor productivity; the Medicare Economic Index (MEI used to recommend updates for Medicare physician payments by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and the Medicare Payments Advisory Commission (MedPAC); and the various measures or indicators of productivity for physicians services used in the physician services industry and/or academia.  National technical expertise to discuss the pros and cons of various measures of productivity for the purpose of updating Medicare payments within the context of the MEI.  Joseph P. Newhouse, John D. MacArthur Professor of Health Policy and Management, is Director of the Interfaculty Initiative on Health Policy and Director of the Division of Health Policy Research and Education, which administers the PhD program in Health Policy at Harvard, and Chair of the Committee on Higher Degrees in Health Policy.

<DESC>UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT
NOTICE OF INTENT TO LEASE SPACE
USING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
MIAMI, FLORIDA



The United States Government intends to award a lease extension using other than full and open competition to Koala Miami Realty Holding Co., Inc. The extension will be for 38,274 rentable square feet of fully serviced space for a term of eighteen months.

The Government has a continuing need for this space until such time as a new lease can be awarded. It has been determined that an extension will result in less cost to the federal government when economies of moving, telecommunications, security, and duplication of tenant improvements are taken into consideration as an economic factor.

Firms who are interested in commenting regarding the government’s intent to award this project under Other than Full and Open Competition or in obtaining additional information regarding the above procurement should provide their written comments to Glynda Grieve, Contracting Officer, at glynda.grieve@gsa.gov or to her attention at GSA, Property Acquisition & Realty Services Division (4PEC), Atrium West Building, 7771 West Oakland Park Boulevard, Suite 119, Sunrise, Florida 33351. Any written comments are to be received within 15 days of the publication of this notice.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

------------------------------------------------------------------


A) Overview

The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) requires contract personnel to support the Engineering Department by performing a variety of Engineering  related functions including, but not limited to, technology development, application, planning, analysis, design and acquisition management and integrated life cycle support  planning, maintenance and environmental management, and software management in support of USPS operational and financial goals. The services required deal primarily with experienced technical and management specialists who are capable of performing in a professional environment in support of the systems and technology transforming the USPS into a world class 21st Century business.

Currently Engineering uses over 150 contract persons in numerous labor categories, funded by various different financial accounts, and it is anticipated that these figures will remain viable for the duration of the initial contract term.  However, the USPS may increase or decrease the number of contract personnel at any time, and there is no guaranteed minimum number of contract employees that must be maintained.

Most contract employees are domiciled at the Engineering offices in Merrifield, VA or some specific supplier’s facility.  Depending upon assignment, some contract employees may travel extensively throughout the United States.  Some assignments may require less or more than 40 hours per week.  A five-day workweek is contemplated for most assignments.  No minimum workweek is guaranteed.  

The supplier must be able to perform recruiting, managing, invoicing, and reporting tasks as a minimum.  Training shall be provided as necessary by the supplier in order to meet and maintain personnel requirements.  

B)  Required Supplier Criteria and Other Information

The USPS intends to pre-qualify respondents capable of providing an innovative and commercially available technical staffing and management services. Respondents included in any subsequent pre-qualified group may be invited to participate in follow-up pre-qualification processes, a discovery process, Reverse Auction or to provide proposals in response to the USPS Request for Proposal.  However, the USPS reserves the right to terminate this process if it is deemed that the availability or maturity of the commercial solutions does not fit the current need or vision of the USPS.  Responding to this notice does not guarantee pre-qualification or participation in future USPS activities. The USPS may make one or more awards to support this activity.

C)  Selection Process

The USPS decision to pre-qualify respondents is a business decision of the USPS Purchasing team.  Pre-qualification does not constitute an award.  Pre-qualification will be based on a composite of all responses, not any single item, that demonstrate a respondent’s capability to provide an innovative and commercially available technical and management services.  All qualified respondents may not be placed in the pre-qualified group if the purchase team determines that a smaller group may provide adequate competition or that some respondents are considerably more qualified than others, thereby precluding opportunities for others less qualified.  Respondents whose responses to this notice indicate that their solution is (1) not commercially available, (2) beyond the current or immediate experience level or resources of their firm, or (3) deemed unrealistically incompatible with the USPS environment and vision, may not be considered for pre-qualification.

D)  Notification to Selected Suppliers

The contracting officer will notify all respondents of their pre-qualification status.  The list of pre-qualified candidates will be publicized.

E)  Request for Information Instructions

1.	At least two years in the temporary technical staffing services business.
2.	Key personnel including recruiters to have quality professional qualifications.

<SUBJECT>30 -- Rectifier Transformers for the AGS Main Magnet Power Supply
<SOLNBR>AGSTXF1
<RESPDATE>090905
<ARCHDATE>09242005
<CONTACT>David Paveglio, Contracts Administrator, Phone 631-344-8461, Fax 631-344-5499, Email dpavegli@bnl.gov
<DESC>Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) operates a fully controlled 72 MW DC power supply, which energizes the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS) Main Ring Magnet system.  The Magnet system represents a 0.75 Henry, 0.25 Ohm load.  The controlled rectifier assembly is feed from a 95 MVA Motor Generator Set through eight phase shifting / step-down rectifier transformers.  The secondaries of each of these transformers are bifilar wound, so that there are 16 secondary windings in total.   BNL will solicit bids to replace the existing rectifier transformers with new units.  It is critically important that the prospective Vendor have extensive experience with rectifier transformer of this size and service and a thorough understanding of how these transformers interact with the Motor Generator set.  The prospective Vendor shall insure that the new Transformers are completely compatible with the existing rectifier modules and the Motor Generator Set.  The Vendor shall build and thoroughly test and document the transformers.  BNL will install the transformers with engineering supervision by the Vendor.  The Vendor shall participate in the commissioning and turn on of the systems after the new transformers are installed.

Operating Parameters:
The Transformers will be operated 24 hours per day 7 days per weeks 10 months per year.  The operating cycle will drive the rectifiers to full rectify and then to full invert continuously with a repetition rate of from 1 cycle per second to 1 cycle in 10 seconds.  During each cycle power will flow from the transformers to the magnet load and then from the magnet load back through the transformers to the Motor Generator Set.  In one typical cycle the DC current will rise from 200 amperes to 6000 amperes in 500 milliseconds and then immediately return to 200 amperes in an additional 500 milliseconds.  This cycle will repeat every 1.1 seconds.  In another cycle the current will rise from 200 amperes to 4500 amperes in 500 milliseconds and stay at 4500 amperes for 6 seconds and then return to 200 amperes in 500 milliseconds.  This cycle will repeat every 9 seconds.  The transformers must be designed and braced to handle this service, including the harmonics generated by the rectifier modules.  The transformers must fit the footprint of the existing transformers.  Any modifications required to the existing transformer yard will be prohibitively expensive.   

Specific requirements for the transformer are:
1)  		Eight phase-shifting / rectifier transformers each with bifilar secondary windings.  These transformers will be housed in four tanks suitable for outdoor service.
2)		Four transformers shall be rated at 7500 volt (input), 431 volt (output), 2.65 MVA.  These shall have appropriate phase shifting for 24 pulse rectifier operation.
3)		Four transformers shall be rated at 7500 volt (input), 2288 volt (output), 11.5 MVA.   These shall have appropriate phase shifting for 24 pulse rectifier operation.
4)      Four transformers will be connected via cable and four will be connected via circular aluminum bus.
5)		The lower power rated transformers will have no load manually selectable taps at 100%, 90% and 80 %.  These will be full current taps. 
4)       Delivery of the transformers shall be within 10 months after receipt of order.

This Request for Proposals (RFP)will be a Best Value with trade-offs procurement based upon price and other factors.

This RFP will be sent to the following  contractors:

FROM 6 CONS/LGCA

SUBJECT:  	Answers to submitted questions – MACDILL AIR FORCE BASE COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY TRAINING PROGRAM

1.	The following are questions and answers received as of 10 AUG 2005.

Question 1:	Sec 7.2 Contractor is required to provide a class roster to facility point of contact at least 30 days prior to class start.  Contractor anticipates that many classes will be offered each month.  Some will last for several hours, while others will last for several weeks.  We would like to be able to register participants right up to the time class starts if there is still space available.  Is it possible to continue to add to the roster once it is provided to the facility point of contact? Answer:  The Government sees no problem with this.  It basically would be the responsibility of the contractor to ensure the facility POC has a current listing, updating on an on-gong basis as needed.
 
Question 2:	Sec 9.4  Is contractor expected to offer a normal schedule of youth courses during the periods when Cybercamps are being run?  We would like to have our youth staff also be involved in Cybercamps if possible? Answer: Yes, not all youth may want toparticipate in the cyber camps sowe would want access to on-going youth courses.
 
Question 3:	Equipment - 	
a.	Will computers in each location be available solely for use with this program or be shared with other program? Answer: During the identified times of the on-line technology program they would be exclusively used by this program.  This program will always have first priority.
b.	Will computers be available to users when contractor staff is not present?  Answer: Yes, computers will only be available for other users when not in use to support this program.
c.	How is it anticipated that accountability for equipment will be maintained by contractor if equipment will be used without contractor personnel present? Answer: Contractor will establish an accountability system with facility POC that is mutually agreeable.  If a mutual agreement can not be reached, then the technology program may possible retain exclusive use.

Question 4:	Will it be possible to run any youth programs, including Cybercamps or clubs at Building 4 – Brandon?  Answer: Yes, however, they will have to be coordinated with the facility POC and can not reduce or compromise the services being provided at the primary youth facilities.  These would be in addition to not in place of.
. 

Question 5:	Sec 13 requires that equipment be turned over to government in ‘new condition’ at end of contract.  Turning the equipment over in ‘appropriate’ or ‘working’ condition might be more realistic.  Answer:  New condition may be able to be further defined as in “best working condition” for the age of the equipment.

Question 6:	What is the implementation timeline for setup of the furniture and equipment in each lab?  Answer:  This can be negotiated based on the requirements at each facility to determine a timely implementation.

<DESC>NOTICE OF OPPORTUNITY FOR CLINICAL TRIAL COLLABORATION

UTILIZATION OF MID-URETHRAL SLINGS, RETROPUBIC AND TRANSOBDURATOR SLING PLACEMENT DEVICES IN A NIH SPONSORED MULTI-CENTER CLINICAL TRIAL IN WOMEN WITH STRESS URINARY INCONTINENCE.

ONLY THE SUBMISSION DATES HAVE BEEN MODIFIED


The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) seeks collaboration with industry to provide mid-urethral slings and retropubic transobdurator sling placement devices in a NIH-sponsored multi-center clinical trial in women with stress urinary incontinence. 

INTRODUCTION:  	The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease (NIDDK) is planning to conduct a randomized controlled clinical trial to evaluate and compare approaches (retropubic and transobturator) for surgical treatments of stress urinary incontinence in women. The trial will be conducted by investigators participating in the Urinary Incontinence Treatment Network (UITN). The two-arm trial will enroll approximately 500 women and have equal randomization to two surgical approaches, either a retropubic mid-urethral sling placement approach or a transobturator mid-urethral sling placement approach. Enrollment is expected to be completed over 2 years with follow up of a minimum of 24 months and as long as 48 months. Enrollment will occur at nine participating clinical centers (William Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak, Michigan; Loyola University, Chicago, Illinois; University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama; University of California at San Diego; University of Maryland, Baltimore, Maryland; University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, University of Texas at Dallas; University of Texas at San Antonio, and the University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah). It is possible 1-3 additional centers will be added.  Central data collection and analysis will occur at the NIDDK funded Data Coordinating Center at the New England Research Institutes, Watertown, Massachusetts.

STUDY GOALS:  The primary aim of this randomized clinical trial is to compare objective cure rates for stress incontinence as well as complication rates at 1 and 2 years between these two surgical approaches. Another primary goal is to compare bother scores from stress urinary incontinence between these two surgical approaches at 1 and 2 years. 

Other study aims include: 
-	Comparison of the morbidity between the two approaches which will include intraoperative injury, voiding dysfunction, changes of anatomic urethral support, sling erosion, and other complications.
-	Comparison of patient satisfaction and quality of life variables between the two different approaches. 
-	Comparison of the subjective cure rates of stress incontinence and overall incontinence between the two approaches.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION:  In 2000, the NIDDK established the Urinary Incontinence Treatment Network (UITN).  The purpose of the UITN is to conduct high quality randomized controlled clinical trials of urinary incontinence.  Currently, the UITN is completing a trial comparing two surgical procedures for women with stress urinary incontinence, “A Randomized Clinical Trial of the Burch Modified Tanagho and Autologous Fascia Sling Procedures.”  The second protocol, developed by the UITN investigators is:  “Retropubic Mid-urethral Sling (RMUS) vs. Transobturator Mid-Urethral Sling (TOMUS)”.  Although this protocol has been recently approved by an independent NIDDK-appointed Data and Safety Monitoring Board and patient recruitment is anticipated to begin in late winter to spring 2006, the collaborator(s) will, nonetheless, have the opportunity to comment on the study protocol. The Collaborator(s) will also participate as an ex-officio member of the Steering Committee.  It is anticipated that the duration of this trial will be at least 4 years, a 2 year recruitment followed by a minimum of 24 months follow-up. The collaborator(s) will need to provide products (slings) and devices for placement (disposable per patient use kits or non-disposable, sterilizable instruments) at the time of the surgical procedures. It is anticipated that the need of the products will be during the surgical phase of this study, during the initial 24 month recruitment phase and surgical placement of sling of this trial. The Collaborator (s) is (are) expected to provide the products (mid-urethral slings) and/or the placement device product line (either disposable per use kits or non-disposable, sterilizable instruments) for free without charge. The Collaborators may provide either or both sling products and/or placement device products or instruments. The Collaborator(s) may have access to information about the outcome of the study at the same time as the participating investigators.  If desired, the Collaborator(s) may participate as a member of the publication committee.  A Clinical Trials Agreement between the NIDDK and the Collaborator(s) will need to be executed prior to shipment of the products or placement kits or surgical instruments. 

CAPABILITY STATEMENTS:  A Selection Committee will utilize the information provided in the “Collaborator Capability Statements” to help in their deliberations.  It is the intention of the NIDDK that qualified applicants will have the opportunity to provide information to the Selection Committee through their Capability Statements.  The Capability Statement may not exceed 10 pages and should address the following criteria: time line for ability to ship sling product or retropubic or transobturator device kits or instruments after selection of Collaborator is determined and prior studies and approval of safety and use of their product. 

TERMS:	The Collaborator will be expected to execute a Clinical Trial Agreement, an example of which can be found at http://techdev.niddk.nih.gov/CTA-device-extramural.doc.  No funding from the government is available.

SUBMISSION DATES:  A written statement of interest must be submitted by 23 September 2005 and all Collaborator Capability Statements must be submitted by 30 September 2005.

AMENDMENT 1 QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS RFQ 05M000181

1) There are  references to audio-visual materials (Attachment B. under Deliverables- d). The question is this:  are you looking for a variety of training media (workbook, CD-Rom, video, etc.) or  just expecting the "training outline"?  Perhaps you could define "outline"?

Answer:  No a/v materials are requested.  What is expected are separate training guides.  The outlines will be the “table of contents” for the guides.
 
2)  Do you want a separate training guide (outline) for each distinct group:  consumers, families, providers?  

Answer: 3 to 5 guides are requested.  They may target the specific groups so noted.

3) Are costs for production of these guidebooks (no matter what format they are in) included in this proposal, or is SAMHSA just expecting the "outline" and SAMHSA will do the actual production?

Answer: SAMHSA is expecting the guides – not the outlines for such - and the implementation plan in print ready format.   SAMHSA will do actual production.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification to the Request for Information for Force Readiness Support Services is to respond to several questions that have been raised. The date for submission of responses is unchanged as a result of this modification.

Question 1: Is there an incumbent contractor currently providing these services?

Response: Yes, these services are currently being provided by Aaron B. Floyd Enterprises, Inc. under Contract HC1047-04-C-4056.

Question 2: A question has arisen regarding the preferred technology for this environment. Please provide detailed information about the current state (hosting platforms, networking infrastructure, development environment and tool set such as .net, rational, or other, and databases). Also, please provide a brief description of the organization's vision for moving forward and interests related to technology.

Response: The Global Command and Control System - Joint (GCCS-J) Force Readiness is the official Department of Defense registry for all military units worldwide. It is the Department of Defense's "system of record" for providing the mandatory readiness status of all military units worldwide with respect to the quality and quantity of personnel and equipment. Unit status is continually updated, but by law must be updated at least once every 30 days. The Force Readiness system consists of the following three applications: Readiness Assessment System Input Tool, Status of Resources and Training System Database, and Readiness System Output Tool. The system must meet all J6 security requirements. J6 is the accreditation authority. Currently, GCCS-J Force Readiness is moving to a new block upgrade. This block upgrade, call Block V, focuses on establishing web-based functionality housed on an Oracle 10g/Solaris 10 architecture.

Respondents are reminded that the date for submission of responses is unchanged as a result of this modification.

<DESC>The United State Government, seeking to achieve a comprehensive settlement of conflict and advance the prospect for peace in the Middle East, seeks to examine the options for a pragmatic, tangible and secure transportation between two geographically dispersed regions. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), in conjunction with the World Bank, will undertake a feasibility study of possible transportation links where the physical interconnection must meet stringent requirements to include security considerations.

<DESC>Sources Sought.  The U.S. Coast Guard Engineering Logistics Center (USCG ELC) is seeking qualified sources that can receipt, disassemble, inspect and overhaul Conserve Control Units, NSN 5310-99-776-6898, manufactured by Regulators Europa, Ltd, P/N’s LISTGS17-100A & 84-0A-178-P03, which are used onboard the main propulsion engine control systems on the U. S.  Coast Guard (USCG)  110’ WPB Class Cutters.  A firm, fixed price requirements type contract consisting of a base year plus four option years is anticipated.  Estimated quantities for each year will be shown in the solicitation.  FOB Destination to the USCG ELC, Receiving Room, Bldg 88, 2401 Hawkins Point Road, Baltimore, MD 21226-5000.
A USCG Quality Assurance inspection at origin shall be required and shall be conducted by a USCG Quality Assurance Representative. 
The North American Industry Code (NAICS) for this acquisition is 811310 with a size standard of $6.0.
The standard repair specification provides the requirements for the receipt, disassembly, inspection and condition/test reports, overhaul/repair, reassembly, testing preservation and packing of the USCG Conserve Control Units.
All efforts shall be made in accordance with Regulators Europa specifications, standards and recommended procedures  as stated in the USCG Specification.
This will be a full and open competition requirement utilizing only Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) replacement parts in the overhaul of these Conserve Control Units.  It is the Government’s belief that only the OEM and/or its authorized repair facilities can (1) obtain the necessary specifications and genuine OEM parts to accomplish repairs; and (2) can furnish the required items and ensure the proper fit, form and function of all its components.  Therefore, it is the USCG’s intent to handle this procurement as a sole source with Regulators Europa or its authorized facilities/distributors. Technical data and/or drawings pertaining to Regulators Europa are not available within the Government and are proprietary to Regulators Europa.  Accordingly, it is believed that this non-availability of technical data precludes the USCG ELC from obtaining competition (for parts only) as they are available form only one source.  Organizations having the expertise and required capabilities to provide brand name parts are invited to submit complete information discussing such capabilities.  However, other potential sources can submit information concerning its capability to overhaul the Conserve Control Units for the purpose of the USCG to determine whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Organizations having the expertise and required capabilities to provide the parts, technical representative , and perform the overhauls are invited to submit complete information discussing such capabilities by providing:
(1)	Data that the offered parts have been satisfactorily manufactured for the Government or the Original Equipment Manufacturer, which includes Complete and Current engineering data to demonstrate the acceptability of the offered parts (i.e.  salient physical, functional and serviceability characteristics) or
(2)	Data that the required overhaul has been previously and successful provided to the government or the Original Equipment Manufacturer.
This data must include sufficient information to allow the Coast Guard to evaluate. The Coast Guard does not intend to pay for information solicited.  Responses shall be submitted within 15 days of this announcement.  Responses must be concise and specific to the requirements mentioned above.  No cost or pricing information is required at this time.  See numbered notes 22 and 26.

<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-RFI8-10-2005
<RESPDATE>091905
<CONTACT>Michael Mee, Contract Specialist, Phone 303-672-5281 x1820, Fax 303-672-5062, Email Michael_J._Mee@hud.gov - Gay Julian, Supvy Contract Spec. (Branch Chief), Phone 303-672-5281 x1819, Fax 303-672-5062, Email Gay_E._Julian@hud.gov
<DESC>The Department of the Housing and Urban Development, Office of the Chief Financial Officer, Washington, DC has a requirement for technical services to support the HUD Integrated Financial Management Improvement Project (HIFMIP).  The majority of the direct support will be provided in Washington, DC; however, the servicing facility does not need to be in Washington, DC.   The HIFMIP initiative has requirements to integrate their current core financial functions into the PeopleSoft COTS core financial software and to bring the system up using a Financial Management Center of Excellence (COE).  The term Center of Excellence (COE) for purposes of this document means a Shared Services Provider. HUD is seeking information for a cross-servicing contractor or contracting team made up of a Financial Management COE and an integrator to move HUD’s core financial functions from its current software into the core financial PeopleSoft COTS software for the functions and technical capabilities described herein. HUDs preference is for highly qualified small business sources or a team led by a small business source; however, large business sources willing to subcontract up to 40% to small business sources will also be considered

By this Request for Information (RFI) HUD is beginning its survey of the commercial marketplace to assess the technical and functional capabilities for the cross-servicing of its integrated core financial management system and for the availability of integrator resources to assist HUD with the integration of its core financial functions into PeopleSoft’s Financial Management Solutions (FMS).    The information will be used exclusively by HUD support staff to assist in systems acquisition planning.  

OBJECTIVES - HUD's goals in implementing this solution include: (1) Integration and standardization of data and systems across all HUD offices. (2) Providing management with access to timely and accurate financial, budget, asset and related information on programs and projects. (3) Implementation of advanced technology to provide the greatest capability and an extended life cycle.  The objectives of this survey include obtaining an understanding of and making assessments about appropriate Financial Management COE (cross-servicing) services teamed with integrator capabilities with respect to implementing HUD's core financial management system and to ensure the vendors understand the OMB Financial Management COE requirements and due diligence factors for selection.  The survey also will be used to assess currently available technology and planned technology capabilities in the near term (2-3 years).  HUD wants to survey the entire commercial marketplace to ensure its’ programmatic and technology goals will be met by the best available Financial Management COE and Integrator teaming possible.  HUD is seeking comprehensive information for planning purposes including details for the following proposed service level parameters: 

·	Availability requirements including:  access, documentation, backup, and recovery times to critical issues to redress and resolve any discovered problems and financial remedies for breaches. 
·	Timeliness of information. All interfaces must provide real-time access to data, Data accuracy, Integrity of financial data, Timeliness of data correction actions,
·	Operational support and corrective maintenance, Security, and Performance. 

HUD intends to establish minimum performance standards for the entire contract and the list above is not exhaustive.  Prospective vendors are encouraged to suggest more performance requirements for HUD’s consideration.  The suggestions should include how performance should best be measured and what the minimum requirements should be. 

In addition to the information requested above, please complete the document, “HIFMIP Specific Questions”.

SCOPE - These systems will be used to support all HUD’s field installations and headquarters (approximately 81 region and field sites) and for the management of HUD’s budgetary appropriation of approximately $ 30 billion per year. ENVIRONMENT - All HUD facilities are interconnected via a high-speed computer network that is a part of the Internet. HUD maintains its own backbone network based on the TCP/IP protocol that has direct links to local area networks at each field location.  It should be assumed that any HUD employee using these core financial system applications would be equipped with a personal computer (IBM compatible) and a local area network connection providing connectivity to any other HUD location.

Individual responses should indicate whether they are a large, small, small disadvantaged, disabled veteran, or women-owned business.  If they are a large business, identify if 40% or more of the total value of the contract would be contracted to a small or disabled veteran business.  In addition, please provide your GSA Schedule Number contact and phone number.  HUD shall not assume any expenses incurred by any of the respondents to this RFI.  This is not a Request for Proposals (RFP) and as such, no solicitationis currently available.  It is the Government's intention to conduct this procurement in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 8.4, Federal Supply Schedules, utilizing the General Services Administration's (GSA) Schedule 70 - General Purpose Commercial Information Technology Equipment, Software, and Services.

All responses must be submitted no later than Monday, September 19, 2005, in the form of a “white paper”, limited to no more than 25-pages in length. Respondents should identify their company’s name, address, telephone number, and point of contact.  Proprietary information must be clearly marked.  Additional informational brochures are acceptable, if available. The attached checklists, and informational brochures are not subject to the 25-page limitation.  Any material submitted will not be returned.  It is recommended that the white paper be submitted in hard paper form in addition to electronic media via compact disk (CD) for IBM compatible PCs using Microsoft Office 2000 compatible/readable products.  HUD reserves the right to contact vendors, to provide clarification on capabilities or to ask questions.  All materials should be delivered to the following address:

<DESC>The Oregon Army National Guard is intending to sole source the following procurement to Vertical Reality of Miami, FL. A portable mobile clear climbing wall with breakaway trailer.  This particular type of wall is a flat clear wall.  This type of wal l is a 4 person climber and all 4 stations can be operated at the same time allowing for more traffic to flow through the display and therefore allow more potential applicants to use the wall  and interact with recruiters.  The clear design of the wall add s a great competition aspect to the climbing as two climbers can look directly at each other as they race to the top.  The wall has a tow trailer that detaches from the wall during set-up thereby providing a smaller footprint than traditional walls.  This allows more flexibility to set up the wall in places where a large footprint is not reasonable.  The rock wall is also equipped with auto-belay, meaning the belay system is fully automatic, allowing two people to safely and effectively run the wall.  In ad dition, National Guard artwork is to be placed between the layers of the wall.  This will allow for the protection of the artwork and allow for easy visibility of the advertising in two directions from a greater distance.  Logos will be placed at approxima te height of 20 feet.  The wall is approximately 24 in height and is constructed of Lexan a polymer material and encased in steel construction.  Individual weight load for each station ranges from 35 pounds to 275 pounds. Current market research has shown that no other company produces this type of wall.  Contractors that can meet the requirements must be registered on the Central Contractors Registration (CCR) database and be Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) capable.  All inquiries are to be addressed to Mr . Pete Newell, 503-584-3763 not later than close of business on August 17, 2005.

<SUBJECT>R -- Global Public Health Surveillance
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to award on a sole source basis a Purchase Order to Public Health Agency of Canada for access to their Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN).  It is a continuing requirement providing part of the overall intelligence mission to monitor public health events globally in real time and multiple languages twenty-four hours, seven days a week.  Without this service CDC would be unable to monitor in  six different languages in the media and prevent threatening health issues worldwide.  GPHIN is a multilingual early warning global public health surveillance system that is able to gather, translate and disseminate public health information in all eight languages including the World Health Organization’s (WHO) official languages, Arabic, Chinese (Simplified and Traditional), English, Farsi, French, Spanish and Russian.   By virtue, Public Health Agency of Canada is uniquely qualified and capable of carrying out the requirements of this proposed purchase order.  The anticipated award date is August 26, 2005.  This is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available.  Firms that believe they can provide this requirement are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification, as well as, a capability statement to the contracting office by August 25, 2005.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed actions based on responses to this notice is solely within its discretion.  Information will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquiries may be sent to the attention of Pamela Bolling by e-mail at pbolling@cdc.gov or by fax 770-488-2688.

<SUBJECT>A -- Scientific and Commercial Development and Testing of Angio-inhibitory Peptides Derived from Human TIMP-2
<DESC>Recent findings made at the National Cancer Institute demonstrate that TIMP-2 (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2) exerts a matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-independent anti-angiogenic effect in vivo that is mediated by TIMP-2 binding to the alpha3 beta1 integrin receptor, facilitating protein tyrosine phosphatase activity.  This anti-angiogenic effect is in addition to TIMP-2 regulation of the remodeling of the extracellular matrix through MMPs.

The National Cancer Institute (NCI) is currently seeking cooperative partners to work with investigators in the Center for Cancer Research (CCR) to exploit, for drug development and clinical testing, novel TIMP-2 peptide-based inhibitors of angiogenesis.  Research and development will include preclinical in vitro and in vivo testing of synthetic TIMP-2 peptides, structure-activity relationship analysis, development, production and testing of small molecule analogs of these peptides using GMP methods, followed by clinical trials.

Potential Areas of Application:
1)  Therapeutic use of novel inhibitors of angiogenesis based on MMP-independent TIMP-2 anti-angiogenesis function.

State of Development:
1)  CCR has identified a number of synthetic peptides that mimic linear sequences of TIMP-2 that bind the alpha3 beta1 integrin receptor, retaining anti-angiogenic activity in vitro and in vivo.

Further R&D Required:
1)  Development of additional TIMP-2 mimetic peptides with enhanced angiogenic activities.
2)  Synthesis of small molecule analogs of TIMP-2 mimetic peptides with angiogenic activity.
3)  Preclinical and clinical trials of synthetic TIMP-2 mimetic peptides and small molecule analogs.

Patent Status :
1)  A patent application is being filed for TIMP-2 angio-inhibitory peptides.
2)  U.S. Patent No. 5,698,671 issued December 16, 1997, “Metalloproteinase Peptides.”
3)  U.S. Patent No. 5,595,885 issued January 21, 1997, “Matrix Metalloproteinase Inhibitor Peptides.”

<SUBJECT>58 -- Joint Precision Approach and Landing System (JPALS) Exchanges with Industry
<DESC>This Special Notice is to inform Industry that the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), Patuxent River, MD desires to continue its exchanges with industry in its planning of the JPALS Acquisition Strategy for System Development and Demonstration (SDD).  JPALS is a Global Positioning System (GPS)/Inertial Navigation System (INS)-based precision approach and landing system (on land and at sea) that enables military aircraft to safely execute approaches to landing when ceiling and visibility are limiting factors.  JPALS is a Joint Program with the Navy, Air Force and Army as its participants.  Enabling technologies include Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) with an anti-jam capability, a Low Probability of Intercept (LPI) UHF Data Link, and Inertial Navigation System (Sea Based only).  The JPALS program requirements also include civil interoperability for all airborne platforms and land based installations. 

A competitive, performance-based specification RFP for the JPALS SDD effort is currently planned for release in the second quarter of FY06, resulting in a Best Value source selection award early in the fourth quarter of FY06.  In this best value source selection, the Government is considering awarding one or more contracts to qualified offerors.  The Government would allocate a set amount of funding per offeror and carry the offerors to a down select event.  At the downselect, the Government would exercise an option contract line item to continue with the contractor determined to provide the best value to the Government. 

The JPALS Program requests Industry provide feedback on this proposed strategy.  Specifically, the Government wishes to know:

a.	What are the perceived risks with the proposed down select strategy?

b.	Assuming $20M is available to each of the initially selected offerors, what tasks could be completed for the proposed funding? What are the “planning number” costs/man-hours associated with each task.  What is the timeline for completing these tasks?

c.	If $20M was taken out of the equation, what tasks could be completed within the timeframe if the Government determined that the down select event would occur about 1 month after the SFR (currently planned for 4QFY07).  What are estimated “planning number” costs/man-hours associated with each task?  What are the associated costs if the Government were to go to PDR, 2QFY08?

Responses should be presented as a top-level schedule depicting major tasks and events.  For each task and event please provide a description of the task/event and associated costs.  

Interested parties should periodically check the PMA-213 web site, https://pma213.navair.navy.mil/jpals_industry, for updated information on JPALS.  Industry members are encouraged to respond to these questions and provide additional/alternative inputs.

Other comments and suggestions regarding the Government's course of action and/or alternatives are encouraged and appreciated.  It is requested all written responses and comments be received no later than 4:00 PM on Monday, 12 Aug 2005.  Firms responding should indicate whether they are a small business (S), a small disadvantaged business (SDB), an 8(a) firm, or a large business (L).  Further, please indicate the firm’s desire as to whether it it is at the prime or subcontractor level for the upcoming SDD.

Points of Contact:  Responses and inquiries should be e-mailed to the following individuals:

Lynda Frattone - Lynda.Frattone@navy.mil, Contracting Officer/AIR-2.2.1.3, telephone (301) 757-5936; and Jeff Semenza – Jeff.Semenza@navy.mil, Program, Plans and Controls/PMA21352 telephone (301) 995-6267.
An alternate contact for inquiries is Herb Hause, Herb.Hause@navy.mil, JPALS Operations/ PMA21352A, telephone (301) 995-6266.

Note:  This Special Notice is provided for planning purposes only and is subject to change. This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) and the Government is not committed or obligated to pay for any information submitted in response to this notice, and no basis for claim shall arise as a result of this notice or contractor response to this notice.

<DESC>USDA-ARS Grazinglands Research Laboratory announces its intent to issue a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial item under a contract utilizing simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with FAR subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued, for the lease of one (1) each Carbon Hydrogen Nitrogen Sulfur Analyzer.  A firm fixed-price contract consisting of a base year and two (2) one-year option periods is anticipated.  Solicitation #R51-7MN1-2005 is being issued as a Request for Quotes (RFQ).  The equipment will be delivered, installed and maintained at the Grazinglands Research Laboratory, 7207 West Cheyenne Street, El Reno, Oklahoma  73036. Each offeror shall include its proposed delivery schedule as part of its quotation.  Acceptance and FOB point are destination.  In order to be considered for award, offerors shall provide a quotation on company letterhead detailing the unit pricing; descriptive literature and brochures; references for the proposed equipment.  The significant evaluation factors, in the relative order of importance, are technical capability, past performance; and price (based on F.O.B. Destination), technical and past performance are more important than price.  Award will be made based on overall best value to the Government.  The Offeror shall extend to the Government the full coverage of any standard commercial warranty normally offered in a similar commercial sale.  The instrument will be used for elemental measurements of agricultural samples from experiments supporting the laboratory mission to provide new technology and management strategies that increase the profitability and promote the sustainability and conservation of grazing land resources. To assure no ambiguity due to sample heterogeneity and merging of data, results for macro quantities of all elements should be measured simultaneously on the combustion gas of a single sample rather than sub samples.  A single analyzer must meet or exceed these minimum requirements: (1) automated simultaneous measurement of macro quantities of carbon (C), hydrogen (H), nitrogen (N), and sulfur (S) elements produced by combustion of a single sample; (2) measuring ranges (and maximum): C, 0.002 to 100% (100 mg); N, 0.004 to 100% (100 mg); H, 0.015 to 100% (15 mg); S, 0.004 to 100% (15 mg); (3) precise elemental analysis for samples weights ranging from a few mg to as much as 1500 mg or a sample volume of 1 mL.  In addition, to reduce costs associated with oxygen consumption per analysis, oxygen required for combustion should be self regulated and controlled by the instrument to not exceed a combined total of 0.4 L for analysis of the four elements C, H, N and S.  The following provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition and can be found in full text at http://www.arnet.gov/far/loadmainre.html.  FAR 52.252-1, Solicitation Provisions Incorporated by Reference are as follows: FAR 52.212 1, Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation- Commercial Items; FAR 52.212 3, Offeror Representations and Certifications Commercial Items (Provide with Quote); FAR 52.214-21, Descriptive Literature (Provide with Quote); FAR 52.204-7, Central Contractor Registration (All Offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Database in order to receive an award.

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled "Technology Assessment" which was posted on August 1, 2005.  You are notified that the following responses to questions submitted are shown below:  1.   Will MSFC release the company name and point of contact for each potential offerer expressing interest in this solicitation and on the MSFC bidder list so that we can extend an offer of assistance?	 No, this is a competitive procurement. 2.   Since this is a RFQ and price is a determining factor, what criteria does NASA use to compare the price / quality relationship?  Is there a limit on supporting data submitted with the fixed price offer?  Merits for selecting the contractor depend on the experience in managing space flight demonstration projects. Evaluating the potential impact of technologies on systems requires experience in managing projects that raised the technology readiness level through hardware demonstrations. The amount of supporting data should include experience of the team pertaining to project management, technology development, and evaluation of technologies in the definition of future concepts. 3.   Is there an existing incumbent contractor doing this or related work for the same MSFC office and who is that contractor?  No 4.   Will NASA consider an offer that uses an existing IDIQ contract as the vehicle for award under this solicitation?	If yes, will SOW task descriptions, price quotation, and contract identification be an acceptable response to this solicitation? (An IDIQ - indefinite delivery indefinite quantity - contract can be a sole source award when funds are transferred to the contract monitor to perform an agreed scope of work.) If no, why not?  The soliciting office and contracting officer are not aware of an existing IDIQ contract for performing technology assessments and forecasting for space architectures. 5. What is the period of performance for this effort? Approximately 50 weeks. 6. What are the evaluation factors for this effort? Refer to the answer of question 2. 7. Are hard copy and electronic deliverables required? Data delivery should occur, electronically, through entry in the TTB database or in Microsoft Office file formats. Periodic reports to the contract office and contract officers’ technical representative should occur in letter form with narrative descriptions of accomplishments for the reporting period. These reports may accompany a monthly invoice.  8. Is there other information contained in the on-line RFQ? The online RFQ includes the statement of work. 9. I'm having difficulty trying to bound the costs without an better understanding of what technologies the SP20 project teams are going to recommend research and assessment of.  It looks like a year long (50 week) contract, but without more ideas on what technologies and how many are expected, I cannot bound how many engineers I need to support the effort. Technologies to be evaluated include common subsystems for space transportation, surface systems, and exploration equipment. A few examples include environmental control and life support systems, energy storage, power management, thermal management, telemetry. Data should include the performance characteristics that can be used in parametric equations used to estimate, as a minimum, the mass, power, and volume. Other desired data includes operations characteristics that can be used to estimate workforce and supporting equipment requirements. 10. Number of personnel anticipated to be required to perform the effort?  The anticipated number of people depends on the experience and skills of the individuals. 11. Number of historical technology research elements anticipated to be addressed in Task 1? The ATLAS project is in a research and development phase, so the project team will address as many elements as possible within the available time and budget. 12. The synopsis states that the contractor will establish an account to the Technology Tool Box (TTB).  Will connectivity be provided by NASA?  Is connectivity available at any location or is it limited to specific locations?  Details for obtaining access to the TTB will be provided to the winning contractor. Connectivity is not limited to specific locations. 13. Task 2 states that technology assessments will include forecasts based on task 1 findings.  What is meant by “Technology forecasts shall include state-of-the-art numbers…”?  Data shall include specific performance numbers, for example, specific energy density and length, heighth, and width. If available, the data shall include operations metrics, for example, mean time between failures. State of the art refers to the values of the technology today. Forecasts should begin with the proven performance and operations characteristics. 14. Is there a requirement that all work under this effort be physically performed at or near MSFC?  If not, what are the requirements for physical presence (frequency and quantity)?  It is not required that the work be performed at MSFC. It would be beneficial for periodic face-to-face meetings with the ATLAS development team. 15. The scope of work specifies that “…efforts involve reviewing and commenting on project related documentation”.   Please provide an estimate of the magnitude of this task (e.g., expected frequency, size of documents). Documents associated with the advanced projects activities include requirements, reports, guides, and presentations. The minimum number of documents to be reviewed will be five. The proposal may offer a maximum number. 16. Our approach is best suited to literature searches involving very large collections of documents, so we wanted to check with you to understand for the project envisioned in today's announcement, what is the scope of the document collection?  Is it in the hundreds, or thousands, or tens of thousands and beyond?  The anticipated number of documents to be thoroughly researched is less than 100. The due date for responses is not extended. Documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/MSFC Business Opportunities home page is  http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=62   Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation and any amendments.   Potential offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any).

“DEFINITIONAL MISSION” FOR ADVISORY AND ASSISTANCE SERVICES BY NON-GOVERNMENTAL SOURCES FOR NIGERIA.

PROJECT TITLE:  NIGERIA: POWER SECTOR

1		SCOPE OF WORK

The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (“USTDA”) requires services under this non-personal services Contract to support or improve its decision-making relative to the funding of projects and activities in developing and middle income countries. The Contractor shall provide a report to USTDA, which will: 

1.2		assess and justify whether or not USTDA should provide funding for the proposed study, technical assistance or other trade capacity building activities herein after referred to as “study(ies)”; 

1.3		assess any alternative study or activities which the Contractor sees as viable options for USTDA consideration; and 

1.4	provide supporting analysis and recommendations on the above information in a final report that analyzes all the relevant issues. 

2  		DELIVERY & PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS

2.1		KICK-OFF MEETING WITH THE USTDA PROGRAM OFFICE

Upon award, the Contractor shall contact USTDA’s Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative, Regional Director Ned Cabot, to schedule a meeting to discuss details of the Contract assignment.  Unless otherwise advised by the COTR, this meeting will be held at USTDA’s office in Arlington, Virginia. The COTR shall provide the Contractor with names and addresses of the project sponsor(s), other pertinent entities to contact in the United States and overseas, and any other relevant details that may impact upon the design and/or evaluation of the proposed project(s).  
 
2.2		PRE-VISIT REPORT (3-5 PAGES)

Prior to departure to the host country, the Contractor shall provide the COTR a pre-visit written report containing the proposed schedule or itinerary, preliminary strategies or findings on viability of the project(s), financing options, U.S. company interest in the project (s), a list of contacts to be made during the visit and a pre-visit checklist of issues, information and questions to be utilized during the visit.  

 
2.3		USTDA RESPONSIBILITY

USTDA will advise the U.S. Embassy in the host country of the Contractor’s proposed travel itinerary prior to departure and request that the Commercial Section of the Embassy provide the Contractor with names and addresses of appropriate host country officials with whom to meet.

2.4		CONTRACTOR’S HOST COUNTRY TRAVEL 

The Contractor shall travel to the host country to meet with relevant project officials and with the U.S. Embassy.    The Contractor shall contact the Commercial Section at the U.S. Embassy upon arrival and prior to departure for briefing and debriefing meetings.   While the Embassy may be able to assist the Contractor in arranging some initial meetings with host country officials, the Contractor is responsible for arranging the meetings as well as logistics for the visit, i.e., hotel accommodations, transportation, and interpretation services. In some cases, the Contractor may need to Contract with a local entity to assist with these logistics.  Local entities may not provide the technical work of substance for the creation of the DM report. 

2.5		CONTRACTOR MEANINGFUL DISCUSSIONS

The Contractor shall hold meaningful discussions with appropriate contacts to determine and gauge the interest of potential project financiers and potential U.S. suppliers and assess whether the proposed project(s) is economically, financially, and technically viable.  The Contractor shall analyze the potential procurement of U.S. goods and services for project implementation by categories and dollar values.  The analysis shall include an assessment of the project risks and its financial viability, the priority of the project and political/social/organizational support it has, potential sources of financing, and the capability and experience of the project sponsor.  The analysis shall also include an assessment of the social and economic development impacts of the proposed project.

2.6		USTDA REPORT OBJECTIVES

If the Contractor recommends that USTDA fund the study (ies) in a phased approach, and/or if any outstanding issues should be resolved or conditions met before funding is approved, those phases, issues and/or conditions should be clearly explained in the recommendation.

2.6.1		The Contractor shall provide a final report to the USTDA, which will: 

2.6.1.1		assess and justify whether or not USTDA should provide funding for a study of the proposed project(s); 

2.6.1.2		 assess any alternative or other activities which the Contractor sees as viable options for USTDA consideration; and 

2.6.1.3	          provide recommendations on the above information in a final report that analyzes all relevant issues

2.6.2		Contractor recommendations shall be based upon USTDA funding criteria, which are that the project must: 

2.6.2.1 	be likely to receive implementation financing, and in addition, have a procurement process that provides “equal access” to U.S. firms;

2.6.2.2		represent an opportunity for sales of U.S. goods and services that is many times greater than the initial investment of USTDA assistance;

2.6.2.3		be a development priority of the project sponsor and country where the project is located and have the endorsement of the U.S. Embassy in that nation; and

2.6.2.4		involve U.S. companies that are facing market entry problems and/or strong competition from foreign companies, which often receive subsidies, and other support from their governments.

<DESC>6 		PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND PROFILE

Nigeria (pop. 130 million) has approximately 6,000 megawatts of installed electric generating capacity, consisting of three hydroelectric plants and five thermal power stations.  Due mostly to poor infrastructure, only about 3,000 megawatts make its way to end-users.  It is estimated that 60 percent of Nigeria’s total population and 90 percent of its rural population does not have access to electricity.  Recognizing this major shortfall and its developmental impacts, Nigerian President Obasanjo has pledged to expand the nation’s power generation capacity to 10,000 megawatts by 2010.  To keep up with the anticipated growth in power generation, the nation’s transmission line infrastructure is in need of a major upgrade.  The Ministry of Power and Steel estimates that about $1.5 billion is required to develop the transmission grid to handle 6,500 MW.  Another $2.5 billion will be needed over seven years to support the expected increases in supply.

Nigeria made a significant step forward in privatizing the power sector when, earlier this year, it signed into law the Power Sector Reform Bill.  The bill breaks NEPA’s monopoly and puts the sector on a more commercial footing.  NEPA has been subsequently transformed into the Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN).  PHCN will operate for one more year and within this period transfer control to at least 18 successor companies (six generation companies, 11 independent distribution companies, and one transmission company).  Under the plan, each of the successor companies—except for the transmission company, which will remain public—will be registered as a limited liability company and privatized.

NEPA was founded in 1972, and operated as a fully government-owned, vertically integrated monopoly until the recent signing of the power bill.  NEPA was involved in all aspects of power supply, from generation to transmission and distribution.  Poor management under NEPA has led to a significant backlog of potential project opportunities in the power sector.  Lack of maintenance, coupled with increasing demand for power, has led to power blackouts, brownouts, and load shedding.

USTDA recently awarded a grant to Owel Holdings Limited in Nigeria for the feasibility study of a $110 million IPP on the Niger Delta that would make use of natural gas flaring from surrounding oil fields.  Other potential IPP projects in Nigeria would provide additional generation capacity, while also serving to liberalize the power sector.

The DM consultant will be expected to conduct initial research on power sector project developments and opportunities in Nigeria before traveling to identify those opportunities most suited for USTDA involvement.  The DM consultant will meet with appropriate public and private sector representatives, and conduct site visits where appropriate.  

The DM will assess the soundness and future financeability of each project recommended for USTDA’s further consideration.  Developmental impacts and measurement factors will be addressed for each project.  The potential for U.S. exports and impacts upon U.S. labor and the local environment will also be issues under review for each project.
 
Annex I

IMPACT ON U.S. LABOR STATEMENT

The Foreign Operations, Export Financing and Related Programs Appropriations legislation restricts U.S. foreign assistance from being used to provide: (a) any financial incentive to a business enterprise currently located in the United States for the purpose of inducing such an enterprise to relocate outside the United States if such incentive or inducement is likely to reduce the number of employees of such business enterprise in the United States because United States production is being replaced by such enterprise outside the United States; (b) assistance for any project or activity that contributes to the violation of internationally recognized workers rights; and (c) direct assistance for establishing or expanding production of any commodity for export by any country other than the United States, if the commodity is likely to be in surplus on world markets at the time the resulting productive capacity is expected to become operative and if the assistance will cause substantial injury to United States producers of the same, similar, or competing commodity. 

 
Annex II

USTDA Nationality Requirements

The purpose of USTDA's nationality, source, and origin requirements is to assure the maximum practicable participation of American contractors, technology, equipment and materials in the pre-feasibility, feasibility, and implementation stages of a project.


USTDA STANDARD RULE (GRANT AGREEMENT STANDARD LANGUAGE):

Except as USTDA may otherwise agree, the following provisions shall govern the delivery of goods and services funded by USTDA under this Grant Agreement: (a) for professional services, the Contractor must be either a U.S. firm or U.S. consultant; (b) the Contractor may use U.S. subcontractors without limitation, but the use of subcontractors from host country may not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the USTDA Grant amount and may only be used for specific services from the Terms of Reference identified in the subcontract; (c) employees of U.S. Contractor or U.S. subcontractor firms responsible for professional services shall be U.S. citizens or non-U.S. citizens lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S.; (d) goods purchased for implementation of the Study and associated delivery services (e.g., international transportation and insurance) must have their nationality, source and origin in the United States; and (e) goods and services incidental to Study support (e.g., lodging, food, and transportation) in host country are not subject to the above restrictions. USTDA will make available further details concerning these standards of eligibility upon request.

NATIONALITY:
1.	Rule

Except as USTDA may otherwise agree, the Contractor for USTDA funded activities must be either a U.S. firm or a U.S. consultant. Prime contractors may utilize U.S. subcontractors, but the use of host country subcontractors is limited to 20% of the USTDA grant amount.
2.	Application

Accordingly, only a U.S. firm or U.S. consultant may submit proposals on USTDA-funded activities. Although those proposals may include subcontracting arrangements with host country firms or individuals for up to 20% of the USTDA grant amount, they may not include subcontracts with third country entities. U.S. firms submitting proposals must ensure that the professional services funded by the USTDA grant, to the extent not subcontracted to host country entities, are supplied by employees of the firm or employees of U.S. subcontractor firms who are U.S. individuals. 

Interested U.S. firms and consultants who submit proposals must meet USTDA nationality requirements as of the due date for the submission of proposals and, if selected, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. These nationality provisions apply to whatever portion of the Terms of Reference is funded with the USTDA grant. 
3.	Definitions

A "U.S. individual" is (a) a U.S. citizen, or (b) a non-U.S. citizen lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S. (a green card holder).

A "U.S. consultant" is (a) a U.S. citizen whose principal place of business is in the United States, or (b) a non-U.S. citizen lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S. (a green card holder) whose principal place of business is in the U.S.

Guidance on USTDA Development Impact Measures

USTDA has a dual mission of promoting US exports and advancing economic development in the host country.  USTDA would like to re-emphasize the Agency’s developmental mandate.  Toward this goal, the Agency is collecting more detailed information regarding the impact of its activities on the economic development of the host country.

What does USTDA mean by Development Impact?
USTDA’s activities impact host country economic development in a variety of ways.  There are four primary categories that are tracked and measured.  However, the Agency recognizes that there are additional ways that activities can benefit the host country.  Therefore, study contractors are encouraged to address any significant benefits. 

Category	Explanation
Infrastructure	USTDA funds feasibility studies of and technical assistance for many critically important infrastructure projects such as power plants, roads, ports, airports, telecommunications systems, water and sewerage systems or environmental improvements or enhancements, as well as projects such as refineries and manufacturing plants.  Implementation of these projects contributes to the improvement and security of the physical, financial and social infrastructure of the developing world.  
Market-Oriented Reform	Many USTDA activities have as a primary objective the facilitation of market-oriented reforms in developing countries. These reforms include encouraging more transparent regulatory systems and institutions, privatization of state-owned economic entities, promotion of greater competition in non-competitive economic sectors, lowering of non-tariff barriers to trade, strengthening of intellectual property rights and modernizing international trade systems and regulations.  
Human Capacity Building	When implemented, the Agency’s projects often create new job opportunities, sustain employment for those in jeopardy of losing jobs and/or offer advanced training to upgrade the capability of the work force.  USTDA considers a project to have Human Capacity Building impact if ten or more jobs are created and/or ten or more people receive significant training.
Technology Transfer and Productivity Improvement	The Agency’s projects result in the introduction of advanced technologies (e.g. management information systems or process technologies) or licenses that improve processes and/or systems , resulting in greater economic productivity or more efficient use of resources.
Other	Other development benefits not captured by the above four categories - examples include enhanced government revenue, increased good governance or spin-off projects.






 
How Should the TOR of the FS/TA Address Development Impact?

The TOR should include a task that assesses the expected development benefits of the proposed project.  For example:

The FS/TA Contractor shall report on the potential Development Impact of the project in the host country.  In this section, the FS/TA Contractor should focus on what the economic development outcomes will be if the project is implemented according to the study recommendations.    While specific focus should be paid to the immediate impact of the specific project that is being considered, the FS/TA contractor should include, where appropriate, any additional developmental benefits to the project, including spin-off and demonstration effects.  The analysis of potential benefits of the feasibility study contractor should be as concrete and detailed as possible.  The Development Impact factors are intended to provide the project’s decision-makers and interested parties with a broader view of the project’s potential effects on the host country.  The FS/TA contractor will provide estimates of the project’s potential benefits in the following areas: 

·	Infrastructure: a statement on the infrastructure impact giving a brief synopsis.  For example “This project would result in the construction of a power plant that would provide 500MW of power.  This plant would serve x additional households in the region.”

·	Market-Oriented Reform: a description of any regulation, laws, or institutional changes that are recommended and the effect they would have if implemented.

·	Human Capacity Building:  The Contractor should address the number and type of positions that would be needed to construct and operate the proposed project as well as the number of people who will receive training and a brief description of the training program.

·	Technology Transfer and Productivity Enhancement: a description of any advanced technologies that will be implemented as a result of the project.  A description of any efficiency that will be gained (e.g. “By upgrading the power plant’s old boilers, efficiency will be increased from x% to y%).

·	Other: any other developmental benefits to the project, including any spin-off or demonstration effects.

 
How Will This Affect the Final Report For the FS or TA?  

·	A section in the final report will be devoted to the projected host country Development Impact of the FS or TA recommendations if they are implemented.  The section should focus primarily on the key issues mentioned above (infrastructure and industrialization, human capacity building, technology transfer and productivity, and market oriented reform).  Other host country development impacts (e.g. improved financial revenue flows to host government etc.) can be mentioned where appropriate.  The discussion should be as detailed and concrete as possible, and the contractor may provide estimates in ranges as appropriate.

<DESC>6 		PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE

The Nigerian Stock Exchange was established in 1960 as the Lagos Stock Exchange and currently has 262 listed companies with a total market capitalization of $15.4 billion.  This is up from $3 billion and 180 listed companies in 1997.  There are approximately three million individual investors and hundreds of institutional investors.  The NSE has six branches, each with a trading floor.  The NSE has requested that USTDA consider providing assistance for the development of an emergency response plan that would include procurement of back-up software, hardware, and plans for the establishment of a secure, secondary location in the event of an emergency at NSE headquarters.  The definitional mission will investigate possible projects related to the NSE emergency response plan, as well as NSE’s overall IT infrastructure needs.

The Ghana Stock Exchange, established in 1989, has 31 listed companies.  In 2004, the GSE was the third highest performing stockmarket in the world with an 86% return during the year.  The GSE is looking to meet this growing demand for its securities by modernizing its IT infrastructure, which is likely to include the implementation of an automated trading system.  The definitional mission will investigate GSE’s IT needs and identify potential projects.

NSE and GSE are both members of the African Stock Exchanges Association (ASEA) Since its founding in 1993, the ASEA has not only promoted the further development of stock exchanges, but also greater cooperation among them.  In 2003, the NSE and GSE signed an MOU pledging closer cooperation, harmonization of rules of operation, and eventual integration of their exchanges.  The definitional mission will include a component examining projects and potential technical assistance needs related to the integration of the two stock markets within the ASEA.

Further integration of West Africa’s stock exchanges is part of a larger push toward regional integration, which has long been the goal of the 16-member Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).   While there is uncertainty over how long it will take to link West Africa's exchanges, it is clear that pooling the resources of the NSE and GSE would improve their ability to mobilize local and international capital for private-sector and infrastructure development.

The DM consultant will be expected to conduct initial research on the needs of the NSE and GSE before travel to identify those opportunities most suited for USTDA involvement.  The DM consultant will be required to travel to both countries to further investigate opportunities, meet with appropriate public and private sector representatives, and conduct site visits where appropriate.  The DM will assess the soundness and future financeability of each project recommended for USTDA’s further consideration.  The DM consultant will evaluate associated preliminary environmental impacts of each project.  Developmental impacts and measurement factors will be addressed for each project.  The potential for U.S. exports and impacts upon U.S. labor will also be issues under review for each project.

During the course of the DM consultant’s preparatory research, the consultant shall review the status of other exchanges in sub-Saharan Africa and recommend to USTDA as to whether the agency ought to develop an assistance plan to those other exchanges.

Annex I

IMPACT ON U.S. LABOR STATEMENT

The Foreign Operations, Export Financing and Related Programs Appropriations legislation restricts U.S. foreign assistance from being used to provide: (a) any financial incentive to a business enterprise currently located in the United States for the purpose of inducing such an enterprise to relocate outside the United States if such incentive or inducement is likely to reduce the number of employees of such business enterprise in the United States because United States production is being replaced by such enterprise outside the United States; (b) assistance for any project or activity that contributes to the violation of internationally recognized workers rights; and (c) direct assistance for establishing or expanding production of any commodity for export by any country other than the United States, if the commodity is likely to be in surplus on world markets at the time the resulting productive capacity is expected to become operative and if the assistance will cause substantial injury to United States producers of the same, similar, or competing commodity. 

 
Annex II

USTDA Nationality Requirements

The purpose of USTDA's nationality, source, and origin requirements is to assure the maximum practicable participation of American contractors, technology, equipment and materials in the pre-feasibility, feasibility, and implementation stages of a project.


USTDA STANDARD RULE (GRANT AGREEMENT STANDARD LANGUAGE):

Except as USTDA may otherwise agree, the following provisions shall govern the delivery of goods and services funded by USTDA under this Grant Agreement: (a) for professional services, the Contractor must be either a U.S. firm or U.S. consultant; (b) the Contractor may use U.S. subcontractors without limitation, but the use of subcontractors from host country may not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the USTDA Grant amount and may only be used for specific services from the Terms of Reference identified in the subcontract; (c) employees of U.S. Contractor or U.S. subcontractor firms responsible for professional services shall be U.S. citizens or non-U.S. citizens lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S.; (d) goods purchased for implementation of the Study and associated delivery services (e.g., international transportation and insurance) must have their nationality, source and origin in the United States; and (e) goods and services incidental to Study support (e.g., lodging, food, and transportation) in host country are not subject to the above restrictions. USTDA will make available further details concerning these standards of eligibility upon request.

NATIONALITY:
1.	Rule

Except as USTDA may otherwise agree, the Contractor for USTDA funded activities must be either a U.S. firm or a U.S. consultant. Prime contractors may utilize U.S. subcontractors, but the use of host country subcontractors is limited to 20% of the USTDA grant amount.
2.	Application

Accordingly, only a U.S. firm or U.S. consultant may submit proposals on USTDA-funded activities. Although those proposals may include subcontracting arrangements with host country firms or individuals for up to 20% of the USTDA grant amount, they may not include subcontracts with third country entities. U.S. firms submitting proposals must ensure that the professional services funded by the USTDA grant, to the extent not subcontracted to host country entities, are supplied by employees of the firm or employees of U.S. subcontractor firms who are U.S. individuals. 

Interested U.S. firms and consultants who submit proposals must meet USTDA nationality requirements as of the due date for the submission of proposals and, if selected, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. These nationality provisions apply to whatever portion of the Terms of Reference is funded with the USTDA grant. 
3.	Definitions

A "U.S. individual" is (a) a U.S. citizen, or (b) a non-U.S. citizen lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S. (a green card holder).

A "U.S. consultant" is (a) a U.S. citizen whose principal place of business is in the United States, or (b) a non-U.S. citizen lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S. (a green card holder) whose principal place of business is in the U.S.

Guidance on USTDA Development Impact Measures

USTDA has a dual mission of promoting US exports and advancing economic development in the host country.  USTDA would like to re-emphasize the Agency’s developmental mandate.  Toward this goal, the Agency is collecting more detailed information regarding the impact of its activities on the economic development of the host country.

What does USTDA mean by Development Impact?
USTDA’s activities impact host country economic development in a variety of ways.  There are four primary categories that are tracked and measured.  However, the Agency recognizes that there are additional ways that activities can benefit the host country.  Therefore, study contractors are encouraged to address any significant benefits. 

Category	Explanation
Infrastructure	USTDA funds feasibility studies of and technical assistance for many critically important infrastructure projects such as power plants, roads, ports, airports, telecommunications systems, water and sewerage systems or environmental improvements or enhancements, as well as projects such as refineries and manufacturing plants.  Implementation of these projects contributes to the improvement and security of the physical, financial and social infrastructure of the developing world.  
Market-Oriented Reform	Many USTDA activities have as a primary objective the facilitation of market-oriented reforms in developing countries. These reforms include encouraging more transparent regulatory systems and institutions, privatization of state-owned economic entities, promotion of greater competition in non-competitive economic sectors, lowering of non-tariff barriers to trade, strengthening of intellectual property rights and modernizing international trade systems and regulations.  
Human Capacity Building	When implemented, the Agency’s projects often create new job opportunities, sustain employment for those in jeopardy of losing jobs and/or offer advanced training to upgrade the capability of the work force.  USTDA considers a project to have Human Capacity Building impact if ten or more jobs are created and/or ten or more people receive significant training.
Technology Transfer and Productivity Improvement	The Agency’s projects result in the introduction of advanced technologies (e.g. management information systems or process technologies) or licenses that improve processes and/or systems , resulting in greater economic productivity or more efficient use of resources.
Other	Other development benefits not captured by the above four categories - examples include enhanced government revenue, increased good governance or spin-off projects.






 
How Should the TOR of the FS/TA Address Development Impact?

The TOR should include a task that assesses the expected development benefits of the proposed project.  For example:

The FS/TA Contractor shall report on the potential Development Impact of the project in the host country.  In this section, the FS/TA Contractor should focus on what the economic development outcomes will be if the project is implemented according to the study recommendations.    While specific focus should be paid to the immediate impact of the specific project that is being considered, the FS/TA contractor should include, where appropriate, any additional developmental benefits to the project, including spin-off and demonstration effects.  The analysis of potential benefits of the feasibility study contractor should be as concrete and detailed as possible.  The Development Impact factors are intended to provide the project’s decision-makers and interested parties with a broader view of the project’s potential effects on the host country.  The FS/TA contractor will provide estimates of the project’s potential benefits in the following areas: 

·	Infrastructure: a statement on the infrastructure impact giving a brief synopsis.  For example “This project would result in the construction of a power plant that would provide 500MW of power.  This plant would serve x additional households in the region.”

·	Market-Oriented Reform: a description of any regulation, laws, or institutional changes that are recommended and the effect they would have if implemented.

·	Human Capacity Building:  The Contractor should address the number and type of positions that would be needed to construct and operate the proposed project as well as the number of people who will receive training and a brief description of the training program.

·	Technology Transfer and Productivity Enhancement: a description of any advanced technologies that will be implemented as a result of the project.  A description of any efficiency that will be gained (e.g. “By upgrading the power plant’s old boilers, efficiency will be increased from x% to y%).

·	Other: any other developmental benefits to the project, including any spin-off or demonstration effects.

 
How Will This Affect the Final Report For the FS or TA?  

·	A section in the final report will be devoted to the projected host country Development Impact of the FS or TA recommendations if they are implemented.  The section should focus primarily on the key issues mentioned above (infrastructure and industrialization, human capacity building, technology transfer and productivity, and market oriented reform).  Other host country development impacts (e.g. improved financial revenue flows to host government etc.) can be mentioned where appropriate.  The discussion should be as detailed and concrete as possible, and the contractor may provide estimates in ranges as appropriate.
