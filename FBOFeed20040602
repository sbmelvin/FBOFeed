<SUBJECT>59 -- THE JOINT INTERFACE CONTROL OFFICE (JICO) SUPPORT SYSTEM (JSS)
<SOLNBR>FA8725-04-R-0004
<RESPDATE>120103
<CONTACT>Kent.Kinal@hanscom.af.mil
<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.  This Sources Sought Synopsis is in support of a market survey being conducted by the Air Force to identify potential sources capable of executing the Joint Interface Control Office (JICO) Support System (JSS) program. System Description The JSS will provide the JICO with ability to manage the Joint Multi-Tactical Data Link Network (MTN) and overcome Joint and combined interface deficiencies related to the planning and management of the Joint MTN.  The Joint MTN consists of the Tactical Data Links (TDLs) and participating nodes (also known as the Multi-TDL Architecture or MTA), and the data flowing therein.  The JSS will be an independent system and will not initially be integrated into other tactical systems. The JSS will consist of a common set of hardware and software, recognizable and operable irrespective of the OPFAC in which it is placed.  The system will be operated and maintained by trained JICC personnel.  While it is recognized that this requirement levies additional space and lift requirements on host OPFACS, it ensures that across the Joint battlefield, one system designed specifically to contribute to interoperability is itself interoperable.  As part of the life-cycle maintenance process the JSS program office will develop updated and certified software packages through an established Configuration Control Board process.  Once the software package has been tested and verified it will be readied and delivered for use in all the JSS systems in accordance with the Program Management Plan (PMP). The JSS will aid the JICO organization in the planning and management of the MTN in the full spectrum of operations, from peacetime training to deliberate war/crisis operations.  The JSS will provide a JSS Data Repository (JDR) from which the JSS can access existing MTAs, Link-16 network designs/descriptions and other MTN related planning and management items.  The JSS will have access to a local JDR database as well as a remote JDR database.   The remote JDR database will provide data to various deployed JSS systems and will be a master repository for MTN planning and management information. The JSS has no associated sensors and it will function much like any other interface unit (IU) in the MTN.  The JSS will operate in an environment where individual nodes (ships, airplanes, and C2 sites) are not the systems with which it interfaces; rather, it will act upon the data links directly.  The JSS aids the JICO in collaborative planning through communications interfaces with the JPN and GCCS, and through a link to the remote JICO Data Repository (JDR), in addition to interacting with other JSS-equipped OPFACs in the JOA.  The JICO will exercise authority within the MTN using both voice communications and TDL-specific management messages.  The backbone of the MTN is the Link-16 network; the JICO will interact within the RF environment (ideally) or via Beyond Line of Sight (BLOS) means.  The JSS will enable the JICO to assume a forwarding role, enabling data transfer and translation among all eligible components of the MTN.  The JSS will plan for and statically manage gateway entry points of the Ground Digital Network (VMF messages) and the Intelligence Network (IBS). Scope of Effort The duration of the contract runs from FY04 to FY09.  The JSS contractor will provide system engineering design, engineering analysis, software development, software/hardware integration, system testing, support for certification testing, training, operational support during exercises and system installation support, life cycle support concept, security, training, and production deliverables.  The contractor will be required to develop JSS software in accordance with the Open Architecture, message standards (6011,6016), extensible, support information assurance and security.  The JSS capabilities will be provided in 3 blocks.  Each block will be developed, factory and field tested, produced, and installed. Prior blocks will be upgraded to the subsequent block. A tentative production plan is provided below. USAF Fielded Deliverables Block 1 (FY05-FY06)  9 Common Core Capability (CCCs) and 1 CCC spare and training for 9 units Block 2 (FY06-FY07)  9 CCCs and 10 Block 1 to Block 2 upgrades and training for 9 Block 2s and delta training for 9 Block 1 to Block 2 upgrades.

<DESC>C-Architect-Engineer Services Solicitation # GS-04P-04-EXC-0032 – Greenville, South Carolina, GSA contracting officer phone number - 404-331-4616.

Continuing a centuries-old legacy of extraordinary public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission our nation’s most talented architects to design Federal buildings of outstanding quality and value, buildings that provide superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees as well as give contemporary form and meaning to our democratic values.  In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design for a New U. S. Federal Courthouse to be constructed in Greenville, South Carolina in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements.  The building is approximately 21 158 gross square meters (gsm)  227,747 gross square feet (gsf) without parking, and approximately 23 908 gsm  257,347 gsf including 74 interior parking spaces.  The proposed courthouse will provide a total of eight (8) courtrooms: - six (6) district, and two (2) magistrate courtrooms.  The building will house the Circuit, District, and Magistrate Courts; U. S. Attorney; U. S. Marshals Service; U. S. Probation; U. S. Pretrial Service; Public Defenders; and GSA.  The proposed facility will be constructed in Greenville, SC with the exact site still to be determined.  The Estimated Construction Cost range is approximately $45 million to $55 million 

The facility will be designed in metric units.  The scope of work will require at a minimum:  metric construction drawings, specifications, cost estimates, schedules, value engineering services, life cycle costing, space planning, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD) and construction phase services (option to be exercised at a later date) for a facility that includes the construction of a new building and related systems, inside parking, site development, client program requirements, and sustainable features.  The facility must be designed to meet the energy goal established by GSA.  The building is also to include the GSA design standards for secure facilities; Facilities Standard for the Public Buildings Services; the Courts Design Guide requirements; the U. S. Marshal’s design requirements, the U. S. Attorney’s Office design requirements and any other agency specific guidelines as part of the design. The design of the facility shall include sustainable design and construction practices following the LEED format and will incorporate total building commissioning as defined by GSA design guides.  GSA will contract separately during the design phase for Construction Management (CM) and/or Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) services.

Details and procedures for the design charette will be provided to the firms selected to participate in Stage II.  The submitted design concepts become the property of the government and may or may not be the basis, in whole or in part, for the development of the final building design.  It is important that the charette vision must be within the realistic range of the project budget.  The submitted design charrette concepts become the property of the Government.  The design charrette proposals will be used in conjunction with Stage II interview rankings in the final evaluation of the A/E firms to select the winning A/E Firm.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  The National Diabetes Prevention Center (NDPC), Program Development Branch, Division of Diabetes Translation, CDC, is providing information as to a potential sole source action to the UNM Native American Diabetes Program for the update and revision of the Strong in Body and Spirit and Partners In Care curricula.  

BACKGROUND:  The National Diabetes Prevention Center (NDPC), Program Development Branch, Division of Diabetes Translation, CDC, is a congressionally mandated program to determine and disseminate “what works” in diabetes treatment and prevention in Native American communities. The NDPC goals include developing and adapting culturally appropriate and valid tools, instruments and materials for diabetes prevention in American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) communities. 

The UNM Native American Diabetes Programs was the creator of the Strong in Body and Spirit and Partners in Care curricula. The UNM Native American Diabetes Programs: 1) was directly involved in the original development and testing (including pilot testing) of both the Strong in Body and Spirit and Partners in Care curricula; 2) has extensive experience in training tribal communities in the use of both the Strong in Body and Spirit and Partners in Care curricula and disseminating the curricula to tribal communities nationwide; 3) maintains current and direct experience in contracting with the American Diabetes Association (ADA) to provide tribal community trainings in the use of the Strong in Body and Spirit curriculum through the ADA Awakening the Spirit outreach program; 4) possesses extensive and current experience in the use of storytelling to design diabetes prevention and treatment curricula for Native American communities; 5) operates as a multi-disciplinary team that includes (but is not limited to) American Indians, specifically, as well as multi-cultural persons who have lived and worked in Indian Country for a long time. Professional disciplines comprising the team include physicians, exercise physiologists, a registered dietitian who is also a CDE, individuals with previous experience as tribal community health representatives, diabetes curriculum development experts, and health behavior interventionists; (6) conducted the original evaluation of the curricula.

PURPOSE:  This acquisition seeks to update the Strong in Body and Spirit and Partners in Care curricula. These curricula were developed in 1992 and 1998 respectively. The curricula have been rigorously evaluated and accepted for use in Native American communities nationwide. Since their creation there have been many new clinical developments that need to be integrated to enhance and update the curricula and assure their continued relevance.  

SPECIFIC TASKS TO BE PERFORMED
1.	Researching clinical updates and information specifically pertinent to the curricula content from various health behaviors, medical and clinical sources. To accomplish this, the contractor must recognize and have specific experience with the content and Native American cultural context of the curricula, as developed; 
2.	Revising and translating the curricula to a culturally appropriate framework, with input from clinical experts, Native American sources and staff for use in community-based programs. To accomplish this, the contractor must have current and considerable experience with Native American culture, learning patterns/processes, behavior change determinants, and evaluating tribal community cultural adoptability and acceptability of these curricula; 
3.	Updating the UNM NADP website to include curricula revisions. This website is the designated and nationally recognized internet resource for these curricula. Provide the updated curricula in various forms for use (e.g., CD-ROM, paper, PDF format); 
4.	Providing a final report of the activities undertaken to accomplish this action, including guidelines for an external evaluation and dissemination plan for the updated curricula. Delivery date for the final report is one year after award.

Through this announcement, alternate sources are being offered the opportunity to demonstrate their capabilities to provide the services specifically identified above.   
To be considered qualified, sources must submit a capabilities statement which demonstrates in writing that they possess at least 12 years of experience in using the two respective curricula in community-based Native American diabetes prevention programs; have intimate experience with these curricula in the development of Native American storytelling and other culturally appropriate formats for delivering health and health behavior information in order to integrate material updates; have direct access to the designated and nationally recognized internet resource for these curricula; have the professional staffing resources to accomplish the activities outlined in the SOW. Responses must contain no more than 10 pages total. 

Qualified organizations are encouraged to submit a capabilities statement which addresses the requirements and contains material in sufficient detail to allow the CDC to determine if the party can perform this requirement. Capabilities are to be received in the contracting office no later than fifteen (15) days from the date of this announcement. Submit written information to:  Margaret Mooney, MS-P05, Reference: MLM0000HCL4-04-08895, CDC/PGO/AAFB, 626 Cochrans Mill Road, PO Box 18070, Pittsburgh, PA  15236-0070 or responses may be submitted electronically to Margaret Mooney at zia3@cdc.gov 

The intent of this synopsis is to determine whether alternative sources exist. Information received will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All responsible sources may submit a response, which shall be considered by the Agency.

EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) (FAR 52.212-2)   (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will b e most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:    EVALUATION FACTORS  	 Factor 1 – Past Performance 	 Factor 2 – Price  Factor 1 and factor 2 are equally important.       Factor 1 – PAST PERFORMANCE    During the source selection process, the Government will assess the offeror's past performance in the evaluation for contract award.  Accordingly, each offeror is required to submit a list of up to five of its most recent contracts within the past three years, either completed or on-going, for the same/similar products or services. It is preferred that these contracts be with U.S. Government customers, but contracts with other commercial concerns are also acceptable.   Offerors are authorized to provide information relative to any problems encountered on the identified contracts and any c orrective actions taken by the offeror.  The Source Selection Authority (SSA)/Contracting Officer will evaluate the offeror's past performance based upon the information furnished by the offeror and/or other information obtained by the Contracting Officer.  The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating or securing any information not furnished with the offer.  The SSA/Contracting Officer may, however, utilize all available information, including information not provided by the offeror, in the past performance evaluation.  The Government reserves the right to review less than all information submitted, and to only analyze sufficient information to make a reasonable determination of each offeror’s past performance rating. Past performance is assessed by the SSA/Contracting Officer and is assigned a narrative rating in the evaluation.  Each offeror will be given an adje ctival rating on past performance: highly favorable, favorable, neither favorable nor unfavorable, unfavorable, highly unfavorable, or no same or similar history.  Offerors who do not have same or similar past performance information reasonably available to the Contracting Officer will not be rated either favorable or unfavorable.  The Government reserves the right to award to other than the lowest priced offer as set forth elsewhere in the solicitation.  In addition, the Government may accept other than the lowest priced offer if doing so would result in greater value to the Government in terms of technical performance, quality, reliability, life cycle cost, or lower overall program risk.   As a part of the past performance evaluation, the Government will assess the offeror's previous compliance with the requirements of FAR 52.219-8 and 52.219-9 as applicable.   Factor 2  – P RICE EVALUATION   Price will not be rated but will be considered in determining the “best value” to the Government.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City, Panama City FL intends to issue a sole source contract to BAE Systems Inc, 450 Pulaski Road, Greenlawn NY 11740-1606 for four each AN/VRC-99B© radios, BAE part number 1051054G-4. The radios will be used in the testing and deployment of the AN/WLD-1(V)1 Remote Minehunting System. The AN/VRC-99B© radio is used as part of the communications subsystem used to control the Remote Minehunting Vehicle (RMV). It is part of the Line-of-Sight (LOS) link hardware that is used to control the RMV at ranges of up to 14 nautical miles. This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. The AV/VRC-99B© radio as manufactured by BAE Systems is an integral part of the RMS DLS subsystem and is uniquely capable of operating with the existing hardware and software already designed into the system. Specific commands for r emote, automatic operation of the radio are incorporated into the existing system, requiring the identical radio for plug-and-play operation. Other features that are required for RMS operations include: Embedded encryption approved for SECRET level data transmission, operation in the 1.7 – 2.0 GHz radio frequency band used by the military, data rates up to 3.15 Mbps, and automatic network established of at least three radios. There are no other radio currently built that have such features and can operate with RMS off-the-shelf. Use of any other vendor would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that, given the limited number being acquired, would not be recovered through competition. Therefore, BAE Systems is uniquely qualified to provide the radios.  Delivery would be to the Naval Support Activity – Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Verno n Avenue, Panama City Beach, FL 32407-7018. NAICS Code 334220 applies.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC), National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), Office of Analysis and Epidemiology (OAE), Health Promotion Statistics Branch (HPSB), plans to conduct negotiations on a sole source basis with Maryanne Freedman, for a professional services contract to provide critical technical and statistical support for the development of the Healthy People 2010 Midcourse Review (MCR). HPSB provides statistical and technical support to the Office for Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (ODPHP) in the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, HHS. ODPHP is the HHS office responsible for coordinating Healthy People 2010 and is leading the MCR activity. 

Healthy People 2010 contains 467 objectives organized into 28 Focus Areas. The data for tracking the objectives come from 190 data sources; it is HPSB's responsibility to gather, interpret, disseminate and communicate the data. As the decade reaches the mid-point and Healthy People 2010 reaches the midcourse, there are several thousand data points to be reviewed and analyzed. The Midcourse Review (MCR) is an opportunity to verify that the objectives can be tracked, examine the trends for each objective, and assess the progress of the Healthy People 2010 objectives. The substantial breadth and depth of these tasks will require considerable technical and editorial expertise. 
The services requested will allow HPSB to create the drafts of the data-intensive portions of the MCR while the staff is still fully occupied with other vital Healthy People 2010 assignments, including briefings of the Assistant Secretary for Health and the NCHS Director, Progress Review production, and gathering data before the 12/31/04 MCR data cutoff. In addition, considerable assistance will be required for editing the text portions of the MCR and other data-related functions during the period of the contract. 
OBJECTIVE: The objective is to engage the services of an individual with knowledge of both the conceptual framework of Healthy People 2010 and the technical expertise in health data and the expertise to communicate statistical information to health professionals and the public. The Contractor will complement the analytical and subject expertise of HPSB staff and provide a high-level, overall view of the content as well as statistical and editorial support for the creation of the Healthy People 2010 MCR products. 
 
SCOPE OF WORK: In order to achieve the objective, the following activities will be carried out under the contract: 
Task 1-0 Kick-off meeting 
The Contractor shall meet with the HPSB to confirm the tasks and timeframe for the scope of work. 
Task 2-0 Review, rewrite, and edit Parts A and C of Tracking Healthy People (THP). 
Part A of THP, "General Data Issues," contains detailed information regarding population estimates, missing data, State and local data, and variability. The Contractor will review the 50-page section, ascertain which issues have changed, update and rewrite when necessary, and edit the section. Part C of THP, "Major Data Sources," contains descriptions of 23 data systems; the content and coverage of these sources may have changed over time, thereby affecting the measurement of Healthy People 2010 objectives. The Contractor will review the data source descriptions, update, and rewrite as needed. 
Task 3-0 Edit Part B and the List of Tables and Figures of Tracking Healthy People. 
Part B of Tracking Healthy People, "Operational Definitions," is comprised of 28 chapters organized by Focus Area, and contains details for each objective, including national data source, state data source, measure, baseline, numerator, denominator, and more. During the MCR, many objectives will change; developmental objectives will become measurable, data sources and baselines will change, and objectives will be dropped. The THP chapters will be rewritten by eight different analysts. The Contractor will edit the chapters for technical content and overall clarity. 
Task 4-0 Produce Templates for Progress Quotient and Disparity Measurement charts and tables for each Focus Area. 
The purpose of the MCR is to report progress toward the Healthy People 2010 goals and objectives at the midpoint of the decade. Progress quotient and disparity charts and table templates will be produced for each focus area chapter. The Contractor shall work with HPSB to develop and refine the components of the charts. 
Task 5-0 Produce Progress Quotient and Disparity measurement charts and tables. The Contractor, working with the templates produced in Task 4, shall produce the final progress quotient and disparity measurement charts and tables for each focus area. 
Task 6-0 Design and Produce MCR Appendix contents. 
The Contractor shall design and produce the technical notes and appendices tables that will provide additional information on the measurement of progress and health disparities. 
Task 7-0 Review and Edit MCR publication front materials for goals 1 and 2. The Contractor shall edit the goals section of the MCR text to provide consistency of format and writing style. 
Task 8-0 Edit MCR focus area chapter text. 
The Contractor shall edit the MCR chapter text for each focus area, assuring consistency of format and writing style. This task is crucial in light of the fact that each of the 28 focus areas will have a different author. 
Task 9-0 Review and edit final clearance version of MCR. 
The Contractor shall edit the MCR goals section, chapter text for each focus area, and appendices, ensuring consistency of format and writing style. Significant attention to detail will be needed to ensure consistency throughout the MCR, and the incorporation of public comments. 
Task 10-0 Review and edit final MCR 
The Contractor shall edit all changed portions of the text, ensuring the 
incorporation of the HHS-wide clearance comments while maintaining consistency of format and style. This task is expected to be performed under severe time constraints. 
Task 11-0 Produce Summary Report (i.e., Statistical Note) 
The Contractor will prepare a summary report (i.e., Statistical Note) of the changes accomplished during the MCR, including significant changes to the data definitions, objectives that have been dropped, changed re-worded, and added.

<DESC>POC: Evangela Kunene, Procurement Data Manager, Tel: 703-875-4357, Fax: 703-875-4009, E-mail: ekunene@tda.gov  :  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE  :  Proposal Submission Place:  State Oil Fund of Azerbaijan, c/o U.S. Trade and Development Agency, 1000 Wilson Blvd., Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209, Attention: Institutional Capacity Building for the State Oil Fund of Azerbaijan  :  The State Oil Fund of Azerbaijan (SOFAZ) invites submission of Proposals from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to conduct technical assistance on asset management.  The technical assistance will include reviewing and refining SOFAZ’s current asset and risk management guidelines and policies; selection and implementation of portfolio management software; legal support; and developing an operations manual for SOFAZ. 

In December of 1999, the Government of Azerbaijan created SOFAZ in order to accumulate and manage oil-related revenue and maintain it for the purposes of future generations.  SOFAZ became operational in September of 2001 after its statutory regulations, asset management guidelines and budget rules were put into effect.  The Government of Azerbaijan charged SOFAZ with the following strategic objectives: (1) prevention of severe macroeconomic distortions that might be caused by excessive hard currency inflows; (2) assuring the fair distribution of petroleum wealth within Azerbaijan and for future generations; (3) managing SOFAZ’s assets to yield incremental income; and (4) directing a portion of its assets to implementing priority social and investment projects in Azerbaijan.

Since its inception, SOFAZ has received over $1.1 billion in revenues and incurred expenditures of only $300 million, leaving assets in excess of $800 million.  Annual revenues between 2004 and 2006 are expected to range between $150 million and $170 million, while as a result of the commissioning of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline and the Baku-Tbilisi-Erzerum gas export pipelines, revenues will increase substantially after 2006.  Revenue from the Azeri-Chirag-Guneshly oilfield alone is expected to exceed $25 billion over the next 25 years.  SOFAZ has recognized that it needs assistance in developing its human resources and institutional capacity in order to undertake managing these windfalls.

In February of 2004, the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) funded a Desk Study to review the proposed technical assistance.  The aim of the technical assistance is to help SOFAZ strengthen its asset and risk management policies and capabilities.

The U.S. firm selected to conduct this technical assistance will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $1,091,840 grant to SOFAZ from USTDA.  



 




A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP) is available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Blvd., Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mailroom before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or Azerbaijan.   The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host countries for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal to SOFAZ c/o USTDA by 4:00 P.M. July 7, 2004, at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  SOFAZ reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  SOFAZ also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  SOFAZ is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) hereby issues a Request for Information (RFI) to identify sources with innovative and cost effective solutions to satisfy a need for spectrum management support (SMS) to the Defense Spectrum Office (DSO). ..........  This announcement is an RFI only, and not a Request for Proposal (RFP). When there is any further development in the project, a formal RFP will be issued. ..........  This RFI is a request for interested parties that may be able to provide the required spectrum management support to the DSO to describe their capabilities to respond to the requirements described below and provide a rough-order-of-magnitude (ROM) cost for such services. Industry responses will be used by the Government to assess feasibility, technical solutions and acquisition approaches for proceeding on the SMS. ..........  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for information received in responses.  The point of contact (POC) for technical issues is Mr. Stuart Timerman, DSO Program Manager, at  email timermas@ncr.disa.mil.  The POC for contractual issues is Ms. Nancy McClain, Contracting Officer, email mcclainn@ncr.disa.mil. ..........  The SMS project is a method of acquiring technical support services to assist the DSO in fulfilling its mission responsibilities.  The support services will be performed at a government site in northern Virginia and portions of the work may be performed at the contractors facilities.  All contractor personnel must possess a TOP SECRET clearance prior to task assignment. ..........  The objective of the DSO program is to support the Office of the Assistance Secretary of Defense for Networks and Information Integration (OASD/NII) in the development of policies and plans to ensure that DoD can meet its spectrum needs and to assure spectrum access to our warfighters. Strategic planning and roadmapping of regulatory activities and technology are integral to the development of DoD policies. .......... Any future solicitation and subsequent contract on this program will be for spectrum management support (SMS) to the DSO. This program encompasses all national and International activities associated with the DoD spectrum Policy and Planning, including the World Radio Conference (WRC), assessment of impact of commercial technology encroachments into DoD spectrum on DoD operations, study and development of efficient and state-of-the-art technology to increase the efficient and effective use of the electromagnetic spectrum, and to devise strategies to help in furthering DoD’s spectrum management interests both nationally and internationally. ..........  The DISA Defense Spectrum Office provides long-term, comprehensive and strategic planning to assure DoD’s access to spectrum.  The DSO provides and/or coordinates the analytical support, coordinates all joint spectrum management matters, develops DoD spectrum policy that ensures consistent enforcement of spectrum management policy and procedures DoD-wide, and is responsible for the development of efficient spectrum management processes using advanced technology and spectrum management techniques required to ensure DoD global spectrum access in the 21st century.  These responsibilities also include the rectification of both technical and policy issues associated with electromagnetic spectrum and the national and international allocation and assignment of spectrum. ..........  The DSO is primarily comprised of three organizational teams, National, International, and Emerging Technology.  For each team to successfully perform their roles and responsibilities within their respective domains, there are key functions executed to develop the planning, formulate the required product/message/response, and to engage and participate in the appropriate forums.  These functions have been identified within this SOW to be represented within three primary functional areas: Strategic Planning, DoD Outreach and Systems Engineering. ..........  Interested parties responding to this RFI are invited to prepare a white paper and address suggestions to perform the tasks identified and submit them NLT 7 June 2004.

<DESC>The USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS) Sugarcane Field Station, Canal Point, FL,  requires a GV 2003 IRMS mass spectrometer for its research.   For this acquisition, ARS intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis with Elementar Americas, Inc., of Mt. Laurel, NJ.  Personnel at the Sugarcane Field Station have determined that the spectrometer hardware must be fully compatible with the existing Vario Max C/N Elementar Analyzer hardware; the mass spectrometer software must fully integrate with the existing Elementar Analyzer software; it must operate sequentially with the Elementar Analyzer and must not void the warranty of the existing Analyzer.  This is the only known spectrometer that will satisfy these requirements.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, the Government will consider all responses received within 15 days of publication of this synopsis.  Therefore, interested persons may identify their capability and respond to the requirement no later than 2:00 p.m. EST on June 18, 2004, to Pat Jones, fax number (706) 546-3444.   Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 334516.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<CONTACT>Kent Kinal, 781-377-1273, Kent.Kinal@hanscom.af.mil
<DESC>This NOCA does not constitute a Request for Proposals (RFP) nor an Invitation for Bids (IFB). It does not restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach nor should the Government construe it as a commitment.  Furthermore, potential offerors are reminded and cautioned that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.  The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this notice, nor will it reimburse the contractor for costs, if any, associated with this NOCA.  This NOCA constitutes an announcement to all potential offerors that the Tactical Data Links (TDL), Gateways, and Network Management System Program Office (TGN SPO), Network Management Division (NI3N), Electronic Systems Center, Hanscom AFB, MA  01731 intends to issue on or about 8 March, 2004 a Request for Proposals  (RFP) (RFP Number: FA8725-04-R-0004) for the Joint Interface Control Officer (JICO) Support System (JSS). The TGN SPO, along with its partner organizations intends to conduct a full and open competition utilizing FAR Part 15 and best value evaluation criteria for the acquisition. The overall objective of JSS program is to provide support to the Joint Interface Control Officer (JICO) and JICO Cell with an Automated Tool Set for Planning, Management, and Execution of the Multi-TADIL Network (MTN), automated Track Data Management, TDL Coordination and Management and Voice and Data Communications. The JSS will be acquired through a three-phased effort.  Phase 1 is anticipated to consist a six-month effort to develop an EDM (Engineering Development Model) unit for JSS with minimal implementation of requirements, which will be listed in the TRD.  Cost for Phase 1 will be based on a firm fixed-pricing.  Phase 2 will consist of the completion of the development of the unit with all threshold requirements on a cost-plus-award fee basis.  Phase 3 will consist of production on a firm fixed-price basis and sustainment on a time-and-materials basis. Selection of Phase 1 contractors is expected to result in award of two (2) or three (3) contracts, with down-selection to one contractor for Phases 2 and 3.   Initial proposals will be submitted using a split submission process.  The Government reserves the right to award more, less, or no contracts at all depending on the quality of the proposals received.  The government reserves the right to award without discussion. Each offeror selected for Phase 1 contract award will be required to deliver (DD Form 250) two (2) complete Phase 1 units with critical sparing at the end of a 6 month time frame based on the requirements for Phase 1.  The government will use these units during a demonstration/training (accomplished by the contractor) and evaluation phase (accomplished by the government). Each offeror will also be required to submit (upon delivery of the EDM units listed in Phases 1); a complete proposal; e.g. any final change pages to its technical proposal, and a full cost proposal based on the final version of its technical proposal after the development phase of Phase 1 and before the oral/demonstration and evaluation. Information exchanges and associated acquisition history of JSS are posted to the ESC HANSCOM AFB, MA electronic bulletin board (https://herbb.hanscom.af.mil) and the Government Point of Entry (GPE), FedBizOps (http://www.fedbizopps.gov).  Potential offerors shall monitor HERBB and/or the GPE for future information exchanges and the anticipated RFP.  Offerors will be provided 30 days from official release to respond to the RFP.  Telephone requests for the RFP will not be accepted. Firms responding to the RFP shall indicate whether they are a large business, small business, very small business, small-disadvantaged business, 8(a) concern, women-owned business, HUBZone small business, veteran-owned small business, or service-disabled veteran-owned small business.  The applicable North American Industrial Classification system (NAICS) code is  334220. Respondents must specify whether they are a U.S. or foreign-owned firm. Interested Contractors desiring to do business with the Air Force shall be registered in the DoD Central Contracting Reporting System.  Interested offerors who have Advisory and Assistance Services contracts and also support ESC/TGN are put on notice that the potential for an Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) may exist. If an offeror desires to submit a proposal in response to the above RFP, an OCI mitigation plan will be required. This plan will be evaluated to determine if an actual OCI exists and whether sufficient safeguards exist that render the offeror eligible for award. Under some circumstances, an OCI mitigation plan may not be sufficient to correct an OCI, so submitting an OCI mitigation plan does not guarantee that a company will be successful in mitigating an OCI. Failure to submit such a plan when an OCI is present will render the offeror ineligible for award. Similarly, failure to mitigate an OCI will also render an offeror ineligible for award.  Offerors are requested to submit an OCI mitigation plan, if appropriate, to the contracting officer prior to RFP release. Offerors are requested to submit past performance information 15 days prior to the date set for receipt of proposals. Please direct any questions on this NOCA to ESC/TGN, 45 Arnold Street, Hanscom AFB MA 01731-2103, Attn: Mr. Kent Kinal, Contracting Officer (tel: 781-377-1273, e-mail: kent.kinal@hanscom.af.mil) or Mr. Jeff Wong, Contracts Manager (tel: 781-377-2326, e-mail: Jeffrey.wong@hanscom.af.mil).

<DESC>NAICS Code: 421440   MODIFICATION 2  CHANGES ITEM 24 TO AN ACCESSORY AND MOVES INSTRUCTIONS TO ITEM 24.  ATTACHED ARE THE RESPONSES TO QUESTIONS SUBMITTED ON OR BEFORE MAY 28, 2004.  THESE CAN ALSO BE VIEWED AT  http://www.epa.gov/oam/srpod/index.htm QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS IN RESPONSE TO  INQUIRES FOR RFQ-DC-04-00184 DECON SHELTER SYSTEM 1.	How do I get the plans/ specifications for project # RFQ-DC-04-00184? 	Answer: 	The plans for the DeCon Shelter System are described in the Request for Quotes posted on the EPA website at http://www.epa.gov/oam/srpod/index.htm listed  under Solicitations and Amendments, DeCon Shelter System which will link to the Solicitation and Attachment 1 providing the drawings. 2.	My company produces a mass decontamination water deployment system this unit will attach directly to any 2.5 inch discharge in less than 30 seconds. We also have  an expanded shower area making the decontamination process more effective for the masses.  Please let me know if the bid would include my product. 	Answer: 	The Evaluation Factors for Award Clause states a vendor must demonstrate how the proposed item meets the Specifications as identified in the  RFQ.  It is the intent of the Government to make award to individual or multiple vendors whose quote(s) represent the best value to the Government, price and other related factors considered for the items referenced in the RFQ. Vendors must also respond to "Additional Instructions To Vendors" as  stated in the RFQ. 3.	On what date do you expect to award any contract resulting from this RFQ? 	Answer: 	EPA anticipates making award of the Blanket Purchase Agreement on or around by June 15, 2004. 4.	Is there any possibility the required delivery date of 7/9/04 could be moved further into  the future? 	Answer: 	July 9, 2004 has been established as the need date. The ability to meet this date will be part of the technical evaluation of company's ability to respond to the requirement of the RFQ-DC-04-00184. 5.	The presolicitation Notice for this RFQ states that the deadline for  submitting a quote is June 4, 2004. The RFQ says the deadline for submitting a quote is 06/09/2004. Which is the correct response date? 	Answer: 	Modification 01 to the synopsis, which was issued on May 24, 2004 changed the quote receipt date to 06/09/2004 and changed the delivery date of the  DeCon shelter to 07/09/2004. These are the most current dates. 6.  	I have reviewed the RFQ for a Decontamination Shelter System for the EPA. Are the specifications taken from a specific manufacturer, and if so, who? Or are these specs for a hybrid system based on a design put together by the  EPA? 	Answer: 	Specifications in RFQ-DC-04-00184 are stated to meet EPA's minimum requirements.   Vendors are encouraged to use their expertise in meeting these requirements. Each submission will be evaluated as to how effectively they meet the stated requirements of the RFQ. 7.	Will the BPA be  restricted to EPA organizations only or will other agencies, that are pertinent to the EPA, will be able to purchase off this vehicle as well? 	Our BPAs are for the use of EPA authorized Personnel, which includes warranted Contracting Officers, Bankcard Holders, Warranted OSCs, START Contractors,  ERRS Contractors, ERT-GSA Contractors, and Border Contractors. A current list of authorized personnel can be viewed at the EPA website http://www.epa.gov/oamsrpod/ersc/bpa/authlist.pdf 8.	Has the EPA defined the types and composition of the "decon shelter systems" that will be in  demand? 	Answer: 	EPAs minimum requirements have been posted on our website at http://www.epa.gov/oam/srpod/index.htm under DeCon Shelter System. 9.	Will buying be centralized, or decontralized (a single Contracting Office for all purchases versus regional efforts). 	Answer: 	The Region making  the purchase will make the determination if they require assistance from Headquarters or plan to make the purchase from the Region. 10.	What purchase requirements will be confined to decon system unique items, or will the BPA also encompass things like protective suits and consumables?		 	All  items required for this BPA are items related to the DeCon Shelter System and are described in the RFQ. 11.	Should the quotation include shipping costs to one or more locations? 	Answer: 	Quotes for RFQ-DC-04-00184 should include all shipping and handling for FOB Destination. 12.	What form of  climate control, if any, should be included in the bid (as in air heaters, water heaters, air conditioning)? 	Answer: 	Items 15 and 16 request pricing for Air conditioning system, and duct work to cool tents during summer activities and Air Heating system and duct work to heat tents during winter  activities (New England Region). These are listed as Accessories and should be priced accordingly. However, these items MUST be compatible with the DeCon Shelter System. 13.	Are there any size or weight limitations to the shelters, either deployed size or storage size? For example, is there a  trailer or similar transportation conveyance in which they must fit?  	Answer: 	Item 1(4) and (5) states: Assumption: System to be stored/transported in Former EPA Radio Trailer. Entire system must be able to be stored/transported in box trailer (16 ft by 7 ft by 7.5 ft). Maximum allowable weight  for entire system 7,700 pounds. Able to withstand inclement weather (snow, wind, rain, heat, etc.) typical of New England region/area. 14.	Is the DeCon Shelter to be priced as one gross price? 	Answer: 	The RFQ request pricing for separate items or assemblies as well as accessories. You may  choose to submit a gross price however the RFQ will require individual pricing as well. 15.	Will one install team or multiple teams be used to assemble DeCon Shelter? 	Answer: 	Item 1(6) in the RFQ states: System must require no more than two (2) teams of four (4) trained staff to transport and  assemble full system in less than one-half hour. This includes assembly and connection of all accessories. What is the maximum number of people to plan training for? 	Answer: 	Item 2-10 of the RFQ States the manufacture representative must provide training to a minimum of eight (8) purchasing  party representatives at time of delivery (July 9, 2004). 16.	Is there a typographical error in item 2 # 12? Also is item 2 # 12 saying that the command shelter has to have the ability to be configured into a Decon Shelter? 	Answer: 	Item 2 # 12 of RFQ  - Statement referring to Hot water heater  should be deleted statement should read: 	Command Shelter must have flexible design to easily allow transformation of space into a minimum of 4 separate work areas - able to be easily reconfigured based on Site and EPA requirements. 	The Command Shelters are for command use and should be designed  in accordance with minimum requirements of item #7 of the RFQ. 17.	Please explain desired difference between "hard" and "soft" berms. 	Answer: 	The "hard" berm is the interior berm (can be fabric or hard materials) and is the primary containment for decon water for gross and rinse decon. The hard  berm is smaller and sits on top of the soft berms. 	The "soft" berm is the secondary containment berm to catch excess decon water, overspray and leakage from the hard berms. These berms are made of fabric that attaches to the tent itself to form a berm and will cover  majority of the interior of  each of the 2 wet tents and will catch any water that escapes from the hard berms. 	Both need to be able to handle decon solution, and be able to be decontaminated after use. 18.	Evaluation factors, Section III Price: 	1) What is the benefit to the Government of requesting that the pricing be in  accordance with standard price lists? Would more aggressive pricing be acceptable? 	2) Many of the items requested are modifications to standard products and threfore are not on our standard price list. What is the impact of this to evaluation factors score? 	Answer: 	1)  The vendor  standardprice list provides a representation as to the prices that are available to the general public for commercial items.  EPA may entertain aggressive pricing that would be advantageous to the government and will be evaluated with other factors as stated in the RFQ. 	2) Commercial items that  require minor modifications should be noted accordingly stating modifications required and reasons items do not appear on the price list. 19.	Does EPA have any idea how many decontamination units it wants to procure? 	Answer: 	One system is identified at this time. 20.	What is the significance  of the decontamination "shelter" system compared to the decontamination system? Are these the portable showers that can be set up at disaster sites or are they something else? 	Answer 	The decontamination shelter system or decontamination system for the purpose of this RFQ consist of all items and  accessories identified in the RFQ.. The portable showers is just one unit in the system. 22. 	As suggested in the presolicitation notice will the successful vendor be delivering the systems to the 12 cities listed? 	Answer: 	Any systems purchased will be shipped FOB Destination to the sites  identified on individual Purchase Orders. 23.	Does EPA intend to award a single contract or multiple contracts to more than one vendor? 	Answer: 	EPA will award BPA to a vendor or vendors that represents the best value to the government, price and other factors considered. 24.	With some  accessory items there could be a conflict between the quantity of items a manufacturer might offer to fulfill the written requirements of the RFQ and the quantity of items listed under the column called "quantity." Do we supply what is needed to fulfill the written description of requirements, or  the number listed in the quantity column? 	Answer: 	A vendor's offer should clearly demonstrate how their quote meets all minimum requirements of the RFQ. If a vendor feels they can meet the minimum requirements with different quantities it must be stated very clearly how the submitted quote meets  the minimum requirements with the proposed quantities.

<DESC>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) hereby issues a Request for Information (RFI) to identify sources with innovative and cost effective solutions to satisfy a need for spectrum management support (SMS) to the Defense Spectrum Office (DSO). ..........  This announcement is an RFI only, and not a Request for Proposal (RFP). When there is any further development in the project, a formal RFP will be issued. ..........  This RFI is a request for interested parties that may be able to provide the required spectrum management support to the DSO to describe their capabilities to respond to the requirements described below and provide a rough-order-of-magnitude (ROM) cost for such services. Industry responses will be used by the Government to assess feasibility, technical solutions and acquisition approaches for proceeding on the SMS. ..........  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for information received in responses.  The point of contact (POC) for technical issues is Mr. Stuart Timerman, DSO Program Manager, at  email timermas@ncr.disa.mil.  The POC for contractual issues is Ms. Nancy McClain, Contracting Officer, email mcclainn@ncr.disa.mil. ..........  The SMS project is a method of acquiring technical support services to assist the DSO in fulfilling its mission responsibilities.  The support services will be performed at a government site in northern Virginia and portions of the work may be performed at the contractors facilities.  All contractor personnel must possess a SECRET clearance prior to task assignment. ..........  The objective of  the DSO program is to support the Office of the Assistance Secretary of Defense for Networks and Information Integration (OASD/NII) in the development of policies and plans to ensure that DoD can meet its spectrum needs and to assure spectrum access to our warfighters. Strategic planning and roadmapping of regulatory activities and technology are integral to the development of DoD policies. ..........  Any future solicitation and subsequent contract on this program will be for spectrum management support (SMS) to the DSO. This program encompasses all national and International activities associated with the DoD spectrum Policy and Planning, including the World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC), assessment of impact of commercial technology encroachments into DoD spectrum on DoD operations, study and development of efficient and state-of-the-art technology to increase the efficient and effective use of the electromagnetic spectrum, and to devise strategies to help in furthering DoD’s spectrum management interests both nationally and internationally. ..........  The DISA Defense Spectrum Office provides long-term, comprehensive and strategic planning to assure DoD’s access to spectrum.  The DSO provides and/or coordinates the analytical support, coordinates all joint spectrum management matters, develops DoD spectrum policy that ensures consistent enforcement of spectrum management policy and procedures DoD-wide, and is responsible for the development of efficient spectrum management processes using advanced technology and spectrum management techniques required to ensure DoD global spectrum access in the 21st century.  These responsibilities also include the rectification of both technical and policy issues associated with electromagnetic spectrum and the national and international allocation and assignment of spectrum. ..........  The DSO is primarily comprised of three organizational teams, National, International, and Emerging Technology.  For each team to successfully perform their roles and responsibilities within their respective domains, there are key functions executed to develop the planning, formulate the required product/message/response, and to engage and participate in the appropriate forums.  These functions have been identified within this SOW to be represented within three primary functional areas: Strategic Planning, DoD Outreach and Systems Engineering. ..........  Interested parties responding to this RFI are invited to prepare a white paper and address suggestions to perform the tasks identified and submit them NLT 14 June 2004. All comments and suggestions are welcome. Sources submitting a white paper who are interested in making a maximum 1-hour presentation (open forum) should contact Mr. Stuart Timerman at email timermas@ncr.disa.mil to make arrangements. ..........  
Responses to this RFI are to be sent electronically to both Ms. McClain’s and Mr. Timerman’s email addresses. Email attachments must be virus free, and there must be a positive statement included in the email text certifying the same. ..........  Respondents must include the Company Name, Street Address, City, State, NINE-digit zip code, Point of Contact (POC), POC telephone and facsimile numbers and email address, Company size and Status.  If the Company address includes a post office box, the complete address must also be provided.  Proprietary information should be identified as such.   ..........  Respondents are requested to identify any GSA or GWAC or other usable current government contracting vehicle that may be used in fulfilling the requirements of this program. ..........  Respondents shall classify their company size using NAICS 541330, engineering services - $4,000,000.

8.	JOB DESCRIPTION:

A)  Background:

The USAID Regional Mission for Central Asia (“USAID/CAR” or the “Mission”) is headquartered in Almaty, Kazakhstan, with country offices in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, Tashkent, Uzbekistan, Ashgabat, Turkmenistan, and Dushanbe, Tajikistan.  It is responsible for the development and management of the U.S. Government’s program of assistance that is focused on the growth of small-scale enterprise and trade; building a more open, democratic culture; better management of environmental resources; and improved primary healthcare.  USAID/CAR manages all USAID assistance for the five Central Asian Republics of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Tajikistan.  Central Asia is bordered by Russia, China, Iran and Afghanistan.  Due to its substantial oil and gas reserves, it is a region of considerable geopolitical and strategic interest to the United States.  With a total population of 55 million, and dozens of ethnic groups, the five new nations of the region are emerging from 150 years of Russian domination.  A recent civil war, threats of religious extremism, ethnic rivalries, authoritarian governments, and lack of viable institutions make Central Asia a particularly difficult challenge for USAID.  The region is considered a Foreign Service hardship post – 25% post differential for Tashkent, Uzbekistan.

USAID/CAR is responsible for approximately $110 million of assistance annually, with activities totaling $400 million in the areas of energy and environment, economics and finance, democracy and conflict mitigation, as well as health and education.  The Mission works in partnership with over 70 grantee and contractors throughout the region.  The Tashkent office, led by the Country Representative, includes a team of 2 USDH, 2 USPSCs, and 15 local national technical and administrative support staff.

For two years, USAID has explored the issue of engaging religious leaders and integrating people of influence into our development activities.  These discussions included USAID staff, government and civil society, and a wide range of scholars, Islamic experts and experts on religion, state and society, media and youth in Central Asia.  USAID has created the “Working Group on Religion and Society.”  This interagency, inter-embassy Working Group is represented by staff from USAID/CAR (including each country office) and US Embassy in Central Asia as well as staff from USAID Washington and the State Department. This Working Group seeks to advance USAID’s strategic objectives, and explores the influence of religion, state and society  on USAID activities in enterprise and finance, education and health, democracy and conflict mitigation, as well as energy and water. 

B)  Basic Function:

The successful candidate will serve as the USAID/CAR Mission Religion, State and Society Specialist.   The candidate will implement a broad USAID strategy on religion, state and society in Central Asia, which is in the processing of being finalized.  The RSS Specialist will also serve as the point person for coordinating outreach, developing and implementing program ideas, analysis, and representational functions for religion, state and society issues as they relate to the overall development assistance program.  As such, s/he will provide senior level expert leadership, guidance and advice on how USAID/CAR interacts with religious, state and social actors within its assistance program so as to mitigate the risk of conflict arising from religious extremism.

The RSS Specialist is authorized broad latitude to interact with senior government officials, religious scholars and leaders, local government officials, NGO leaders, as well as other people of influence in the region.  In this role the RSS Specialist will establish contact and develop relationships with a broad array of U.S., international and regional NGOs, think tanks, and moderate religious institutions and explore partnership opportunities on development issues relating to religion, state and society with a focus on mitigating the risk of extremism.  In addition, the RSS Specialist will coordinate with other donors and international organizations, including Muslim outreach programs.

The candidate will help to ensure that USAID efforts are responsive to and integrated within the larger U S Government foreign policy framework.

Finally, the RSS Specialist will serve as the Deputy Team Leader of the Working Group on Religion and Society.  The candidate will facilitate implementation of assistance programs that are developed from the USAID strategy on religion, state and society.  In this role s/he will work with other USAID/CAR strategic objective teams and implementing partners to design and implement new activities.  In consultation with other members of the Working Group on Religion and Society, the RSS Specialist will work to identify, coordinate and implement cross-sector opportunities.  In this role s/he will identify opportunities to engage religious leaders in health, education, energy and water, etc. development programs. The RSS Specialist may also manage small grant projects as opportunities and funding arise to implement small projects within communities that are at risk for extremism.

<RESPDATE>062504
<ARCHDATE>08242004
<CONTACT>Amy Bouren, 586-753-2106
<DESC>This is NOT a pre-solicitation notice pursuant to FAR Part 5.  This notice does not constitute an Invitation for Bid or Request for Proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government. The Program Executive Office-Ground Combat Systems (PEO-GCS) is conducting a market survey to determine the current availability of active protection systems for integration on current ground combat vehicles.  For the purpose of this survey, an active prot ection system is a system that detects and tracks incoming threat projectiles, then uses that threat information to compute a fire control solution.  This fire control solution is used to direct the initiation of a countermeasure.  This countermeasure inte rcepts and destroys the incoming threat, thus protecting the vehicle.  The purpose of the survey is to assist in determining what Non-Developmental Items are currently available.  The Federal Acquisition Regulation defines a non-developmental item as follo ws:   a.   Any previously developed item used exclusively for governmental purposes by a Federal agency, a State or local government, or a foreign government with which the U.S. has a mutual defense cooperation agreement.   b.   Any item described in parag raph a., above, that requires only minor modification to meet the requirements of the procuring agency.   c.   Any item currently being produced that does not meet the requirement of paragraphs a or b, above, solely because the item is not yet in use.    Interested firms should go to the TACOM website at http://contracting.tacom.army.mil/ssn/sources.htm for the questionnaire.  Your responses will assist in finalizing plans for this effort and allow better definition of requirements, thereby providing a mor e clearly written solicitation to industry.   PEO-GCS plans to issue a solicitation for 10 each active protection systems to be installed on Stryker combat vehicles 12 months after contract award.  Information acquired from the market survey will be used to refine requirements for the solicitation.  T he 10 systems will be conditionally released under a limited fielding plan, and a follow-on procurement is possible.  As part of the evaluation process, each offeror will be required to provide at least one fully functional APS bid sample for live fire dem onstration against the RPG-7 class of munitions.  PEO-GCS will conduct a Product Test either at Yuma Proving Ground, Yuma, AZ, or Redstone Technical Test Center, Huntsville, AL, in the September through November 2004 timeframe.  The offeror must also provi de system set-up, functional check-out, system operation and support, and data reduction support for 2 to 3 weeks for their own system.  The test scenarios will be provided at time of solicitation and will be designed to quantify the performance of each sy stem in terms of the probability to protect the vehicle in the following modes of operation:  static, on-the-move, multiple engagements.  There will be no more than 10 bid sample tests, but the test plan is still being developed.  The offeror will be requi red to provide sufficient countermeasure interceptors for the bid sample tests.   The government will not reimburse contractors for any costs incurred as a result of their participation in this survey.  Submit survey documentation preferably by email to the POC below no later than 25 Jun 04.  All survey documentation must be in English.   Proprietary data, if submitted, should be marked as such.  If any portion of the survey response is classified, contact the POC provided below for instructions.  Documentation provided will not be returned.   Questions about this survey should be directed to the POC listed below.  Questions, and the  corresponding answers may be posted to http://contracting.tacom.army.mil/ssn/sources.htm.

<DESC>The USDA, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is issuing this Sources Sought Notice to determine if there are parties who are capable and interested in performing the required services.  All interested parties should respond to this Notice by providing the Contracting Officer with a statement of interest and a description of their capability to perform the statement of work as described in this Notice.  Employees of the USDA-NRCS are not currently performing this service; this will be a new effort to collect and analyze data to better understand the soils and landscape factors that potentially mitigate the leaching and subsurface transport of phosphorus from agricultural fields to surface water.   This project also includes the modification of the Phosphorus Loss Assessment Tool (PLAT) software, developed by North Carolina State University, to implement the results of the data collection and analyses.  

Responses to this Notice must include, as a minimum, the following information:  (1) a statement of interest in performing this work, (2) the size of organization and number of employees who hold college degrees in soils, soil fertility, agricultural engineering, and related fields applicable to this project, (3) experience conducting studies of soils, drainage and hydrology in the Coastal Plain of North Carolina, (4) experience developing and implementing studies to understand the effect of Best Management Practices (BMPs) on agricultural lands, (5) experience with and knowledge of the North Carolina Phosphorus Loss Assessment Tool software, and (6) a description of experience managing projects of similar size, scope, and technical areas.

Background

Phosphorus (P) is an essential crop nutrient, but also a potential water contaminant.  Concerns over phosphorus loss from agricultural lands led to a revised USDA nutrient management policy and standard that require a site-specific assessment of the potential for excessive phosphorus transport to surface water to be included as part of a nutrient management plan.  North Carolina State University led an interagency effort to develop a computer-based Phosphorus Loss Assessment Tool (PLAT) that utilizes scientific information to guide phosphorus management for maximum productivity while minimizing environmental impacts.  PLAT has been incorporated into the NRCS nutrient management standard in the North Carolina Field Office Technical Guide found at www.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/efotg/.  It has subsequently been adopted by the NC Soil and Water Conservation Commission and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources for potential permitting purposes. 

The PLAT development committee and external reviewers identified and confirmed gaps in the supporting science related to the environmental effects of current and projected organic phosphorus application, the mitigating effects of various management practices, and the scientific basis for quantifying the transport of phosphorus from terrestrial to aquatic environments.  This project will address some specific gaps in phosphorus transport science in order to revise PLAT and its supporting databases.

Project Rationale

Phosphorus found in surface waters of the State is contributed by point and non-point phosphorus sources.  Research indicates that agricultural nutrient inputs represent a significant portion of the non-point load.  Soils have a finite ability to absorb phosphorus, with limits largely influenced by specific soil properties such as texture.  Exceeding the capacity of a given soil or site to adsorb phosphorus through over-application of manure phosphorus substantially increases the risk of phosphorus transport to surface and ground waters.  PLAT assigns phosphorus threshold levels for organics, sands, silts and clays, based on soil management groups with similar soil properties.

Leaching is the primary potential transport pathway under study in this project.  When phosphorus leaches below the root zone, intensive subsurface drainage increases potential phosphorus transport to surface water.  Existing research shows that sandy soils subject to a seasonally high water table as found in the North Carolina coastal plain presents increased risk for phosphorus contamination of ground and surface waters.

Unfortunately, little is known about the potential for riparian buffers and soils to mitigate phosphorus losses through subsurface pathways.  Some studies suggest buffers could partially mitigate subsurface losses in the Coastal Plain, but little is known about factors that determine the effectiveness of buffers for subsurface pathways, or how this could be quantitatively incorporated into PLAT.

Project Objectives

The specific objectives of this proposed study are to: (1) validate that the list of NC Coastal Plain soils identified in PLAT as subject to leaching is accurate and modify as needed, (2) quantify the mitigation effects of riparian buffer practices on subsurface phosphorus loss transport under a range of diverse landscape, soil, hydrology, and other site-specific factors, and (3) incorporate the results from the analyses into the NC phosphorus loss assessment procedures.  Satisfying these objectives will allow NRCS and other agencies to (a) better educate producers on the specific processes and factors controlling phosphorus losses via subsurface phosphorus transport from the field to a surface water, (b) update or revise the list of soils that PLAT identifies as likely to leach under high surface phosphorus conditions, and (c) reduce producer workload by identifying site specific conditions that will likely mitigate the transport of subsurface phosphorus from the field to a surface water source.
    
Scope or Work

The contractor agrees to quantify the extent of phosphorus leaching and subsurface transport in soils identified in PLAT with high phosphorus leaching potential and high surface soil test phosphorus levels (> 100 mg P ha-1), quantify the mitigation effects of riparian buffer practices on subsurface phosphorus transport under a range of diverse landscape, soil, hydrology, and other site-specific factors, and update PLAT software and supporting databases to reflect soluble phosphorus transport data obtained in this proposed work. 

Deliverable 1:
	
On 40-50 field sites that meet the criteria (high soil test phosphorus and phosphorus leaching potential), soil samples will be collected along transects from mid-field through the adjacent buffer to the receiving surface water body. Although field size will determine the number of transects monitored per field, approximately 5 in-field soil cores will be collected with at least two located in the buffer. Soil cores (165 cm long) will be collected and subdivided into 15 cm increments (11 samples per core) and analyzed for pH, Mehlich-3 P, Al, and Fe and water-extractable phosphorus to establish relationships between soluble and non-soluble soil phosphorus fractions. Soil texture and organic matter will also be determined.  Completion Date:  August 2005.

Deliverable 2:	

Seasonal water table levels and directional flow will be monitored following well and piezometer installations, respectively, on 4 to 5 sites selected from the 40-50 sites surveyed above. Sampling wells are composed of PVC pipe 120 cm in length and 5 cm in diameter and will be installed to 100 cm depth. Approximately 5 sampling wells will be installed along a transect beginning 5-10 m in-field from the filed-buffer interface through the buffer with at least 2 located in the buffer.  Ground water samples will be collected monthly from wells along each transect. Groundwater pH will be measured immediately upon sampling to minimize measurement error introduced as samples are exposed to CO2.  Samples will be treated with HCl to prevent microbial growth and later filtered and analyzed for soluble phosphorus. Completion Date:  December, 2006.

Deliverable 3:

Data collected from Deliverables 1 and 2 will be analyzed to determine the extent of phosphorus leaching and subsurface phosphorus transport and the influence of vegetative buffers on reducing phosphorus transport to surface waters. Based on the analytical results, PLAT and its supporting databases will be revised to reflect the new phosphorus transport information.  In order to ensure a defensible scientific foundation for PLAT and its use, the results of the project will be published in the scientific literature.  Completion date: December 2006.

<DESC>The USDA, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is issuing this Sources Sought Notice to determine if there are any interested parties who could perform the required services.  All interested parties should respond to this Notice by providing the Contracting Officer with a statement of interest and a description of their capability to perform the statement of work.  Employees of the USDA-NRCS are currently performing this service.  This Notice solicits responses that include, but are not limited to, the following information:  (1) Size of organization and number of employees who hold college degrees in wildlife biology, wildlife management, or forestry, (2) number of employees who are Certified Wildlife Biologists by The Wildlife Society, (3) number of employees who meet the criteria to be certified as USDA Technical Service Providers under the categories “Wildlife and Fisheries” or “Wildlife and Fisheries – Interdisciplinary Biological”, (4) number of employees who hold a Certified Burner designation by the NC Division of Forest Resources, (5) a description of experience managing projects of state-wide scope and complexity, (6) experience developing upland and wetland wildlife habitat management plans on agricultural lands, (7) experience developing technical tools or procedures for wildlife habitat assessments, (8) experience training others in wildlife habitat management assessment and practices, (9) experience with wildlife habitat management in all three physiographic regions of North Carolina, (10) knowledge and experience applying wildlife-related practices using practice standards from Section IV of the NRCS Field Office Technical Guide (nrcs.usda.gov/technical/efotg/), (11) experience conducting effective wildlife conservation outreach and educational programs, and (12) knowledge of USDA Farm Bill cost-share programs and North Carolina’s Cooperative Upland Habitat Restorations and Enhancement (CURE) program.

Background

Under the provisions of Public Law 74-46, the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is assigned responsibility to assist owners and operators with the development and implementation of conservation plans and systems.  The Food Security Act and the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act (Farm Bill) authorize NRCS to utilize Farm Bill conservation program funds to deliver technical and financial assistance for wildlife habitat conservation.

A North Carolina funded effort, the Cooperative Upland Habitat Restorations and Enhancement (CURE) program, has very similar goals of delivering technical and financial assistance for wildlife habitat conservation on private lands.  

Since 2002, CURE and USDA Farm Bill programs have been implemented in a cooperative manner to leverage benefits to wildlife habitat.  This has been accomplished by focusing resources in common areas, sharing wildlife technical assistance from the respective agencies to ensure coordinated delivery of practice assistance, and using the programs’ niches and authorities in a complementary fashion to deliver single integrated wildlife habitat plans for landowners.  This cooperative approach has benefits for the client (a better product and service), the agencies (greater environmental outcomes), and the taxpayer (cost efficiencies).  Since both CURE and the USDA Farm Bill conservation programs share common wildlife objectives, it is the intention of NRCS in North Carolina to continue this cooperative relationship to the greatest extent possible.

Project Objective

The objectives of this project are:

1.  To improve the timeliness of technical assistance for North Carolina land managers who want to receive assistance from the Farm Bill conservation programs and CURE by increasing the level of technical assistance available to support the design, implementation, check-out, and reporting of wildlife-related conservation practices.
2.  To improve the quality of wildlife technical assistance available for North Carolina land managers through the enhancement of wildlife conservation planning technology and outreach tools.
3.  To improve the environmental outcomes from Farm Bill conservation programs by improving the technical quality of wildlife ranking criteria, and evaluating the conservation effects on wildlife habitat and populations.

Implementation of this project will not preclude a Farm Bill program participant from selecting and acquiring technical assistance from any Technical Service Provider certified on the USDA TechReg website (techreg.usda.gov). 
Scope of Work

The contractor is required to:

Deliverable 1: Design wildlife habitat management practices, including the development of detailed practice specifications per NRCS standards (estimate: 6,000 acres per year)

Deliverable 2: Provide technical assistance to support the installation wildlife habitat management practices cost-shared through the Farm Bill.  (Estimate 6,000 acres per year)

Deliverable 3: Provide the technical assistance for checkout, monitoring, and reporting progress of completed wildlife habitat management practices.  This includes verification that practices are applied according to plans and specifications, and reporting progress using NRCS software.

Deliverable 4: Develop wildlife management technical tools and information products e.g., technical notes, practice standards, job sheets for planners, application ranking criteria, etc. (Estimate: 12 per year)

Deliverable 5: Prepare conservation plans for program participants using NRCS planning software.  Includes providing inventory and assessment of wildlife conservation objectives and analysis of natural resource conservation treatment alternatives (Estimate: 30 plans)

Deliverable 6: Prepare and deliver wildlife management training programs for NRCS and other technical service providers. (Estimate 6 programs per year)

Deliverable 7: Prepare and deliver wildlife management outreach products and programs for potential program participants (Estimate: 6 programs per year)

Deliverable 8: Provide assistance in the evaluation of Farm Bill conservation programs effects on wildlife habitat and populations.

Quality Assurance

Technical assistance provided will be spot-checked by USDA-NRCS technical staff to ensure compliance with NRCS planning policies and adherence to Field Office Technical Guide standards (www.nrcs.usda.gov/technical/efotg/).

Deliverable Schedule

Technical assistance will be made available on a continuous basis to support cost-share program applications.  Individual project assignments will be made by NRCS.  The actual extent will vary depending upon program applications within a program application sign-up period.

<SUBJECT>--Workshop for Improvised Explosive Device (IED) Locating Through Explosives Detection
<DESC>The Communications and Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC), Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD) has proposed a four-year, limited funding Science and Technology Objective (STO) program to begin fiscal  year 2005.  The objective of this STO will be to determine the feasibility of locating IED threats along routes in urban environments through explosives detection.  To support this program, NVESD will conduct a workshop to discuss the scientific and engin eering challenges associated with the STO objective.  In particular, NVESD is interested in evaluating the best approaches to quantitatively characterize the chemical signature of typically encountered IED threats.  Additionally, NVESD is interested in det ermining if existing or slightly modifiable sampling and sensing techniques can be effectively applied to the challenge of IED detection. NVESD has tentatively scheduled this one-day workshop for 1 July 2004.  Please consider attending this workshop and co nsult your calendar to determine if this proposed date is available.  NVESD will outline and discuss the currently proposed STO.  This workshop is open to U.S. citizens only.  You are invited to present an unclassified 15-20 minute briefing on the research  that you or your organization conducts that may be relevant to the STO program.  Presentation should focus on scientific and engineering approaches to understanding the source signature, and how the Army might exploit that signature by leveraging existing  sensing and sampling techniques.  Also, presenters should consider potential avenues for collaboration with NVESD.  Due to time constraints, some briefings may not be permitted. Presentation abstracts should be submitted no later than 14 June 2004 and sho uld be sent to the following email address: scott.grossman@nvl.army.mil.

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Federal Air Marshal Service (FAMS) is soliciting for services to provide all commercial aviation flight schedule data (passenger/cargo/charter) provided from the weekly date of delivery for the 12 months forward, including updates on a weekly basis retrievable by FAMS in SSIM 7 file format via ftp.  

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.   This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number applicable to this request for proposal is HSCEAM-04-R-0012.  

In accordance with Clause 52.212-2, “Evaluation-Commerical Items,” offerors are advised that the Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The factors listed below will be used to evaluate offers.

A.	Compatibility with FAMS Software – Contractor’s proposed service shall be compatible with existing FAMS software (i.e. SSIM format).  Contractors will be required to provide test data, if requested by FAMS, to allow FAMS to conduct the necessary testing to ensure compatibility.  Any offering found to be incompatible with FAMS software will be ineligible for award.

B.	Past Performance - Proposals shall provide a minimum of two (2) past performance references for contract services the offeror has provided which are similar in size and scope to this requirement.  Verified/current points of contact shall be provided for each reference to allow the Government to speak with references about the nature and quality of service provided.  When evaluating this factor, the Government will assign greater value to experience which is most directly related to the current requirement and for which customer references provide positive past performance reports which attest to their satisfaction with the offeror’s support.

C.	Completeness of Airline Schedule Coverage - Proposals shall detail the number and title of airlines included to illustrate the completeness of airline schedule coverage. This should include a list of the schedule data that would be provided, as documented in SSIM Chapters and Appendices, such as airline names, flight numbers, departure/arrival cities, dates/times of arrivals/departures, aircraft type, etc. In addition, this documentation shall include the number of flight sectors covered as well as the average number of schedule changes handled per month.  Also included in this section shall be a discussion of resources available for the collection, validation and management of flight schedules and related flight data input.  This discussion shall include the identification of any resources that will be exclusively dedicated to support of the Federal Air Marshall Service.  When evaluating this factor, the Government will assign greater value to proposals exhibiting the greatest breadth of airline schedule coverage as well as the availability of the greatest amount of resources to address the current FAMS requirements (to include exclusively dedicated resources). 

D.	Minimum performance requirements include: 

1.	24x7 operational IT support shall be provided which can be reached either via an Internet address or via a toll free telephone number.
2.	Verbal notification of airline reporting error shall occur within 2 hours of discovery (independent and proactively verify accuracy of schedules based on corporate expertise and knowledge and provide immediate personal notification upon recognition of possible error).  
3.	Proposals shall demonstrate the ability to deliver an ad hoc load should FAMS determine an additional mid cycle load is required.  Pricing for ad hoc loads shall be proposed on a per occurrence basis, separate from other pricing.  
4.	Proposals shall demonstrate the ability to provide a weekly report listing changes for each load (e.g. new airlines).  It is important that weekly reports reflect items such as new aircraft, new airlines, new city pair routes, etc.  
5.	Proposals shall specify a firm delivery date for each load and detail a notification procedure that will be followed if it is anticipated that delivery will be delayed for any reason.  When delays are experienced, FAMS shall be given priority when correcting any delivery delays.

When evaluating this factor, the Government will assign greater value to proposals which not only meet all minimum requirements, but which also exceed the Government’s requirements by offering additional benefits in a cost beneficial manner.


D. Pricing - Offerors shall provide pricing to cover a 12 month period.  Offerors shall assume the first week of service will be that of August 1, 2004.  Pricing shall be broken down by weekly costs based upon 52 weeks of service.  The weekly price shall be itemized to clearly show all components/services that are covered by the weekly price, to include the pricing for each of those components/services.  The itemized list provided shall clearly show how the total weekly price is derived.  Additionally, offerors shall provide a separate price for ad hoc loads which the Government may order on a per occurrence basis.  Finally, the offeror shall also provide pricing for two (2) additional 12-month option periods (2005-2006) in the format just described.

Evaluation factors in descending order of importance are compatibility with FAMS software, past performance, completeness of airline schedule coverage, satisfaction of minimum performance requirements, and price.  Technical evaluation factors (including past performance) when combined are more important than price.  Proposals shall not exceed 15 pages.

(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

"Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

"Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- 

(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 

“Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 

(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002. 

(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair nd timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:
