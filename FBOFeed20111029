<DESC>Overview****************************The Naval Enterprise Networks (NEN)Program Management Office (PMO)PMW-205 has established TechnicalData Research Facilities that will affordIndustry representatives (who possessthe appropriate credentials) with read-only access to NGEN-related technicaldata (TD). These facilities will enableIndustry to view data that is potentiallyrelevant to Next Generation EnterpriseNetwork (NGEN)  acquisition andRequest for Proposal (RFP) processes.This technical data is operational innature and cannot be posted to thecurrent MITRE Internet portal due tosecurity concerns.  The TD is mostlyin raw form. The Government iscontinuing to receive and review theIntellectual Property (IP)but has not completed its review of theinformation being made available. TheGovernment cannot presently attest tothe accuracy or completeness of theinformation being made available.Concept of Operations***************************Reading Rooms within the TechnicalData Research Facilities will provideIndustry with access to incumbentdeveloped NMCI Intellectual Property(IP), as well as Government developedTechnical Data. Members of Industrymust possess an active SECRETSecurity Clearance and execute a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) with thePMW-205 in order to utilize theTechnical Data Research Facilityservices to access the data. TechnicalData, Processes, and Procedures(TDPP) Consultants will provideassistance to Industry representatives,as needed, in the realm of locatinginformation within the data corpus andany associated questions Industryrepresentatives may have. No technicalexploratory or acquisition related areasof inquiry will be broached while in theTechnical Data Research Facilities.Rules of Engagement*****************************Data which is not accessible from theMITRE portal cannot leave the ReadingRooms. For this reason, data cannotbe printed, downloaded, or copied fromthe Reading Rooms. Industryrepresentatives will be able to takenotes but will not be permitted to bringany items into the Reading Rooms.Representatives may also take noteselectronically using a text applicationon the Reading Room machines. TDConsultants will monitor the ReadingRooms for compliance and escortIndustry representatives to and fromthe Reading Rooms. A TD Consultantwill retrieve notes upon exit forinspection to ensure notes do notinclude data that cannot leave theReading Rooms, such as InternetProtocol addresses, schemas, ports, orany other data that would have norelevance to contract bidding, but fullrelevance to malicious attacks on theNMCI network. The TD Consultants willretrieve and scan all originalhandwritten notes and, upon approvalfor release, return to the Industryrepresentative via electronic transfer.Industry representatives must takenotes in plain English.  Any notesresembling code, or that cannot beunderstood, will be redacted prior torelease.Technical Data Research Facility DetailsFacilities are located in Arlington, VAand San Diego, CA. Hours of operationwill be Monday through Friday 0900 1700 respective to the locations timezone. The Technical Data ResearchFacilities will be closed for all FederalHolidays. These services are availablebeginning October 31, 2011 inArlington, VA and on November 10,2011 at the San Diego, CA facility.  Thefollowing supporting documentation isattached to this FEDBIZOPPS (FBO)announcement: 1) Rules ofengagement and 2) Electronicappointment request form.To submit an appointment requestplease complete the attached form andsubmit it toNEN_TDRFAC@falconwood.biz.
