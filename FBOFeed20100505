<DESC>The Metals, Ceramics, &amp; Nondestructive Evaluation Division (AFRL/RXL) is soliciting for Research and Development on next generation thermal protection systems (TPS) materials and processes. The goal is the development of advanced TPS materials and processes and TPS concepts that will enable efficient and effective supersonic and hypersonic aerovehicles.
<p>The Air Force of the future will require revolutionary capabilities to achieve efficient space access and hypersonic flight. Potential applications span the spectrum from expendable missiles to reusable access-to-space vehicles. Vehicles flying at hypersonic velocities in or through the atmosphere will generate extreme heat (1800 deg F to over 2800 deg F) and innovative materials and processing solutions will be required to protect the internal systems from the extreme thermal environment. Advanced materials and concepts which are highly durable, highly capable, highly supportable/maintainable, structurally efficient, extremely light weight, and affordable are sought.</p>
<p>The intent is not to derive precise requirements for a specific vehicle/mission and seek to meet them, since the applications are diverse. Future hypersonic vehicles will require a broad spectrum of materials and concepts to provide the properties required for efficient hot structures. This is a unique opportunity to explore innovative TPS M&amp;P and TPS concepts that can have a revolutionary impact on systems that must survive the extreme environment associated with hypersonic flight.</p>
<p>Address technical questions to: Dr. Paul Jero, AFRL/RXLN, Bldg 655 Rm 184, 2230 10th Street, Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433-7817, Paul.Jero@wpafb.af.mil</p>

<DESC>NASA/ARC intends to extend Contract NNA09DB40C (Ames Research Center LogisticsManagement Services) with Tessada & Associates on a sole-source basis pursuant to 10U.S.C 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source, in support of Ames Research Center's (ARC)Code JS, Logistics and Documentation Services Division. The objective is to extend theperformance period for up to eight months. This extension will allow the necessary time to complete ongoing efforts associated withthe evaluation of proposals received in response to competitive follow-on procurementNNA09281196R, allowing for continuation of services to ensure program continuity andcritical mission support and avoid significant logistic service impacts. The current Contractor provides the following mission critical support services for theNational Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Ames Research Center and MoffettField (MF) locations.  ARC and MF include on-site and off-site Government and  contracttenant organizations, as well as  three areas of military housing (inside MF; outside theMF Main Gate, west of the Moffett Boulevard extension; and on Moffett Boulevard, west ofUS Highway 101). Services are to be obtained by means of a hybrid firm-fixed price, andindefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract.  Services provided by the incumbentcontractor include:  (1) supply and warehouse management; (2) equipment management; (3)mail services; (4) shipping and receiving services; (5) fleet management; (6) refuseservices; (7) janitorial services; and (8) industrial property management. The Contractorprovides all resources, including labor, supervision, tools, equipment, materials,transportation, and management necessary to operate logistics and specialized functionsas described in the Statement of Work (SOW).The extension will increase the current contract value and extend the period ofperformance for a period of up to eight months, from July 1, 2010, through February 28,2011. The current contractor, Tessada & Associates, Inc., is considered the onlycontractor that can meet ARCs needs given the short period of performance for theextension. Award to another source at the same time that the evaluation of contractorproposals received in support of the competitive recompetition is in process would resultin substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recoveredthrough competition of the extension and would not allow for a sufficient phase-inperiod, thereby affecting the continuity of services and causing unacceptable delays infulfilling ARCs requirements.This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by theGovernment not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis,based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Notwithstanding this stated intent, interested organizations may submit theircapabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified pointof contact IN WRITING to the identified point of contact not later than 1 PM PDT on May14, 2010. Such communication of capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely forthe purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitivebasis. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.

CDC has purchased vaccines under a separate supply contract or delivery order, and the Contractor shall provide storage of the same at Contractor furnished sites. Justification for other than full and open competition is considered to be in the government's best interest due to the fact that Merck is the only company which has exclusive full capabilities to store and rotate the vaccines that Merck manufactures. Note 22 applies herein. The statutory authority permitting other-than-full-and-open competition is 41 U.S.C., 253(c)(1): FAR 6.302-1.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for project management, engineering and installation/construction work for power systems and power system ancillary equipment and structures.  The engineering services include: site surveys, coordination studies, and design specifications and drawings.  The installation and construction work includes but is not limited to: Engine Generators (EG), fuel tanks, fuel systems, Uninterruptible Power Systems (UPS), power panels, Heating Ventilation Air Conditioning (HVAC), equipment shelters, remote maintenance monitoring systems, and miscellaneous electrical work.  The general equipment size range, intended for installation, is: engine generators from 20 kW to 1,000 kW; UPS from 15 kVA up to 1,100 kVA.
Work performed under this requirement will be replacement, enhancement and/or maintenance of existing power systems.  The majority of work will be replacement of power systems in existing facilities.  The facility size, and corresponding power service capacity, ranges from small sites with a 20 kW Engine Generator (EG) to consolidated critical power facilities with multiple 1 MW EGs.  The vast majority of sites have EGs in the small 100 kW to medium 500 kW range.  Approximately twenty-nine (29) sites can be classified as large critical power facilities.  The work at large critical power sites is more complex and involves a higher risk to the Air Traffic Control system than work performed at the smaller facilities.  
Seven (7) Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity type contracts, with fixed-priced pricing arrangements, have been awarded to provide these services.  The contracts include a base year and four 1-year renewal options.  These options may or may not be exercised, at the sole discretion of the FAA.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Sole Source - Only One Responsible Source
The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Richland Operations Office (RL) intends to award a sole source contract under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, to the Office of the Washington State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) located at: 
Department of Archaeology & Historic PreservationSuite 106 1063 South Capitol WayOlympia WA 98501Phone: 360-586-3065Website: http://www.dahp.wa.gov/
The requirement is for cultural resource reviews and documentation services for the Hanford Site (located in Benton County, Washington). 
The DOE-RL is responsible for ensuring that the federal legal requirements pursuant to the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) are met when any cultural and historic resource at Hanford is affected. This law and its implementing regulations: 1) authorizes DOE-RL to expend funds for the purposes activities carried out in pursuant to this act and, 2) requires DOE-RL to consult with the SHPO on cultural resource reviews and documentation. 
Depending on the complexity of the project, cultural resource documentation that the SHPO reviews could include:  monitoring plans, data recovery reports, review of archaeological site forms, National Register Determinations of Eligibility, research designs, mitigation action plans, memorandum of agreements, programmatic agreement, and post review discovery reports.  
As a result of the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act of 2009 (ARRA), there has been a significant increase in projects at Hanford requiring SHPO cultural resource reviews.  The number of reviews has gone from a few per year to potentially dozens and is expected to continue to increase throughout 2011.  The SHPO office staff is currently unable to timely review this large increase in cultural resource documentation which will negatively impact project schedules and costs.  Only a qualified archaeologist meeting Department of Interior standards in the SHPO office can review these documents.
The SHPO administers the national historic preservation program for the State of Washington, reviews National Register of Historic Places nominations, maintains data on historic properties that have been identified but not yet nominated, and consults with federal agencies pursuant to the National Historic Preservation Act. The SHPO is appointed by the Governor and the appointed officer is the only designee who can perform this review. Therefore, DOE-RL is required by NHPA to work with the SHPO office to fulfill the requirements. 
The contract with the State of Washington will provide for an archaeologist meeting the Department of Interior standards who is detailed to the Washington SHPO office, and is tasked with working solely on DOE-RL projects. With this contract in place DOE-RL can ensure that the State of Washington has the required personnel to review the cultural resource documentation under the NHPA and, therefore, is not delaying cleanup at Hanford.
This acquisition is classified under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 921190, Public Property Management Services, Government. Small business size standards are not established for this sector. Establishments in the Public Administration Sector are Federal, state, and local government agencies which administer and oversee government programs and activities that are not performed by private establishments. 
More information on SBA size standards is available at: http://www.sba.gov/services/contractingopportunities/sizestandardstopics/index.html.
This notice is not a request for proposals and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract. As a result of this notice, the Government may award a sole source contract for a period of up to two years. 
The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."

<DESC>Background: The Retrieval Group (Information Access Division/Information Technology Laboratory) at the United States Department of Commerce (DOC), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) runs large-scale evaluations of information retrieval systems such as document retrieval, question answering, and summarization systems.
<p>The work of the NIST Information Technology Laboratory, Information Access Division Retrieval Group includes a set of projects whose purpose is to foster the development of computer systems that are able to analyze and manipulate the information content of artifacts originally constructed for consumption by humans.</p>
<p>One of the artifacts of interest includes web logs or "blogs" as they are commonly called. Blogs are a recent internet phenomenon. Blogs are similar to a traditional web site, except that they consist of short articles, called "blog posts," which are usually ordered by date. Blogs allow any person to easily produce a personal diary or opinion column and publish it online. The goal of the Blog phase of the Blog/Entity task is to create a test collection for blogs, so that researchers can better understand how people search blogs and thus design better search technology for this new media.</p>
<p>Another artifact of interest is an "Entity." An entity is defined as a person, product, or organization with a homepage. A homepage is the canonical place for that entity on the World Wide Web. This is as opposed to a Wikipedia page about the entity, or a fan site devoted to the entity, or other possible locations which might be considered good web sites for the entity. NIST's homepage is http://www.nist.gov. There is also a Wikipedia entry for NIST, but that's not NIST's homepage. The goal of the "Entity" phase of the Blog/Entity task in this PWS is to encourage the development of search systems that can find the homepages of relevant people, products, or organizations in response to complex queries.</p>
<p>The end result of this project is to use the information gathered from the Contractor personnel to modify, test or improve exiting search engines and also to develop new state of the art search engines. Also, this information is shared with universities around the USA that are developing new ways to search for data on the web. This project is part of the NIST mission of "promoting U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement in science, standards, and technology in ways that enhance economic security and improve our quality of life". With this project NIST seeks to advance the existing technology and to help create new technologies that help to improve our way of life.</p>
<p>Scope of this Acquisition: This presolicitation notice is for a noncommercial services acquisition for work in the area of Blog/Entity research in an effort to improve existing information retrieval systems. NIST intends to solicit this acquisition under the procedures set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (which are for acquisitions valued up to $100,000). NIST also intends to compete this acquisition as a Total Small Business Set Aside under the NAICS code 541990, with a small business size standard of $7.0 million. The period of performance is anticipated to be less than one year. The Government intends to utilize the labor-hour contract type for these services because it is not possible for the Government to estimate accurately the extent or duration of the work or to anticipate costs with a reasonable degree of confidence.</p>
<p>Availability of Solicitation: NIST intends to post the solicitation on www.fbo.gov on or about 16 days after this notice is posted. Quotations will be due no later than approximately 17 days after the solicitation is posted on www.fbo.gov.</p>
<p>Requirement for Active Registration in CCR: Each Offeror must have an active registration at www.ccr.gov to be eligible to receive an award under this acquisition.<br /><br />All questions regarding this acquisition shall be directed by email to the primary point of contact: Keith Bubar at keith.bubar@nist.gov.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command intends to award a Delivery Order under Basic Ordering Agreement N00019-09-G-0005 on a sole source basis with Lockheed Martin Systems Integration.  This effort is for Common Data Link (CDL) Hawklink production support, first article inspection test (FAIT) support, and ECPs to incorporate Harris/BAE and L3 Communications CDL Hawklink into the MH-60R aircraft.  This effort also includes an option to validate the ECP on the MH-60R aircraft with first production articles.

This action is being awarded on a sole source basis to Lockheed Martin Systems Integration, in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 “Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements;” because they are the only qualified source which possesses the detailed knowledge of the MH-60 mission systems design to allow them to perform these integration efforts in a timely and cost effective manner. Questions concerning subcontracting should be directed to John Hess at (607) 751-3670.  See numbered note 22.

The intent of this project is to replace the existing HVAC system at building 900.  Work includes but is not limited to the following; Remove the chiller system and two air-handling units and their associated equipment, split systems, and the roof top units (RTU) for comfort air and their associated equipment.  Provide new chiller system with variable air volume (VAV) and Direct Digital Control (DDC) for all comfort air areas, except computer test bed and SCIF areas.
The building has three (3) different HVAC areas; the personnel areas; the computer test bed areas; and the SCIF area(s).  The HVAC in computer test bed and SCIF areas are still relatively new and sufficient.  The 100-ton water chiller provides chilled water for the HVAC in the personnel areas was installed in 1979. It's very old and insufficient. The Government has attempted to resolve the problem by installing many roof top units and split systems.  The systems, however, are prone to HVAC failures.

<DESC>Introduction:FAR Part 10 requires the Government to conduct market research before developing new solicitation requirements for an acquisition.  Results of market research are used to determine whether qualified sources exist and to obtain industry comments and information on future procurements.
One of the ways the Government conducts market research is to hold an Industry Day.  Industry Day provides a brief description of the Government's intentions regarding program/acquisition approach and identifies key events in the acquisition program schedule.
Industry Day:The NAVSEA Contracts Directorate (NAVSEA 02) on behalf of Program Executive Office Submarines (PEO-SUB), Undersea Weapons Program Office (PMS 404), will be hosting an Industry Day to discuss the High Altitude Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) Weapon Capability (HAAWC) Program.  
The HAAWC Industry Day is scheduled to be held at the Naval Undersea Warfare Center (NUWC) Division Newport, Newport, RI on 16 June 2010 from 12:30 pm to 4:00 pm (local time).  To initiate registration, email your name(s) and email address by 26 May 2010 at 4:30 PM EDT to james.c.ferguson1@navy.mil to receive the formal registration instructions, visit request/security clearance requirements, and agenda.  If you do not receive that information within seven days of your email, please re-send your request.  Additional details will be included in the formal registration instructions.
During Industry Day there will be NO opportunities for questions or discussions between individual industry representatives and Government technical Program Office representatives.  The Government will, however, provide index cards to industry partners in attendance to document questions that arise during the conference. The Government will collect aLL index cards prior to the conclusion of Industry Day. The Government will respond to questions no later than 09 July 2010, via a follow-up FedBizOpps announcement.
Draft RFP:NAVSEA 02 contemplates the issuance of a draft RFP for the potential HAAWC requirement.  It is expected that the draft RFP will be issued prior to Industry Day.  A formal announcement of the issuance of the draft RFP will be provided in a subsequent FedBizOpps announcement.

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command intends to modify, on a sole-source basis, existing contract N00024-07-C-2302 to Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding (NGSB), P.O. Box 149, Pascagoula, MS 39568 for continuing the accomplishment of DDG 51 Class Follow Yard Services. DDG 51 Class Follow Yard Services will provide necessary Follow Yard engineering, technical, liaison, shipyard engineering team, turnkey, crew indoctrination, design tool/design standardization, material procurement and production support for DDG 51 Class follow ship configuration, new technology, data and logistics management, lessons learned analysis, acceptance trials, post delivery test and trials, post shakedown availability planning, systems safety program support, program closeout and fleet turnover and other technical and engineering analyses and studies for the purpose of supporting DDG 51 Class follow ship construction and test and trials.   As the follow-yard ship designer and builder, NGSB is the only firm capable of providing timely and effective follow-yard services to support DDG 51 Class follow-yard construction. NGSB has the requisite familiarity and knowledge of DDG 51 Class configurations as well as a detailed understanding of the construction techniques and practices used to build these ships.  The resultant contract modification will increase manhours over an exercised option for FY10 and an unexercised option for FY11.  Firms interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding directly.  
The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to negotiate under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 13.501 (a), on a sole source basis with I/S Management Strategies, Ltd 4942 N. Hollywood Ave Whitefish Bay, WI for consulting services for our mainframe management effort.&nbsp; The LPA Capacity and Software Usage Analysis (LCS) software tool is proprietary and only available from I/S Management Strategies Ltd.&nbsp; SSA currently operates six (6) IBM z/Series mainframes at the National Computer Center (NCC) in Baltimore, MD including zAAP processors.&nbsp; The Agency runs mainframe software products from hundreds of vendors on 29LPARS.&nbsp; The Agency requires services from a vendor that is independent from the software products running on its mainframe environment to continue software pricing model assessments.&nbsp; The contractor shall assist SSA in further studies of alternate software pricing structures in the Agency's mainframe z/OS operating environment.&nbsp; The contractor will assist the Agency in building a comprehensive analysis of software products on the Agency's z/Series mainframes.&nbsp; This analysis will allow SSA to formulate expert knowledge of mainframe software to assist the Agency in planning and execution of software procurement activities.&nbsp; The outcome of the expanded study will allow SSA to leverage new knowledge of software pricing models that allows for savings to the Government.&nbsp; To date, I/S Management Strategies, is the only company identified by SSA that has the capability for providing independent software pricing model assessments and assistance in determining the best licensing structures for mainframe software products.&nbsp; I/S Management provides interrelated educational, technical, and technological planning services in the areas of performance management and capacity, tactical, and strategic planning; they are purportedly the only source available with an existing tool (LPAR Capacity and Software Usage Analysis (LCS) Software) that can assist in planning for, implementing, monitoring, and leveraging software Workload License Charges (WLC). &nbsp;No other tool is believed to be available that is capable of combining information about SSA's licensed software products, analysis of utilization data, and prices to provide near real-time estimates of software charges.
<p><br />SSA has previously conducted extensive market research and published multiple notices to identify alternative sources of supply for these services.&nbsp; This research has demonstrated to the SSA that I/S Management Strategies is the only organization uniquely qualified to implement all the tasks required by SSA.&nbsp; SSA's previous market research/public notices can be found at: <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/spg/SSA/DCFIAM/OAG/Reference-Number-SSA-RFI-031507/listing.html">https://www.fbo.gov/spg/SSA/DCFIAM/OAG/Reference-Number-SSA-RFI-031507/listing.html</a>,<br /><a href="https://www.fbo.gov/spg/SSA/DCFIAM/OAG/Reference-Number-SSA-NOI-07-1131/listing.html">https://www.fbo.gov/spg/SSA/DCFIAM/OAG/Reference-Number-SSA-NOI-07-1131/listing.html</a>, <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/spg/SSA/DCFIAM/OAG/SSA-NOI-08-1159/listing.html">https://www.fbo.gov/spg/SSA/DCFIAM/OAG/SSA-NOI-08-1159/listing.html</a>,<br />and <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/spg/SSA/DCFIAM/OAG/3318-09-1296/listing.html">https://www.fbo.gov/spg/SSA/DCFIAM/OAG/3318-09-1296/listing.html</a>.</p>
<p>SSA previously awarded three one-year purchase orders to I/S Management Strategies for these services.&nbsp; This follow-on agreement will have a period of performance of five years (base year plus four option years). &nbsp;Again, this is a notice of intent to negotiate on a sole source basis with I/S Management Strategies for these follow-on services and not a request for competitive proposals.</p>
<p>Any responsible firm that feels it has the capability to provide this requirement and has similar capabilities and resources as I/S Management Strategies may respond in writing no later than May 11, 2010 with capability statements and information describing in full detail their capabilities to accomplish SSA's objective. &nbsp;Additionally, respondents should cite specific examples of their experience in providing independent software pricing model assessments and assistance in determining the best licensing structures for mainframe software products. &nbsp;Interested parties that feel they can provide these services may respond by submitting their capability statement by email to <a href="mailto:Nicole.D.Taylor@ssa.gov">Nicole.D.Taylor@ssa.gov</a> .&nbsp; All responses shall reference Notice Number SSA-NOI-10-1119.&nbsp; Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. &nbsp;A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.&nbsp; If no responses are received by the cutoff date above, the SSA will proceed with sole source negotiations with I/S Management Strategies Ltd.&nbsp; Again, all questions and submissions in response to this notice must be submitted in writing to the e-mail address listed above. &nbsp;Verbal responses will not be considered.&nbsp; Telephone calls regarding this matter will not be accepted, nor will they be returned.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) is a multi-agency research and development program that was established by Congress in 1991.  As described in Title 10, U.S.C., Sections 2901-2904, the major focus of SERDP is to address environmental matters of concern to the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy through support for basic and applied research and development of technologies that can enhance the capabilities of the departments to meet their environmental obligations.    The SERDP supports environmental research and development activities in government, industry, and academic laboratories in the areas of environmental restoration, sustainable infrastructure, weapons systems and platforms and munitions management.  Details on requirements for SERDP projects can be found on the SERDP web site (www.serdp.org)<BR><BR>The Environmental Security Technology Certification Program (ESTCP) is a DoD demonstration/validation program for environmental technology.  The DoD established ESTCP in fiscal year 1995.  The ESTCP demonstrates and validates the most promising innovative environmental technologies that target DoDs most urgent environmental needs and are projected to pay back the investment through cost savings and improved efficiencies.   The program provides support to government, industry, and academic institutions to conduct demonstrations and validations of environmental technologies in the areas of environmental restoration, sustainable infrastructure, weapons systems and platforms and munitions management.  ESTCP demonstrations are conducted under operational field conditions at DoD facilities. Details on requirements for ESTCP projects can be found on the ESTCP web site (www.estcp.org)<BR><BR>The SERDP and ESTCP are separate and distinct programs.  Each is funded under its own program element.  They are managed out of a joint office.  The joint management of these two programs increases coordination, enhances the transition of technologies, and reduces DoD management overhead.  The efficient management of these two programs by one office requires a single unified support contract.<BR><BR>The SERDP and ESTCP require program support to meet their statutory requirements and ensure that projects funded are of the highest quality, executed efficiently and evaluated according to SERDP and ESTCP guidelines which are documented in the annual solicitations at www.serdp.org and www.estcp.org. This includes support for evaluation and rating of proposals.  <BR><BR><BR>The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) intends to negotiate a contract on a competitive basis, set-aside for small business, for SERDP and ESTCP Technical and Program Support.  The contract will be a Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity type Contract for a period of one (1) year with four (4) one (1) year options.   Anticipated release date of the RFP will be on or about 20 May 2010.  A proposal will be due 30 days from the release date unless an amendment is issued to extend.  All responsible small business sources may submit an offer, which will be considered by this agency.  It is the Offerors responsiblitity to watch FedBizOpps for the solicitation (W912HQ-10-R-0003).  The Contracting Office will not be notifying offerors when the solicitation is released.<BR><BR>

11. Description:

In April 2005, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) published Policy Letter 05-01, Developing and Managing the Acquisition Workforce, which requires the Federal Acquisition Institute (FAI) to develop, and the Chief Acquisition Officers Council (CAOC) to approve, a certification program for contracting professionals in civilian agencies that reflects common standards. The goal of the certification program is to standardize the education, training, and experience requirements for contracting professionals, which will improve workforce competencies and increase career opportunities.

The Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 and the subsequent Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) Policy Letter 05-01 (found at www.fai.gov ) require the heads of Federal agencies, through their Senior Procurement Executive, to define the education, training and experience necessary for career progression within the acquisition workforce job functions identified in table 1. This includes mandatory coursework and on-the-job training.  Under the current law, individuals in the occupational series GS-1102 and those possessing a contracting officer's warrant, regardless of their occupational series, are required to meet certain baseline training and education requirements based on their grade.  
VA is one of the largest consumers of commercially-acquired goods and services in the Federal Government.  In addition to the 1102 series, VA has expanded the definition of "acquisition workforce" to include: See Table 1.  The VAAA's mission is to develop competency-based training programs for the VA's acquisition workforce to ensure acquisition excellence within the agency.  See Attachment 1. 

Table 1- Acquisition Workforce Job Functions
Job Functions
Contract Specialists  					Construction and Facilities Management
Contracting Officer Technical Representative	Information Technology Specialists
Program Managers					Systems Engineers		
Logistics Management Specialists
 
For the past two years, the VA has been instructing classes for the acquisition workforce. Based on lessons learned, they are seeking contractors to provide support of the evaluation of the training program using the Kirkpatrick Evaluation Model and ROI. (These services will not be used to identify individuals or individual's data measure or job performance.) See Table 2.

The vendor will perform follow-up evaluations at 3, 6, and 9 month intervals.  The vendor will make contact with 100% of the students and supervisors.  The 3 month interval requires a minimum 50% response from the students and supervisors.  The 6 month interval requires a minimum 40% response from the students and supervisors.  The 9 month interval requires 25% response from the students and supervisors.  Deliverables: The vendor will deliver monthly reports that include an analysis of the data.

1e. ROI- Measure: Return on Investment- The vender will identify the proper procedures and measures and calculate the ROI for the VAAA and each of the 4 schools. Deliverables and delivery schedule will be stipulated in individual task orders.
1f.

<a href="mailto:Carlos.Leon@va.gov">Contracting Officer</a>
<DESC>Questions and Answers to VA-258-10-RP-0068

1.	Do the consultants need to have worked in the VA System? What specific areas of accreditation/standards do the consultants need to have expertise in i.e. behavioral health care, ambulatory care, etc.? Is there a preference on the number of teams performing the Mock Joint Commission Survey?
Answer:
	Surveyors need to be familiar with VA so they should have conducted mock surveys or taught JC standards in VA, conducted actual surveys in VA, or have actually worked in VA. No real areas of expertise beyond what is stipulated in SOW. One team only (seeking consistent team membership with recognition that due to unforeseen circumstances, a member might be unavailable for a given survey and have to be replaced).


2.	 What are the minimum credentials and requirements needed of the consultant who is to perform the mock of each type of facility? i.e. can a specialist in JCAHO hospital accreditation survey other types of organizations, e.g. long term care, etc.?
Answer: 
Members collectively must have experience surveying all JC programs noted in SOW.


3.	   Clarification is needed on the description of a Blind Rehabilitation program since this is not indicated as  one of the accreditation programs under the Joint Commission.
Answer:  
	Blind rehab has been removed from SOW.


4.	  Have the dates of the surveys for each facility been negotiated?
Answer: 
	Dates have not been set, as stated in item #9; these are to be negotiated with each facility and must be completed before December 31, 2010.

5.	    Does the Doctorally prepared nurse consultant need to have worked in the VA system in addition to have developed educational programs at the Joint Commission and collegiate level?
Answer:
	Doctorate not required....doctorate preferred as noted in SOW.  The answer is Yes.

6.	    Will any consideration be made for a consultant who has areas of expertise as both a Joint Commission surveyor and consultant without having worked in the VA System?
Answer:
	Mock survey experience in VA, actual JC survey experience in VA, JC standards education/training experience in VA or actual employment in VA required.

7.	    Do the members need to possess certification as Joint Commission surveyors; this is not a minimum requirement for Joint Commission surveyors (i.e. surveyors employed by the Joint Commission), but instead is a voluntary for each surveyor?
Answer:
	Certification not required.

8.	  We understand the "life safety" portion of a Mock Survey to relate to the Joint Commission Continuous Readiness Program for the Environment of Care.  This portion of a Mock Survey, in our experience, involves surveyors who possess engineering and/or related technical backgrounds and hold certifications such as Certified Healthcare Safety Professional (CHSP) and/or Certified Healthcare Facilities Manager (CHFM), etc.  Please specify whether the Government's proposed 3-person team is expected to complete the Environment of Care portion of the Mock Survey and, if the answer is in the affirmative, what credentials are required to be held by the individual completing the life safety portion of the Mock Survey.
Answer:
Three member team comprised of a combination of medical doctor, a Master's prepared (doctorally prepared nurse preferred) registered nurse, and a Master's prepared registered nurse with combined experience in Hospital, Life Safety.

9.	Please confirm whether each mock survey team member is required to have worked as a surveyor for the Joint Commission.  Will the Government accept quality assurance (including infection prevention and control) experience in hospital settings? 
Answer:
	Surveyors need to be familiar with VA; they should have conducted mock surveys or taught JC standards in VA, conducted actual surveys in VA, or have actually worked in VA.

10.	Does the Government intend the 3 person survey team to also survey for speciality areas such as behavioral and long term health?  Our experience is that 3 person teams are augmented - often with a fourth team member - for a portion of the mock survey to perform speciality types of surveys. 
Answer:
	Yes, 3 person team as Specific requirement #1. 

11.	Our experience is that surveys tend to go beyond 3 days if additional areas such as behavioral and long term health are surveyed?  Will the Government consider proposals that go beyond the 3 day time period indicated in the Amended Solicitation?  Does the Government have an expectation for survey length for each facility described in the Amended Solicitation, i.e., 3 days at Facility A, 5 days at Facility B, 4 days at Facility C?
Answer:
	?, NO, 3 days at each facility as stated in the Statement of work.

12.	Is there an incumbent contractor?
Answer:
	NO.

<DESC>Sources Sought<br />Systems Engineering Support of the iNET Program
<p>Schedule:<br />Closing Date: 10 May 2010</p>
<p>Scope:<br />The Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC) is seeking information from the public on engineering support of the iNET (Integrated Network Enhanced Telemetry) Program. This is not a request for Quote. The Air Force Flight Test Center at Edwards AFB, CA is seeking vendors capable of providing the following engineering support of the iNET (Integrated Network Enhanced Telemetry) Program, as detailed in the attached Statement of work/Performance work statement.</p>
<p><br />RFI Purpose and Limitations:</p>
<p>The Government's intention is to better understand the current state-of-the-art for iNet program support and to determine the best acquisition approach. Industry feedback is vitally important and the Government will be receptive to any and all ideas received from industry. Please note that this synopsis is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute a solicitation for competitive bids/proposals and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. However, all interested parties who believe they can meet the requirements are invited to submit in writing complete information describing their ability to provide the engineering support of the iNET (Integrated Network Enhanced Telemetry) Program as detailed in the attached SOW.</p>
<p>Background Information:</p>
<p>The iNET Program has been actively performing systems engineering and system design of the Telemetry Network System (TmNS). In conjunction with this, standards have been developed and continue to be matured to ensure commonality and interoperability of systems developed by different vendors.</p>
<p>LinQuest Communications has been involved in every aspect of the Program. They have provided support at the very top during system level engineering to very detailed design during the standards work.</p>
<p>At the system level, LinQuest has supported the iNET Program's Systems Engineering team by providing detailed functional analysis and functional decompositions into hardware. In order to perform this work, a complete understanding of the entire TmNS is required. The TmNS spans the Test Article, Ground Station and, most importantly, the wireless connection between the two networks. Many factors come into play during system design with the entire trade space too large to mention here. But, to give examples, end-user requirements, system security requirements, network access and hand-over, network throughput, environment, etc. all must be understood, examined, and traded against all other requirements in order to perform the System-level design. These requirements, for the most part, are specific to aeronautical flight test and not related to commercial systems.</p>
<p>The detailed standards work involved many trade studies such as modulation techniques, power amplifier structures, burst synchronization, error correction coding, encryption algorithms, key management, packet framing, connection control, queue management, quality of service, etc. Each of these topics required a subject matter expert to perform the trade study and present the outcome to the working group. These trade studies, coupled with vendor and user interaction, form the basis of the Radio Access Network standard, the standard that now defines the wireless connection between test articles and ground stations which currently stands at over 230 pages.</p>
<p>The system knowledge and detailed designs and trade studies mentioned above was acquired and accomplished over several years of analysis, iNET team interaction, and vendor meetings. This deep understanding and "corporate knowledge" can only be achieved through interaction with all parties involved including the Test Ranges, end-users, and Programmatic personnel over a long period of time.</p>
<p>With the information above and in accordance with the attached statement of work, we need to know the following:</p>
<p>1. How long would it take the interested company to get up to speed and be able support this new project?<br />2. What cost, if any, would be associated with getting up to speed, and would it be expected for the government to pay for that effort?</p>
<p>The information received as a result of this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Air Force not to open the requirement to open competition, based on response to this sources sought synopsis, is solely within the discretion of the Air Force. The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this RFI.</p>
<p>Proprietary information is not being solicited; however, if it is submitted, it should be appropriately marked. It may include attachments that consist of pre-printed commercial brochures or sales literature. Electronic submissions are strongly encouraged. All information provided will be protected as Procurement Sensitive per Federal Acquisition Regulation 3.104. Electronic responses shall be in MS Word or Adobe PDF format. Information must be received no later than 5:00PM Pacific Time on 10 May 2010. For technical questions regarding this notice, contact Pat Feeley at (661) 277-1608 or patrick.feeley @edwards.af.mil. For contracting questions, contact Nathan Hansing at (661) 277-8317 or nathan.hansing@edwards.af.mil.</p>

<DESC>The Natick Soldier Research Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC) is seeking technical information for a new, simultaneous DSC-TGA (Differential Scanning Calorimeter-Thermal Gravimetric Analyzer).  The simultaneous DSC-TGA is required to include the following at a minimum:  (i) capability of measuring both reliable weight change (in the TGA), and true differential heat flow (in the DSC) on the same sample from ambient to 1500oC.   (ii) This equipment should have a horizontal dual beam design that support precise TGA and DSC measurements without thermal drift and baseline correction.  The horizontal dual (2) balance mechanism (one for the sample and one for the reference), and a horizontal purge gas system with digital mass flow control and integral gas switching capability, are needed to minimize weight drift due to thermal expansion and the buoyancy effect of the purge gas.   (iii) The TGA sensitivity of 0.1 micrograms and the DSC sensitivity of 4 microwatts are needed for detection of weak transitions in small samples of polymeric materials.

<DESC>Subject to FAR Clause 52.215-3, entitled "Solicitation for Information of Planning Purpose," this announcement constitutes a Sources Sought for information and planning purposes.  FISC Norfolk's intent of this announcement is to identify qualified and experienced sources for a contract vehicle that will provide IT services for the Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) Navy Enterprise Network (ONE-NET), and to accomplish migration of business support and command and control (C2) systems from legacy networks to ONE-NET.  ONE-NET provides 24/7/365 NIPRNet/SIPRNet access, network connectivity and security, electronic mail and Blackberry, file and print services, voice over SIPRNet (VOSIP), web access, and desktop support via Theater Network Operations and Security Centers (TNOSCs) and the Local Network Support Centers (LNSCs) located at Fleet concentration areas throughout OCONUS.  
This 24/7/365 capability includes the functional areas of Network and Systems Operations (Fault, Configuration, Accounting, Performance, and Security (FCAPS) Management, Network Defense (ND), Common Applications Support, and Transport Services).  Additional support extends into Service Desk, Field Services, Information Assurance, Network Technical Support, IT Service Management, Enterprise Management Support, Voice Over Internet & Telephone Support, and Theater Application Support. Through Program Executive Office (PEO) for Enterprise Information Systems (EIS), ONE-NET infrastructure is installed at fourteen (14) overseas fleet concentration areas, owned and operated by NAVY CYBERFOR. 
The ONE-NET infrastructure is comprised of three (3) TNOSCs located at Yokosuka (Japan), Naples (Italy), and Manama (Bahrain). TNOSCs function as the single point of contact for the network operations and the focal point for decisions for regional customers. These decisions involve service priorities, restoration priorities, and other enterprise-wide operational issues within their region. Service is primarily focused on Network and Systems Operations, Service Desk, Network Technical Support and Information Assurance.  The Yokosuka TNOSC services the Far East Theater and the Naples and Bahrain TNOSCs service the Europe and Middle East theaters respectively.  These three theaters are under the operational control of Naval Computer Telecommunications Area Master Station (NCTAMS) Pacific (PAC) and NCTAMS Atlantic (LANT).
LNSCs are extensions of a TNOSC where physical presence is required.  Service at this level shall be primarily hardware-related and limited to device and cable plant maintenance, component replacement, and providing the on-site touch labor to respond to service requests and system problems that cannot be resolved by the TNOSC remotely.  LNSC supports life-cycle maintenance activities and ONE-NET service level objectives by providing touch-labor associated with the refresh and warranty repair of devices attached to the ONE-NET network.
A chart of the TNOSCS, LNSCs and all applicable site locations with anticipated seat counts is available as Attachment A.
The operations model is anticipated to be two-fold.  NCTAMSPAC is expected to be a Government Owned/Contractor Operated model where the contractor provides operational support.  NCTAMSLANT is anticipated to be a Government Owned/Government Operated where the contractor provides support to augment the Government personnel performing operational support.
This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and no contract will be awarded from this announcement. It is not to be construed in any way as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information submitted in response.   
NAICS CodeThe NAICS Code for this requirement is 541513, Computer Facilities Management Services, and the Size Standard is $25.0M.
Anticipated ContractThe proposed contract is anticipated to be a multiple award, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract. The contract will utilize cost plus fixed fee (CPFF) / firm fixed price (FFP) pricing. The Government anticipates the award of competed task orders in response to the Government's requirement in accordance with FAR 16.505
Period of Performance The period of performance for this requirement will be a 12 month base year and four 12 month option periods.  This contract is estimated to commence on 03 January 2011. 
Contractor must provide a capabilities statement detailing their technical expertise in the functional areas and displaying their ability to provide the necessary personnel at all sites. The capabilities statement must be presented in sufficient detail for the Government to determine that your company possesses the necessary functional area expertise and experience to compete for this acquisition. Contractors response shall also include the following information and can be submitted in your own format: Size of company, i.e., 8(a), WOSB, SB, Veteran, all others, number of employees, revenue for the past 3 years, relevant past performance on same/similar work dating back 5 years and your company's capability to perform the type of work. Standard company brochures will not be reviewed. Submissions are not to exceed six (6) typewritten pages in no less than 12 font. Also, please indicate if your company can be a prime contractor for this effort or, if not, whether your company can be a subcontractor.

<CONTACT>Clara Rudisill, Realty Specialist, Phone 202.551.8662, Fax 703.333.6171, Email rudisillc@sec.gov
<DESC>Requirement:  OFFICE AND RELATED SPACE – EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST.  

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) currently occupies office and related space at 801 Brickell Avenue, Miami Fl under a lease that is expiring July 31, 2012.  The SEC is seeking to acquire equivalent and additional space upon lease expiration, consisting of approximately 74,000 rentable square feet which must yield approximately 63,500 ANSI/BOMA usable square feet (usf) of Class A office and related space for use by the SEC for personnel, furnishings, equipment, and two (2) reserved parking spaces.   The SEC prefers that the offered space be located within the same elevator bank, a maximum of four (4) contiguous floors and with a minimum floor plate of 18,000 rentable square feet.  Contiguous floors with larger floor plates and fewer vertical shafts (e.g., elevator banks) will be more favorably evaluated unless the floor plate is so large as to limit daylighting in interior spaces.  Floor plates must have potential for efficient space layout. Parking available for visitors and employees must meet or exceed local code.  The SEC will consider relevant relocation/duplication costs (e.g., value of existing improvements, telecommunications, etc.) in its evaluation of subsequent offers received. 


Unique Requirements:  By occupancy, the leased space and building shall meet the requirements of the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards (ABAAS), seismic, Federal Fire Safety Act of 1992, and local fire and life safety codes.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS.  No proposals are being requested or accepted with this synopsis.  The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to determine the availability of qualified Contractors.  The primary North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code applicable to this requirement is 541712, Research Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology).  The Small Business Size Standard is 500 Employees.<BR><BR>The Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP)  is seeking  businesses to provide services to further the understanding of long-term risk reduction from activated carbon treatment of sediment.  Aligned with this purpose, the goal of this project is to assess the ecological recovery of a contaminated site after in situ treatment. The main objectives of this strategy are to incorporate rapid, inexpensive assessment tools to measure contaminant concentrations in the sediment pore water, to use a biodynamic modeling approach to predict contaminant burden at the base of the food web, and to develop a general model to predict the ecological characteristics of recovery. The three objectives are tied together in that biodynamic modeling predictions of contaminant uptake, which depend on contaminant pore water concentrations measured with the rapid assessment tools, are employed in the general ecosystem recovery model. Using this comprehensive strategy, researchers will assess the ecological recovery at Hunters Point Naval Shipyard Parcel F (San Francisco Bay, California) after in situ remediation by activated carbon amendment.  It has been determined that a follow up study is needed to assess the long-term risk reduction for hydrophobic organic contaminants in sediment amended with activated carbon.<BR><BR>This market survey is for information and planning purposes only, and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP).  It is not to be construed as a commitment by the U.S. Government.  No award will be made as a result of this market survey.  All information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government.  The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any private sector input as a result of this market survey.  The Government is not obligated to notify respondents of the results of this survey.   Interested Offerors shall respond to this Sources Sought Synopsis no later than 1:00 pm, 20 May 2010.

This is for information purpose only. No solicitation will be awarded against this RFI VA-248-10-RI-0376.
This is for the VA Medical Center, Research & Development, Gainesville, Florida.

Scope of work for proposed RR&D Development project titled: Self-Management Intervention for Veterans with Upper Limb Amputation.

Specific Aim 1 (Phase 1 Development Project):  To develop a Computer/Internet-Based 3-Module Self-Management Intervention using Operation enduring freedom/operation Iraqui Freedom (OFF/OIF) upper limb (UL) amputee actors.

The intervention will consist of three modules that provide knowledge about UL amputation and prostheses followed by interactive experiences that will, as examples, address choosing a new prostheses, learning use of the new prosthesis, emotional aspects of living with an amputation community integration opportunities for UL amputees.  Creation of the intervention will be a Department of Defense (DOD)-VA Collaboration.

This project will develop three web-based modules will be developed under the lead of PI Winkler and CO-PI Yancosek with input from expert consultees.

Module I:  UL Amputation Overview:  The overview will present information on the history, incidence, and prevalence of UL AMPUTATION, THE LEVELS OF ul AMPUTATION (FIGURE 8), the stages of rehabilitation (pre-Operative; surgery and reconstruction. Pre-prosthetic, prosthetic prescription and fabrication,  prosthetic training, community integration, vocational rehabilitation, follow-up), and overview of UL prosthetic devices.

Module II:  Living With Amputation:  The content presented in module II will be procedural knowledge, providing opportunities for problem-solving, the first self-management skill.  Problem solving in the self-management context refers to identifying the problem and generating possible solutions including suggestions from peers. Module II will use some text and hyperlinks', but predominantly graphic and video. Task will be presented. Veterans will learn how to do them by watching peers perform the tasks.  Audio will include frustrations and emotions associated with performing the tasks.

Module III:  Interactive Case Studies:  the content presented in Module II will also be procedural knowledge. In Module III, participants increase their proficiency by continued practice with case studies that provide feedback. Module III will provide with an opportunity to apply facts and procedures learned in Modules I and II to developing a lifestyle that accommodates their desired level of function. 

In Module III, Service member/Veteran Actors and Veteran Participants will have access to the "Virtual Ability" Community at second life housed on the Amputee Virtual Environment Support Space (AVESS) Site. The project is funded by Telemedicine and Advance Technology Research Center (TATRC) of the US Army Medical Research and Material Command (USAMRMC), Contract "W81xWH-09-P-0731".

Work associated with developing module content above.

Capture raw video and audio:  We will hire eight active duty and civilian (including Veterans) amputee actors to create the video,  that will be used to support module content.

1.	 We are seeking a contractee who has proven experience working with OEF/OIF UL amputee population who will work with the PI to identify and coordinate the hiring of UL amputee actors. The actors can have active duty or veteran status.

2.	 The contractee will then coordinate with the PI, the capture of raw audio and video. Actors will be issued handy cams for one -two months to spontaneously capture aspects of their daily lives that may be helpful to other veterans with UL Amputations. The video will be down loaded to a memory stick and mailed to the contractee.

Timeline:  Video capture from 8 actors will begin month two and will be complete by the end of month 12.

3.	The Contractee under the guidance of the PI, will edit the video into approximately 1-minute clips and select still graphics from video. For the three modules described earlier.  We anticipate 8-16 hours of video x 8 actors = 120-160 hours of video.

4.	 The contractee will compress the Digital Code as needed and finalize video for playback and stop points.

Work associated with insertion content into an E-learning format.

Develop Electronic (E-Learning Format: E-Learning is the process of designing the electronic format so that the presentation takes advantage of the  technology by displaying photos and animations that help clarify instructional points.  In addition playing movie clips create interactive scenes that require a response from the user to demonstrate they understand.


5.	The contratee will have documented expertise with the articulate software.  Articulate software will be used to create three E-Learning modules (Previously Described) integrating content from PI Winkler and edited video and stills.

Timeline:  Creation of E-Learning Modules will begin Month 2 and will be complete by the end of the month 21.

The three modules will be beta tested and necessary edits made.

Timeline:  Creation of E-learning modules will begin month 18 and will be complete by end of month 30.

Build Website.

A Website with an index page describing the project will be built.  The index page will link to a links page and a research page.

<DESC>I. Description
<p>The Air Armament Center, Capabilities Integration Directorate (AAC/XR) is interested in creating an industry outreach program in order to foster Government/Industry relationships and to create future partnerships which will foster technological advancements. The industry outreach program will consist of on-site contractor visits made by an AAC/XR leadership team not to exceed 6 people. The team will visit the eastern region of the U.S. from 14 - 18 June 2010, the central region of the U.S. from 19 - 23 July 2010, and the western region of the U.S. from 23 - 27 August 2010. This team will present a 5-12 slide briefing describing the function of AAC/XR at a top level, and the abilities of AAC/XR with a specific focus on 5 topics: Air Dominance, Directed Energy, Advanced Concepts, Long Range Strike, and Hard and Deeply Buried Targets. Contractors are encouraged to present information to AAC/XR; areas of consideration can range from SBIR projects, IRAD plans/options, International Cooperative Efforts, or anything else in those areas. The ultimate goal of this partnership will be to develop the most cutting edge technologies so that they have practical applications for commercialization and future DoD efforts to support the warfighter. To this end, AAC/XR will be interested in sharing information about innovative capabilities and technologies currently in development.</p>
<p>II. Technical Approach</p>
<p>Those parties interested in the industry outreach program must submit a statement of capability (SOC), not to exceed 3 pages, to AAC/XR at the following e-mail address: aac.xr.workflow@eglin.af.mil in accordance with the dates identified in the table below:</p>
<p><strong>Region&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meeting Dates&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;SOC Submission Dates<br /></strong><br />Eastern&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 14 - 18 June&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 24 - 28 May<br />Central&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19 - 23 July&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;28 June - 2 July<br />Western&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 23 - 27 August&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 - 6 August</p>
<p>The SOC should include a synopsis of past and current research efforts (for DoD work please provide Contract or Reference #). The SOC should also include any pertinent information regarding the Government's development of travel arrangements for the AAC/XR leadership team, including, but not limited to, a facility address, directions and a point of contact (POC). Any participants who wish to discuss classified information during AAC/XR's visit may do so during AAC/XR's visit at any desired level, but the intent of such disclosure, including which level of classification the participant intends to discuss must be included in the SOC. For any security related inquiries contact Christine Wicker, AAC/XR, 850-883-4925. AAC/XR will review all SOCs to determine if a visit to the facility will benefit AAC/XR's industry outreach program. Once that determination is made a representative from AAC/XR will contact the POC identified in the SOC to schedule a four hour visit to the contractor's facility. AAC/XR or the identified contracting representatives are not obligated to contact any contractors if a visit is not deemed beneficial to the industry outreach program.</p>
<p>The industry outreach program is being developed for the sole purpose of information exchange. No money, goods, or services shall be exchanged in any way during this program. The Government will arrange and provide for its own travel, and the participant should not incur any expenses as a result of AAC/XR's visit. Participants are reminded that issuance of this notice does not obligate the Government to pay any SOC preparation costs, or to award any contract. Furthermore the Government is not obligated to enter into any partnerships in any way during the industry outreach program. Contact DeAnna Morales, AAC/XR at (850)883.5907 or at Deanna.morales@eglin.af.mil with any technical questions.</p>

This item is the Power Hawk Assembly, consisting of the following, 1) Power Hawk Unit (P/N: Powerhawk-001), 2) (P/N:G-Man Hitch, GMANF6AUNIVERSAL) 3) (P/N: Power Hawk Kit B2455-7502) 4) P/N: Power Hawk Case, Case 024)  The government intends to award a single, firm fixed price, GSA delivery order IAW Far 8.402(f), whereby the ordering activity may add items not on the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) to an FSS delivery order. This  Power Hawk assembly is designed specifically for use with the Remotec Andros F6 robot already owned by the North Dakota Air National Guard. The basis for restricting competition is that Remotec Inc. is currently the sole manufacturer of this assembly.

It will be awarded on an Unrestricted basis. The Justification and Approval (J&A) citing the authority of FAR 6.302-1, will be uploaded shortly for public inspection. THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE OFFERS and a solicitation will not be issued; however, any firm that believes it can meet the requirements may give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 10 days from the date of the publication of this synopsis. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the requirements listed. Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion for the Government. If no responses are received, the Government will proceed with the sole source to the manufacturer Remotec Inc. Responses are due by 14 May 2010, 4:30 p.m. (CST).

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.501(a) with Johnsons Controls, Inc. (JCI) of Milwaukee, Wisconsin to repair/overhaul four (4) 3,500 ton York refrigeration units (RU) at NIST’s Gaithersburg, Maryland campus.

The RUs are highly specialized chiller equipment with refrigerant fluid under high pressure and complex, source-specific electronic controls and sensors.  
This repair/overhaul involves internal work of the RUs and includes the disassembly, diagnostic assessment, repair, and refurbishment of components beyond routine maintenance.  As such, the work is required to be performed by a certified JCI technical trained by the manufacturer, and any parts necessary for these service repair/overhauls are required to be provided by the equipment manufacturer.  Failure to adhere to the manufacturer’s requirements will void all future warranty provisions, incur significant financial liability (and safety risk) for the Government and potentially impact the mission of the agency as a result of using unauthorized repairs.  As a result the only source to perform the required repairs/overhaul is JCI certified technicians and those technicians are employed by JCI.
  
This work falls under the SBA NAICS of Subsector 238 – Specialty Trade Contractors, specifically 238220, Plumbing, Heating, and Air-Conditioning Contractors. 

The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within seven (7) days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under statutory authority 41 USC 253 ( c) (1) with Kibart, Inc. of Towson, Maryland to provide post construction award services (PCAS) for Phases 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the “Replace Site Steam and Select Chilled Water Distribution Piping” project currently being performed at the NIST Gaithersburg, Maryland campus.

As required by the Business Occupations and Professions Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland, the original engineering documents for the project were signed, sealed, and dated by a professional engineer employed by Kibart.   

To maintain a single source of liability any corrections, revisions, or additions required to be made to the project documents should be made by the professional engineer, or his representative within the company, who originally signed and sealed the documents.  There is a significant cost associated with this factor. Therefore, these PCAS services are considered a logical follow-on and Kibart the only reasonable source for this service.  

This work falls under the SBA NAICS of Subsector 541330 – Engineering Services. 

The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.

<RESPDATE>051010
<ARCHDATE>05112010
<CONTACT>Sharon L. Walker, Phone (816)426-7470, Email sharon.walker@noaa.gov
<DESC>This publication serves as notice of intent to conduct a commercial fisherman census in the U.S. Virgin Islands for the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Services, Eastern Region Acquisition Division. The government intends to award a contract on a sole source basis to Barbara Kojis in St. Thomas, Virgin Islands. The government intends to issue fixed price contracts under the authority of FAR Part 13, 106-1(b) to conduct a commercial fisherman census in the U.S. Virgin Island. The performance period is from date of award through 18 consecutive months. <br />Justification: Dr. Barbara Kojis has a unique combination of scientific and practical fisheries management experience, particularly in the area of small-scale fisheries. Dr. Kojis was the director of the U.S. Virgin Islands' Division of Fish and Wildlife and member of the Caribbean Fishery Management Council for 10 years. As part of her director and council duties, she was not only responsible for developing and directing programs to foster the sustainable management of recreational and commercial fisheries but also became uniquely acquainted with small-scale fishermen management issues around the U.S. Caribbean.
<p>Dr. Kojis has been a principal investigator for a number research projects dealing with commercial fisheries management issues in the U.S. Virgin Islands. For example, she was part of team that examined the impact of trap fishing on coral reefs. More recently, Dr. Kojis was responsible for developing U.S.V.I.'s draft response fishery management plan to deal with lionfish.</p>
<p>Dr. Kojis was responsible for developing the first commercial fishermen census of the U.S. Virgin Islands (see, Kojis, 2004). Contracting with Dr. Kojis would ensure that the methodology and content of the survey is maintained which will make it easier to compare changes over time. Furthermore, as former direction and council member, Dr. Kojis has a unique understanding of the dynamics of the islands, which will provide unique insight into the evolution of the industry over the last seven years.</p>
<p>Dr. Kojis' work has been published in a variety of academic journals and books including the Environmental Biology of Fishes, Bulletin of Marine Science, Caribbean Journal of Science, Coral reef restoration handbook, Revista de Biologia Tropical, among others.<br />Dr. Kojis has considerable experience developing and executing surveys in the U.S. Virgin Islands. As noted above, she has developed and ran the first commercial fishermen census in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Maintaining this continuity would ensure that the final product is compatible with earlier efforts and would allow NOAA to have a common form across the U.S. Caribbean (i.e., Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands) when characterizing the industry and analyzing regulatory impacts.</p>
<p>Dr. Kojis is familiar with U.S. Virgin Islands fisheries. As former director of the local fisheries agency, she is well known by the industry. In addition, her survey team is made up of many former, local Fish and Wildlife staff, which is also very familiar with the local fishing industry in both St. Thomas and St. Croix. This familiarity and hands on experience with the industry, should reduce cost of the project since the team knows well the industry participants and there is no need for special accommodations (e.g., hotels). These are important considerations the government will take into account when conducting a voluntary data collection.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive responses. However, all responses received within&nbsp;five days after date of publication of this notice may be considered by the government. Responses can be faxed to Sharon Walker at (816) 274-6983 or sent via email to shaorn.walker@noaa.gov. A determination by the government not to compete the acquisitions based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Description: The towpath was constructed on fill sections behind a masonry retaining wall or on an intermittent rock ledge at the base of a steep bluff. The historic stone masonry retaining wall that supports the towpath has been badly damaged by repeated floods and has not been repaired adequately since the canal ceased operations in 1924. Reconstruction will reestablish the towpath along a 4000-ft stretch of historic walls. An elevated walkway will be constructed along portions of the towpath adjacent to the rock bluffs. In other areas, the historic wall will be stabilized and the towpath reconstructed.

Under authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), the value of the contract is expected to be under $17,000.
This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, the Government shall consider all responses received prior to the close date of this announcement.  Written responses to this notice shall contain sufficient documentation to establish bonafide capability to fulfill the requirement.  A solicitation is not available.  Please email contract specialist, Emma Lynch with responses or questions regarding this requirement at emma_lynch@nps.gov
The National Park Service (NPS), Olympic National Park requirement:
OVERVIEW
The Natural Sounds Program requires additional sound level meters and associated parts for ongoing field data collection to support Air Tour Management Plans. Larson Davis meters have been used by the NSP to collect tens of thousands of hours of data. NPS Natural Sounds Program staff, CESU staff, and staff at various National Park units have been trained to use this equipment. The Natural Sounds Program has developed several pieces of software dedicated to this product.
Larson Davis is the only producer of sound level meters that meets Natural Sounds Program needs for data logging capacity, low power consumption, and ease of use. The cost of retraining staff, modifying associated equipment and power systems, and rewriting the supporting software would significantly delay upcoming field work, and add enormous costs to the monitoring effort.
AUTHORITY
41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulations Subpart 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies of services will satisfy agency requirements;  and Subpart 13.106-1(b)(1) provides for soliciting from a single source if the procurement does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold and the contracting officer determines that only one source is reasonably available.. 
JUSTIFICATION
1. Agency Identification: Department of the Interior, National Park Service, Air Resources Division, Natural Sounds Program
2.  Nature or Description of Action Being Approved:  Purchase of two (2) Larson Davis 831 Sound Level Meters and required cables.
3.  Description of Supplies or Services Required:   The project requires ANSI Type 1 sound level meters than can: a.     collect calibrated, one second 1/3 octave band data,b.     log this information in a machine readable and easily transferable format,c.     integrate with current NPS remote data collection software.
4.  Demonstration that proposed contractor's unique qualifications or nature of the acquisition requires the use of the authority cited:  Larson Davis meters have been extensively used by the NPS Natural Sounds Program as well as several park units.  In addition, extensive software packages have been written that are specific to the data produced by Larson Davis sound level meters.  
5.  Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practical, including whether a CBD notice was or will be publicized as required by subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies:  FAR subpart 5.202(a)(13)(i) "amount not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold."
6.  Contracting Officer's Determination That Cost is Fair and Reasonable:  The cost for two units is under $17,000, and will be purchased directly from the manufacturer. NPS is getting a discount on this equipment that distributors cannot offer.
7.  Description of market survey conducted: A survey was conducted of all of the equipment available at the 2009 Internoise conference in Ottawa. No other manufacturer can meet our needs. Cirrus CR-831B sound level meter cannot provide Leq analysis at one second intervals (The NPS and FAA standard), as well as having poor external data logging features. The Quest Technologies SProDLX Type 1 is not capable of measurements as sensitive as the Larson Davis model, and it requires three times as much power to operate. The Brel & Kjr 2250 and 2270 sound level meters have comparable features but unacceptably high power consumption. Low power consumption is a critical feature for long term deployments at remote sites. Larson Davis provides the needed features of data logging capacity, low power consumption, and ease of use.
8.  Other facts supporting use of other than full and open competition: Cost of retraining employees and revising NPS support software.

Rationale for non-competitive contract action - The Roofing Inspection Consultant has extensive knowledge about this historic building and this project to replace the copper roofing, having assisted/advised NPS during the project design phase and on-site mock-up.  He is uniquely qualified to assist NPS with inspection services during the construction phase, having served as the roofing and waterproofing quality assurance specialist for the Denver Service Center, the central project office/technical center of NPS.  He is skilled in working with the NPS  construction/contracting processes and roofing industry processes and standards.  This project involves specialized roofing and waterproofing details, materials and systems.  The consultant's design development history, mock-up review, start-up problem solving, and in-depth knowledge of the project's construction (in progress), are part of his project understanding that make this consultant invaluable to this project.  Finally, his extensive experience on high-visibility historic properties will be an asset to his judgment and decision making for this nationally significant cultural resource.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY; THEREFORE FAR 5.203 DOES NOT APPLY.  THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR UNDER W91278-08-C-0028.<BR>The Mobile District Corps of Engineers intends to issue a modification to contract number W91278-08-C-0028, a competitively awarded Cost-Reimbursable Plus Award-Fee (CPAF) contract for the Operation and Maintenance of Government-Owned Facilities and Equipment, Alabama River Lakes Project, awarded to Eagle Aviation Services and Technology, Inc., 1801 Robert Fulton Drive STE 450, Reston, Virginia.  Utilizing American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds, the modification will increase the level of effort originally contracted for in order to continue the upgrading of Gunter Hill Campground, specifically to renovate the Antioch (Loop A), and access roads to both Antioch and Catoma (Loop B) loops.  This work will include the re-routing and addition of roads, renovation of campsite spurs including addition of concrete parking pads, and upgrading of water and electric utility distribution systems.  The work will include removing some existing asphalt paving and outdated campsite furniture and border timbers.  The work is within the scope of the original contract technical provisions which includes maintaining and repairing buildings, structures, facilities, and their mechanical, electrical, plumbing, sewage and water systems in all of the recreation areas.  Contract clauses required for projects involving Recovery Act funds have been incorporated into the existing contract. <BR><BR>The existing contract must be used for the following reasons:  1) The contractor is already responsible for the complete inspection, maintenance, and repair of this recreation area.  2)  The scheduling, coordination, quality assurance and/or subcontracting for the work to be performed are within the scope of the original contract technical provisions and must be accomplished under the terms of the existing contract. The incumbent contractor not only has the management, technical, and administrative skills to efficiently and effectively accomplish this work at a reasonable cost, but also the advantage of the flexibility to readily adjust to any unforeseen obstacles encountered during installation.  3)  This contract enables repairs to begin immediately without a detailed scope of work and thus minimizes the time the facilities are closed and the impact on public access to camping and recreation during the busiest season of the year.    <BR><BR>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using funds appropriated by the Act.  Acquisitions must comply with FAR, and to the maximum extent practicable, be awarded under competitive procedures as fixed-price (FP) contracts.  The Mobile District intends to use the current CPAF contract to meet it requirements.  Though not a FP contract, it was awarded competitively as a small business set aside.  The contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed.  Furthermore, the existing Operation and Maintenance contractor has experienced personnel that are already on site and ready to perform the work.  Accordingly, it is deemed to be in the best interest of the government and in compliance with the goals of the Recovery Act to use the existing Operation and Maintenance contract to accomplish the requirements listed above.<BR>

THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR(S) UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER(S): R&D Maintenance Services, Inc., W91278-06-C-0038<br><br>The Mobile District Corps of Engineers intends to issue a modification using Recovery Act funding to contract number W91278-08-C-0013, a competitively awarded Cost-Reimbursable Plus Award-Fee contract for the Operation and Maintenance of Government-Owned Facilities and Equipment, Allatoona Lake and Dam Project, Cartersville, Georgia, awarded to R&D Maintenance Services, Inc., P.O. Box 815 Hennessey, OK.   This modification will include removal of the existing damaged fence from its current location and the rerouting and placement of a new fence.  The new fence will run from the toe of the abutment to 3 feet beyond the rivers edge. The total length of the new fence will be approximately two hundred and fifty feet long depending on final alignment. In addition to replacing the fence the contractor will be responsible for removing all trees and underbrush from the upstream side and 10 feet downstream of the new fence. This work will be accomplished on the downstream side of the Allatoona Dam on the north bank of the Etowah River.   <BR><BR>This existing contract must be used because the contractor is responsible for the complete inspection, maintenance, and repair of all project buildings and structures, as well as all equipment and vehicles to support the effort. The contractor has not only the management, technical, and administrative skills to efficiently and effectively accomplish this work at a reasonable cost, but also, the advantage of the flexibility to readily adjust to any unforeseen obstacles encountered during installation.  <BR> <BR>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using funds appropriated by the Act.  Acquisitions must comply with FAR, and to the maximum extent practicable, be awarded under competitive procedures as fixed-price (FP) contracts.  The Mobile District intends to use the current CPAF contract to meet it requirements.  Though not a FP contract, it was awarded competitively as a small business set aside.  The contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed.  Furthermore, the existing Operation and Maintenance contractor has experienced personnel that are already on site and ready to perform the work.  Accordingly, it is deemed to be in the best interest of the government and in compliance with the goals of the Recovery Act to use the existing Operation and Maintenance contract to accomplish the requirements listed above. <BR>

<p>The NAICS Code is 611512; size standard $25.5</p>
<p>IAW 10 U.S.C. 2304c(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 - Only One Responsible Source and no Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements. A Firm Fixed Priced Award will be made in accordance with the following Description of Supplies:</p>
<p><br />DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES: Contractor shall provide training to approximately six (6) Pakistan Officers between July-Oct 2010 at contractor locations in CONUS in accordance with (IAW) objectives to provide necessary skills to PAF aircrew personnel to support their flying mission.

<p>JUSTIFICATION</p>
<p>The Pakistan Government purchased two specially modified King Air 350 aircraft under FMS case G2-D-SAH and pilot training is being purchased through AETC CONS/LGCI. The Pakistan Air Force would like all pilots to receive the same training, to include a level "D" full motion simulator equipped with the Proline 21 avionics package. An extensive internet search resulted in three (3) companies that currently operate a level "D" full motion King Air 350 simulator: FlyRight Inc. located in Concord, North Carolina, CAE in Dallas, Texas, and FlightSafety in Wichita, Kansas. Only FlightSafety's Level "D" simulator is equipped with the Proline 21 avionics package.</p>

<p><br />CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT</p>

<p><br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors. The government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest. In determining the most advantageous offer to the government, the government shall consider the following three factors: technical, past performance, and price. Technical, past performance, and price, when combined, are all equal.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

<p>NOTICE OF CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS (OCT 2005)<br />Compliance with Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) and Federal Information Processing Standard Publication 201 (FIPS 201)1 entitled "Personal Identification Verification (PIV) for Federal Employees and Contractors," Phase I.<br />1. Long-Term Contractor Personnel:<br />In order to be compliant with HSPD-12/PIV I, the following investigative requirements must be met for each new long-term2 contractor employee whose background investigation (BI) process begins on or after October 27, 2005:<br />a. Contractor Personnel must present two forms of identification in original form prior to badge issuance (acceptable documents are listed in Form I-9, OMB No. 1615-0047, " Employment Eligibility Verification, " and at least one document must be a valid State or Federal government-issued picture ID); <br />b. Contractor Personnel must appear in person at least once before a DOJ official who is responsible for checking the identification documents. This identity proofing must be completed sometime during the clearance process but prior to badge issuance and must be documented by the DOJ official;<br />c. Contractor Personnel must undergo a BI commensurate with the designated risk level associated with the duties of each position. Outlined below are the minimum BI requirements for each risk level:<br />&bull; High Risk - Background Investigation (5 year scope)<br />&bull; Moderate Risk - Limited Background Investigation (LBI) or Minimum Background Investigation (MBI)<br />&bull; Low Risk - National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) investigation<br />d. The pre-appointment BI waiver requirements for all position sensitivity levels are a:<br />1) Favorable review of the security questionnaire form;<br />2) Favorable fingerprint results;<br />3) Favorable credit report, if required;3<br />4) Waiver request memorandum, including both the Office of Personnel Management schedule date and position sensitivity/risk level; and<br />5) Favorable review of the National Agency Check (NAC)4 portion of the applicable BI that is determined by position sensitivity/risk level.<br />A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements.<br />If the NAC is not received within five days of OPM ' s scheduling date, the badge can be issued based on a favorable review of the Security Questionnaire and the Federal Bureau of Investigation Criminal History Check (i.e., fingerprint check results).<br />e. Badge re-validation will occur once the investigation is completed and favorably adjudicated. If the BI results so justify, badges issued under these procedures will be suspended or revoked.<br />2. Short-Term Contractor Personnel:<br />It is the policy of the DOJ that short-term contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or fewer are subject to the identity proofing requirements listed in items 1a. and 1b. above. The pre-appointment waiver requirements for short-term contractors are:<br />a. Favorable review of the security questionnaire form;<br />b. Favorable fingerprint results;<br />c. Favorable credit report, if required;5 and<br />d. Waiver request memorandum indicating both the position sensitivity/risk level and the duration of the appointment. The commensurate BI does not need to be initiated. A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements and the badge will expire six months from the date of issuance. This process can only be used once for a short-term contractor in a twelve month period. This will ensure that any consecutive short-term appointments are subject to the full PIV-I identity proofing process. For example, if a contractor employee requires daily access for a three or four-week period, this contractor would be cleared according to the above short-term requirements. However, if a second request is submitted for the same contractor employee within a twelve-month period for the purpose of extending the initial contract or for employment under a totally different contract for another three or four-week period, this contractor would now be considered "long-term" and must be cleared according to the long-term requirements as stated in this interim policy.<br />3. Intermittent Contractors:<br />An exception to the above-mentioned short-term requirements would be intermittent contractors.<br />a. For purposes of this policy, "intermittent" is defined as those contractor employees needing access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for a maximum of one day per week, regardless of the duration of the required intermittent access. For example, the water delivery contractor that delivers water one time each week and is working on a one-year contract.<br />b. Contractors requiring intermittent access should follow the Department's escort policy. Please reference the August 11, 2004, and January 29, 2001, Department Security Officer policy memoranda that conveys the requirements for contractor facility escorted access.<br />c. Due to extenuating circumstances, if a component requests unescorted access or DOJ IT system access for an intermittent contractor, the same pre-employment background investigation waiver requirements that apply to short-term contractors are required.<br />1 FIPS 201 is available at:<br />www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips201/FIPS-201-022505.pdf<br />2 Under HSPD-12, long-term contractors are contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or longer. The PIV-I identity proofing process, including initiation and adjudication of the required background investigation, is required for all new long-term contractors regardless of whether it is the current practice to issue a badge. The second phase of HSPD-12 implementation (PIV-II) requires badge issuance to all affected long-term contractors.<br />3 For contractors in position sensitivity/risk levels above level 1, a favorable review of a credit check is required as part of the pre-appointment waiver package.<br />4 In order to avoid a delay in the hiring process, components should request an Advance NAC Report when initiating investigations to OPM. Per OPM ' s instructions, to obtain an Advance NAC Report, a Code " 3" must be placed in block " B " of the " Agency Use Only " section of the investigative form. This report is available for all case types.<br />5 For contractors in position sensitivity/risk levels above level 1, a favorable review of a credit check is required as part of the pre-appointment waiver package.<br />d. If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the contractor will only be issued a daily badge. The daily badge will be issued upon entrance into a DOJ facility or space and must be returned upon exiting the same facility or space.<br />e. If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the approval will not exceed one year. If the intermittent contractor requires unescorted access beyond one year, the contractor will need to be re-approved each year.<br />4. An individual transferring from another department or agency shall not be re-adjudicated provided the individual has a current (within the last five years), favorably adjudicated BI meeting HSPD-12 and DOJ's BI requirements.<br />5. The DOJ's current escorted contractor policy remains unchanged by this acquisition notice.</p>

Award will be based on the lowest evaluated price of quotations meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for the non-cost factors.    

Factor – 1 Contractor Past Performance  –   This factor shall be evaluated for acceptability only on a pass/fail basis and shall not be rated. An offeror who has been found to have a satisfactory past performance history will then have its proposal evaluated for the lowest price. 
 
a.	 Past Performance – This standard is based upon the offeror’s ability to substantiate credible examples of past performance associated with their commercial and/or Government offerings, including delivery, schedule compliance, product quality and overall customer satisfaction. Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances; it will not be based upon absolute standards of acceptable performance.

b.	Options - The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option (s).

 
c.	A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer’s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer, whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.


 d.	Although the Government intends to award a firm-fixed price contract as a result of this solicitation, the Government reserves the right to reject any and all quotations received and not award any item from this solicitation.

Also, Line Item #14 is amended to say, each work area must be divided by a privacy screen with sound absorbing properties that has a depth of 48" and a height at least 60".

<DESC>RECOVERY ACTION: This notice is provided for information purposes only.  This opportunity is available only to the Contractors that have an existing Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract. The Department of Energy, Golden Field Office has a requirement from within the Department to conduct Energy Savings Performance Contract site reviews to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions as well as guaranteed savings.   The work funded by this Request for Quote is within the scope of the existing Project Facilitator Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contracts which were awarded to multiple small business set-aside contractors, after full and open competition.  This procurement is for a Task Order to be issued as a competitive award with the competition limited to the existing Project Facilitator Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contracts.  The award will be on a time and materials basis as the uncertainties involved in performance do not permit co sts to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price method.  The award will have a nine (9) month base period, with no options, for a total of nine months.  The Project Facilitator is in support of the Department of Energy's Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) and includes consultations and facilitation of energy savings projects.

<CONTACT>Matthew D. Parlett, Contracting Officer, Phone 6105574237, Fax 6105574224, Email mparlett@fs.fed.us
<DESC>The USDA Forest Service intends to award one firm, fixed price contract for the purchase of a quantity of seven (7) each of Belfort Instrument’s AEPG1000 Precipitation Gauge and Accessories on a brand name or equal basis. Complete details of the items required can be found in the attached solicitation document AG-3604-S-10-0024. 

This procurement is on a brand name or equal basis. The Forest Service presently supports intensive climate and carbon cycle research at more than a dozen sites where ecological and meteorological measurements are taken from towers extending above the forest canopy.  Infrastructure and research studies at these sites can be augmented in several ways to substantially and quickly increase understanding of climate-carbon interactions.  One way is through upgrading the precision and accuracy of basic long term climate measurements, of which precipitation is one, to the level of NOAA’s US Climate Research Network (USCRN).  This upgrade will provide the detailed information to characterize climate change at these sites and will contribute towards identifying climate change across the US.  This will involve close partnership with NOAA.  The precipitation measurement instruments used must match exactly to what is used by the NOAA USCRN.  The Forest Service intends to share data with that network and the Belfort gauges are the latest required precipitation gauges from NOAA.

This requirement is now posted as a joint synopsis/solicitation to www.fbo.gov as of May 5, 2010. Those contractors not downloading the solicitation from this website shall e-mail mparlett@fs.fed.us for a copy. All questions on this requirement are to be in writing and e-mailed to mparlett@fs.fed.us at least 2 days prior to the due date. Proposals will be due on May 14, 2010 no later than 3:00 pm EDT.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy techniques developed at the INL allow for monitoring of the cement curing process, as well as monitoring of the long-term performance of cement structures. The process provides a simple, non-destructive, and inexpensive method to determine the relative permeability, stability, and durability of cementatious systems. In addition to providing a valuable technique for the construction industry, this work could also facilitate the implementation of jet grouting and other in situ grouting techniques for waste remediation.</p>

<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="COLOR: #010202">Textile mills have relied on current technology for over 100 years, but supercritical sizing may tempt the industry to try a better -- cheaper, faster, smaller and cleaner -- method. The size is transported in a very high pressure "supercritical fluid" that has both liquid and gas properties. The mixture is forced into threads as they pass through pressure gradient tubes. As the pressure drops, the supercritical fluid turns back into gas, and the sizing is left behind. The technology was developed under a joint DOE-industry initiative to reduce energy use in the textile industry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="COLOR: #010202">Before threads can be woven into fabric, they must be "sized," a process that adds a strengthening and smoothing coating to the thread.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Idaho National Laboratory has devised a cheaper, faster, smaller, and more environmentally correct method for coating threads with size, one that replaces centuries-old technology.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>

STATEMENT OF WORK 

1.Background

The Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) and Novel Devices Group, in the Semiconductor Electronics Division, of the Electronics and Electrical Engineering Laboratory, at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg, MD has an urgent need to develop new approaches to the measurement of ultra-small capacitances (to the atto-Farad or 10-18 Farad range) for rapidly emerging industrial applications. One part of this effort is to develop capacitance sensing circuits that can be implemented as single, silicon integrated-circuits that can be easily integrated with the devices to be measured. 
Two test chips are to be designed and submitted to the MOSIS foundry service for fabrication. CHIP-1 will contain various experimental implementations of the charge based capacitance measurement (CBCM) circuit, interfaced to internal metal-oxide-semiconductor devices, and also directly accessible via bonding pad to external devices. CHIP-2 will be designed based on test results from the first chip. This chip will contain a reduced set of improved design CBCM devices, including implementations that can be interfaced by wire bonding to an atomic force microscope (AFM) probe tip for direct capacitance characterization of external devices. Ultimate performance goal of the capacitance measurement is to be able to quantitatively measure the capacitance-voltage characteristics of the gate capacitance of a nanowire field effect transistor and similarly small device capacitances.
NIST requires the services of an engineer with experience with integrated circuit layout in a format compatible with the requirements of the MOSIS foundry service; extensive analog, high-sensitivity electronic circuit design and implementation experience; experience designing unique approaches to measurement electronics pushing the boundaries of current and voltage detection; and experience with design, creation, and test of sensors and electronics integrated into a system on a chip.

2.General Requirements

•Safety.  All NIST safety and building evacuation procedures are to be observed during the performance of the contract by the contractor.
•Patent rights.  The government retains government use license to all inventions that may be achieved in the course of this research.
•Federal Holidays.  NIST will be closed on federal holidays, tasks that require access to NIST facilities must be accomplished on days that NIST is open.

3.Scope of Work

The work is divided into three major tasks:  1) Design and layout of a CBCM test chip (CHIP-1) with various implementations of CBCM transmission gate circuits in order to determine the best design ideas for our intended application, 2) Assistance with the testing of CHIP-1, and 3) Design and layout of a prototype ultra-small capacitance measurement circuit integrated on a single integrated circuit chip (CHIP-2) suitable for interface with an AFM. These tasks are further elaborated below.

An important consideration throughout the course of this project is the effect of the ac frequency of the capacitance measurement. Commonly, the capacitances of MOS devices are measured from the quasi-static regime to 1 MHz (though some researchers have developed RF capacitance characterization techniques to ~ 100 MHz).  Still higher frequencies, to ~ 10 GHz, may have utility in this work. Additional information can be acquired at high frequencies, but the measurements become proportionally more difficult to conduct correctly. The effect of measurement frequency and the appropriate measurement frequency should be considered in all phases and reports of this work. A major justification for pursing this approach to capacitance measurement is the presumed measurement performance gains from merging the capacitance sensor with the device to be characterized into a platform that eliminates a probe station, physical probes, and almost all of the associated wiring.

4.Deliverables and Reports

BASIS FOR AWARD

The Government may reject any or all quotations if such action is in the Government’s interest. The Government intends to evaluate quotations and award a purchase order without discussions with Offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the Offeror’s initial quotation should contain the Offeror’s best terms from a cost/price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary.

EVALUATION FACTORS: 

The Government will evaluate quotations based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability 2) Past Performance, and 3) Price. 

a. Technical and Past Performance are equal in value, and when combined is more important than price. 

b. The Government reserves the right to award to other than the lower-priced offer for better technical capability and/or better performance records.  

1.   Technical Approach: Evaluation of technical Capability shall be based on the information provided in the quotation that demonstrates the degree of offeror’s understanding of fulfilling the requirements outlined in the Statement of Work and the contractor’s ability to perform the requirements.

2.  Past Performance: Evaluation of this factor will be based on information contained in the technical portion of the quotation and information provided by references. The Government will evaluate past performance information by contacting appropriate references, including NIST references, if applicable. The Government may also consider other available information in evaluating the Offeror’s past performance. The Government will assign a neutral rating if the offeror has no relevant past performance information. 

3. Price will be evaluated for reasonableness in consistency with the technical quote. The price evaluation will determine whether the proposed price is realistic, complete and reasonable in relation to the solicitation requirements.

Background Information

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation’s foremost federally funded biomedical research institution.  It is comprised of twenty-seven Institutes, Centers and Divisions.  The Warren G. Magnuson Clinical Center is the on-site 267-bed hospital for the NIH campus comprised of clinical, laboratory and administrative staff who support the Institutes as they conduct clinical research working with inpatients and outpatients participating in research studies at the NIH.  The Department of Anesthesia and Surgical Services (DASS) provides surgical services support for patients enrolled in the experimental protocols of several Institutes.  

The Department of Anesthesia and Surgical Services provides support for several research protocols that demand surgical interventions.  Many of these surgical interventions can produce physical deformities that require reconstructive interventions.  The Clinical Center has a critical need to establish a contract for a plastic surgeon to provide such services. 

General Requirements

The plastic surgeon contractor will be responsible, in concert with the primary consult surgeon, to consult on patients, perform pre-surgical evaluation, surgical plastic surgery procedures, and post operative follow up.  The selected vendor will perform all services onsite and work at the direction of the attending NIH surgeon.  Examples of cases performed at the Clinical Center include, but are not limited to:  Adjacent tissue transfer, scalp; subcutaneous mastectomy; reduction mammoplasty; implant reconstruction; NAC reconstruction; Latissimus reconstruction; TRAM; capsulectomy.  

Location, Time and Duration of Services

Provide professional plastic surgery services at the NIH Clinical Center upon the request of the attending NIH surgeon. The surgery will be scheduled at a mutually agreed upon time by all parties involved.  Normal operating room hours are Monday through Friday between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 3:30 p.m., exclusive of Federal holidays.  All coordination of cases will be the responsibility of the attending NIH surgeon.  All current standard operating procedures for scheduling of cases within DASS will remain in effect.  Services shall be conducted within the designated operating suites and clinics in the NIH Clinical Center.  NIH shall provide and maintain all equipment and supplies necessary for the contractor to carry out the services as specified herein.  Medical drugs and supplies required for patient use will be supplied by the NIH.  

The initial period of perform will be for 12 months from the award date of the purchase order.  The government has the unilateral right to extend the terms of services for an additional 2 one year period.  FAR 52.217-9 is hereby incorporate within this order.  If the options are excised pricing would be from the most current Medicare CPT Code price listing.  Variable surgical caseload precludes the NIH from establishing a set schedule, however for pricing purposes it is estimated 15 procedures of various degrees of complexities will be performed during the initial 12 month period of performance.   The In the event that the number of cases increases beyond the original estimated number the Government will make a determination as to whether or not it wishes to increase the current funds obligated.  If the Government decides to provide additional funding it will be through a bilateral modification of the purchase order.  Again, the pricing is based upon the most current 150% of the Medicare CPT Code cost per procedures list.   
Base Year-               July 1, 2010 through June 30, 2011
First Option Year-     July 1, 2011 through June 30, 2012
Second OptionYear-July 1, 2012 through June 30, 2013

Specific Task Requirements

1.	The contractor will be a licensed in a state, territory or commonwealth of the United States or District of Columbia, with board certification/eligibility in Plastic Surgery.
2.	The contractor will provide personal medical liability insurance at the standard $1 million per claim/$3M aggregate.

For line items covered by the WTO GPA, the Government will evaluate offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American Act. The Government will consider for award only offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products unless the Contracting Officer determines that there are no offers for such products or that the offers for such products are insufficient to fulfill the requirements of the solicitation. <br />(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

(Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] <br />[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that- <br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and <br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />[ ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1).

(Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.) <br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). <br />(2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:<br />Commandant (CG-9131), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, Procurement Planning &amp; Oversight Division<br />900 Half St. SW, JR11-0203, Washington, DC 20593, Telephone: (202) 372-3692 Fax: (202) 475-3904</p>

<p>5. MAINTAINING, REPORTING, AND DISPOSING OF GOVERNMENT PROPERTY IN THE PERFORMANCE OF A SHIP REPAIR CONTRACT</p>
<p>1. The Government Property Clause incorporated by reference delineates the Contractor's overall responsibility when taking possession of government property in performance of a contract. In performance of this contract the Contractor will be required to properly identify, track and control property within its possession. This includes, a) property furnished by the government (GFP) to the Contractor in conjunction with specific CLIN Items. These items and their values are listed in the specification, b) property that is pre-existing in a location that during the course of performance will be replaced or renewed. <br /><br />2. The items listed in the specification, as government furnished property will be provided in the quantities designated. Government furnished property may be provided in person by an official Coast Guard employee, shipment via commercial carrier, etc. The Contractor shall sign for all government furnished property using either a DD Form 1149, entitled, "Requisition and Invoice/Shipping Document" or a DD Form 1348, entitled, "Issue Release/Receipt Document". A copy of the DD 1149 or DD 1348 must be sent within 48 hours of receipt of property, to the designated Government Property Administrator. The name of the individual assigned as Property Administrator will be furnished to the Contractor at time of award. The Contractor shall not take receipt of property that is not listed in the specification, has not been previously identified as becoming part of the contract (via contract modification) or which otherwise cannot be identified. Such irregularities shall be immediately reported to the Property Administrator.</p>
<p>3. The Contractor shall complete the report provided herein, entitled, "Government Property Report". This report is intended as a living document whereby relevant fields shall be filled in, maintained and kept current at all times. All property described in paragraph 1 (a and b) above shall be reported on the report. At contract completion the Contractor and the Property Administrator shall ensure that all fields are appropriately completed. A signature block is provided at the end of the report for both parties to attest to the report's accuracy and completeness. The Government Property Report shall clearly delineate the complete track that all Government property took over the course of the contract. This completed report must accompany the Contractor's final invoice. Final payment may be delayed, without penalty of interest, until such time as the report is received. A separate copy of the completed report and any final DD 1149s or DD 1348s executed, as a result of carrying out disposition instructions shall be provided to the Property Administrator.<br /><br />4. Pursuant to the Government Property Clause the authority to render disposition instructions of Government property associated with this contract is delegated to the Property Administrator. The Contractor shall comply with all instructions in the contract for the return of government property to the Coast Guard. This includes government property taken off the vessel (shafts, propellers, etc.), government property returned to the vessel (special tools, etc.) or surplus government property not used during performance of the contract.</p>
<p>6. CONTRACTING OFFICER'S AUTHORITY:<br />No oral or written statement of any person other than the Contracting Officer will in any manner or degree modify or otherwise affect the terms of this contract. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to approve changes in any of the requirements under this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, said authority remains solely with the Contracting Officer. In the event the Contractor effects any such change at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract price to cover any increase in cost incurred as a result thereof.<br /><br />7. CONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE EVALUATION <br />The resultant Contractor's performance will be evaluated throughout the contract period for inclusion into a Contractor Performance Report (evaluation) by the end user(s) for use by this agency and other Government agencies on future source selection award decisions. The report will be completed by the assigned Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) at the completion of the contract. Upon review by the Contracting Officer, the results will be provided to the Contractor who will be given a period of thirty days to review and provide comments. Contractor comments will be reviewed and considered by the Contracting Officer. In the case of a contract with option years, an interim report will be completed on the anniversary date of the contract each year. The areas to be evaluated are:</p>
<p>Quality of Product or Service Meeting SDB Subcontracting Requirements (as applicable):<br />Cost Control (as applicable)<br />Subcontractors<br />Timeliness of Performance<br />Contractor Manager/Principal Investigator<br />Business Relations<br />Overall Comment <br /><br />Each area will be evaluated using the following adjectival scale: Outstanding (5), Excellent (4), Good (3), Fair (2), Poor (1), and Unsatisfactory (0).</p>
<p>The performance evaluation process will be accomplished by all participants electronically using the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Contractor Performance System (CPS) via the Internet. The CPS is an all-inclusive system with many built-in levels of security designed to safeguard your performance evaluation throughout the entire process. Unless already registered, the Contractor is required, upon award, to register with NIH. To do so, the Contractor shall go to https://cpsContractor.nih.gov. In order to ensure that the Contracting Officer provides the correct person electronic access to the performance evaluation report for review and comment, the Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer, (1) the Primary Contractor representatives name, e-mail address, telephone number and unique identifier and (2) the Secondary Contractor representatives name, e-mail address and telephone number. This information must be relayed to the Contracting Officer exactly as provided at time of NIH registration. The Contracting Officer will contact the Contractor for this information, upon award. The Contractor will receive a system generated e-mail notification when the performance evaluation for this contract is ready for review. The Contractor will access the Contractor Module of the system, review the evaluation and submit desired comments. The notification e-mail will contain instructions for the Contractor's Representative to log in with his or her unique ID in order to obtain a personal identification number (PIN). The PIN may be used to access this Contractor's evaluation only, and will be deactivated after the evaluation has been reviewed and comments have been submitted. The Contractor should be mindful that the system provides thirty days to electronically submit comments.</p>
<p>If no comments are received during the thirty-day period, the system will automatically set the evaluation to completed status and will incorporate a statement to the effect that no comments were received within the time limit. The fully completed report is automatically sent to the Contractor by the system for viewing and may, at that time, be printed. The Contractor is encouraged to visit https://cpsContractor.nih.gov , CPS Info, Contractor Information, to become familiar with the system and the on-line Contractor User's Manual. NIH charges the Coast Guard a usage charge, per user, based on time spent in the system. Therefore, promptly log off the system when not in use.</p>
<p>8. INSPECTIONS:<br />Except as specified elsewhere, the U.S. Coast Guard shall rely on the Contractor to accomplish all inspection and testing needed to ensure that the work conforms to contract quality requirements.</p>
<p>Records of all inspection work by the Contractor shall be kept complete and available to the Government during the term of this contract and for such longer period as may be specified elsewhere in this contract.</p>
<p>The name and telephone number of the U.S. Coast Guard Inspector will be provided after the award of a contract resulting from this solicitation.</p>
<p>9. GROWTH WORK:<br />(a) The Contractor shall not perform growth work without the Contracting Officer's authorization. Growth work is work within the scope of the contract, which has not been previously priced as a pre-priced CLIN. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to contract for growth work on the basis of a negotiated, firm, fixed price, when it is in the best interest of the Government. If a firm-fixed price contract is awarded, and during the performance period a repair within scope is identified but the Contracting Officer and Contractor are unable to agree on the cost of the work, a bilateral modification may be incorporated into the contract using a Time and Materials modification for this specific repair. In this situation, FAR 52.212-4, Alternate I will be incorporated.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor shall furnish a price breakdown directly to the Contracting Officer, itemized as required by the Contracting Officer, of any proposal submitted for a contract modification. Unless otherwise directed, the breakdown shall be submitted on an MLCA 002 proposal form provided at the arrival conference permitting an analysis of all materials, labor, equipment, subcontract, overhead costs, and profit covering all work involved in the change/modification whether such work was deleted, added or changed. Any amount claimed for subcontracts shall be supported by a separate, similar price breakdown. If the proposal includes a request for a time extension, justification shall be furnished with the proposal.</p>
<p>(c) This clause is to be used in conjunction with the clause COMPOSITE LABOR RATE incorporated into this solicitation. The Contractor is required to have and/or furnish all tools and equipment incidental to each bench trade. Supplies such as wiping rags, hacksaw blades, sandpaper, welding wire, helium, etc., are also to be furnished by the Contractor. Other materials are to be charged at regular rates and prices currently in effect and as agreed to by the Contracting Officer. Material shall be best commercial quality available except where a precise specification is indicated in which case the specification shall apply, e.g., MILSPEC, FEDERAL SPEC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;10. COMPOSITE LABOR RATE: <br />The composite labor rate offered shall be the sole labor hour rate used to price the prime Contractor's direct labor hours for contract changes, i.e. growth work. The Contractor shall not receive any compensation in addition to this rate for the prime Contractor's direct labor associated with such changes under this contract.</p>
<p>(a) The composite labor hour rate shall represent total compensation for the following:<br />(1) direct labor wages and salaries;<br />(2) all employee benefits including, but not limited to, paid leave, supplemental pay, insurance, retirement, savings, and legally required benefits;<br />(3) other direct costs associated with transit time, delay, disruption, expendable supplies, and equipment;<br />(4) all indirect costs such as overhead and general and administrative expense;<br />(5) any port or association fees, rents, or other levies;<br />(6) profit (fee); and<br />(7) all direct and indirect costs and profit associated with the following support functions:<br />Supervision and Management Planning and Estimating<br />Material Handling Housekeeping<br />Engineering Transportation/Drivers<br />Quality Assurance Contract Administration<br />Security Testing</p>
<p>(b) The composite labor hour rate will be applied to production labor hours only. Production labor hours include only those hours necessary and reasonable to perform direct production functions and do not include the hours expended on the support functions listed above. This exclusion of support function hours applies whether such support functions are normally charged directly or indirectly by the Contractor's accounting system. These support functions are to be priced into the composite labor rate quoted and shall not be separately compensated.</p>
<p>(c) The Quantity of Composite Labor hours indicated in the Schedule of Supplies/Services is only an estimate and is an Optional Item pursuant to this solicitation. The Estimated Quantity represents the Government's best estimate of the total number of additional hours that may be required throughout the contract. The Government may elect to exceed this value at the prices stated in the schedule and its discretion during performance of the contract. The inclusion of this item does not obligate the Government to exercise the item nor entitle the Contractor to compensation if not exercised.</p>
<p>11. METHOD OF PAYMENT AND INVOICING INSTRUCTIONS FOR SHIP REPAIR:<br />Invoices submitted by the Contractor which are deemed not proper, in accordance with FAR clause, 52.212-4 will be returned. Invoices shall include (see the clause for a full summation of invoice requirements):</p>

<p>The Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number is the primary identifier in Central Contractor Registration (CCR), (see FAR 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer - Central Contractor Registration (OCT 2003)). Contractors are located and identified in CCR by their DUNS number. Therefore, to facilitate payment, the DUNS number shall be recorded on every invoice submitted to the U.S. Coast Guard.</p>
<p>All items of work invoiced under this contract will be confirmed by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) as accurate and complete.</p>
<p>Any amount deemed not payable will be deducted from the Contractor's invoice. Deducted amounts may be resubmitted on the next invoice for reconsideration.</p>
<p>Additional work verbally agreed to by the parties that has not yet been incorporated into the contract by modification shall not be included in an invoice. Payments will not be made for any work to which a modification has not been properly executed. Invoices submitted for payment that includes such a request will be reduced by the unmodified amount.</p>
<p>Invoices shall be mailed to the designated billing office, as follows:<br />USCG Finance Center<br />1430A Kristina Way<br />Chesapeake, VA 23326</p>

(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  Price and Technical.  Technical is significantly less important than price.  (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).  (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.  <BR><BR>The Government intends to evaluate quotes and award one contract without discussions with Offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)). Therefore, the Offerors initial quote should contain the Offerors best terms from a price standpoint.

<DESC>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Question 1.  Timing:  We don't stock 11' long rails, so it will take us 60-90 day to fill this order.  I would be shock if you are able to find anyone that inventories this quantity or that has the ability to manufacture this order in a 30 day timeframe.  Is there a possibility the receiving date ARO can be stretched to accommodate the manufacturing time? 
Answer 1.  The date has been changed to 90 days ARO.
Question 2.  Shape:  Due to splitting the logs, we can't guarantee that the ends will always be triangularly shaped, but most of them will be.
Answer 2.  Not concerned about a perfect triangular shape.  More important is the issue that the rail not be sawn or give a sawn appearance.  If the rails are in fact split, (hand or mechanically) they will be fine.
Question 3. Size:  You mentioned minimum sizes, are there any maximum sizes?
Answer 3.  We would not want the ends (either) to be larger than seven or eight inches.   Eight inches would be the largest ends that we would be able to accept.
Question 4.  Bark: Does it matter if the logs have bark on them?
Answer 4.  No bark.
Question 5.  Sweep:  Do you have a max sweep that the rails cannot exceed?
Answer 5.  Sweep deviation should be no more than two or three inches.    Preferable no more than two inches.
Questiom 6.  Payment:  We normally require a deposit before initiating the splitting.  Are there any provisions for any type of payment either up front or a progressive payment along the course of the way? 
Answer 6.   Progress payment can be made as shipments are received.
Question 7.  Are the split rails to be Kiln dried. If so, what is the moisture content after being kiln dried? 
Answer 7.  Not required to be kiln dried.
Question 8.  Is Black Locust the same as Yellow Locust? 
Answer 8.  Many people refer to black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) as yellow locust.  Yellow locust is not the correct name but since the inner wood is a yellowish/ brown color, many folks call it yellow.   We are only interested in the type of locust (which technically is the black locust) that is commonly used for fence posts in the southeast.   There is also a honey locust but that is not acceptable.  Again, what many folks call yellow locust is actually the black locust.
Question 9.  Am I correct that the extented price should include the frieght? 
Answer 9.  Yes.  We have to consider freight costs to see how many pieces we can afford purchase.
Question 10.  Am I correct that the unit price should reflect the freight cost per piece? 
Answer 10.  Yes,  the unit price should reflect the freight cost per piece.
Question 11.   What are the zip codes for the three delivery areas?
Answer 11.  The Big Island VA zip is:  24526The Floyd VA zip is: 24091The Laurel Spring NC zip is: 28644

<DESC>Question and Answers

Question :  What is this duration of this contract?

Answer: As stated in the pre-solicitation notice, project phasing is anticipated based on dollar value and funding.  The number of phases depends ultimately on fiscal year funding availability and number of phases of the construction project.   At this point there is no way to accurately predict the duration of this project.  At this point we do not anticipate it will go beyond December, 2013 but may take less time.

Question: Are we required to have both a business license in the state of West Virginia,  and professional engineers registered in the state of West Virginia to pursue this contract?

Answer: West Virginia has a separate state license requirement in this state. A/E firms from out of state have to have a business license by the State of West Virginia.  For more information you can visit West Virginia State Secretary website at www.sos.wv.gov/.  You can also contact the "West Virginia Board of Architecture".    Their website is www.wvbrdarch.org and explains most of the requirement and their number is (304) 528-5825.  

Question: We do not currently have a business license in WV, but can get one.  Would you still consider us for this opportunity if we agreed to get a license if we are awarded the project?

Answer: You must be licensed in WV and registered prior to award.

Question:   Are you looking for an architecture firm to be the prime consultant or an MEP engineering firm to be the prime consultant?  

Answer: The NAICS code for this project is 541310 Architectural Services.  The definition of this code is This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in planning and designing residential, institutional, leisure, commercial, and industrial buildings and structures by applying knowledge of design, construction procedures, zoning regulations, building codes, and building materials. You are welcome to submit a SF-330 and we will determine if you are qualified

<DESC>Please see attached compilation of questions with answers.....
Please see attached amendment: the due date for offers in response to this solicitation is hereby extended until 2:00 PM, EDST May 10,2010. A signed acknowledgement of this amendment must accompany all offers. 
Background
The Federal Aviation Administration Engineering Development Services Navigation team (AJP-652) has been tasked with supporting the development of Category III (CAT III) avionics for the Local Area Augmentation System (LAAS).  The Navigation Team requires the support of an avionics manufacturer in order to implement the use of additional messages and algorithms as described in RTCA DO-246D and DO-253C in a commercial platform.  The Navigation Team proposes the modification of a currently existing commercially available package in production or development.  
The Navigation Team, with guidance from the Satellite Program Office, AJW 432, has selected a commercial platform for this effort because air carriers are currently procuring and installing MultiMode receivers or other highly integrated avionics packages into their fleet aircraft.  The FAA currently utilizes similar receivers for use with LAAS in Terminal Instrument Procedures (TERPS) data collection, Flight Inspection, and LAAS Ground Facility (LGF) tests.  
Objective
The objective of the contract is to supply the Navigation Team and LAAS program participants as identified by the SATNAV program office with red label (non-certified) equipment for use in requirements validation efforts.  These efforts include, but are not limited to data collection in conjunction with prototype CAT III ground equipment, TERPS testing, procedure development, LGF testing, and Flight Inspection requirements development.

<DESC>The Contracting Department, Fleet and Industrial Supply Center (FISC), Norfolk, VA, 23511-3392 intends to negotiate a multiple award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity hybrid type contract with both Firm Fixed Price and Cost Plus Fixed Fee pricing provisions and will utilize procedures under FAR Part 15 "Contracting by Negotiation".
The contractor shall provide IT services for the Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) Navy Enterprise Network (ONE-NET), and to accomplish migration of business support and command and control (C2) systems from legacy networks to ONE-NET.  ONE-NET provides 24/7/365 NIPRNet/SIPRNet access, network connectivity and security, electronic mail and Blackberry, file and print services, voice over SIPRNet (VOSIP), web access, and desktop support via Theater Network Operations and Security Centers (TNOSCs) and the Local Network Support Centers (LNSCs) located at Fleet concentration areas throughout OCONUS.  
This 24/7/365 capability includes the functional areas of Network and Systems Operations (Fault, Configuration, Accounting, Performance, and Security (FCAPS) Management, Network Defense (ND), Common Applications Support, and Transport Services).  Additional support extends into Service Desk, Field Services, Information Assurance, Network Technical Support, IT Service Management, Enterprise Management Support, Voice Over Internet & Telephone Support, and Theater Application Support. Through Program Executive Office (PEO) for Enterprise Information Systems (EIS), ONE-NET infrastructure is installed at fourteen (14) overseas fleet concentration areas, owned and operated by NAVY CYBERFOR. 
The ONE-NET infrastructure is comprised of three (3) TNOSCs located at Yokosuka (Japan), Naples (Italy), and Manama (Bahrain). TNOSCs function as the single point of contact for the network operations and the focal point for decisions for regional customers. These decisions involve service priorities, restoration priorities, and other enterprise-wide operational issues within their region. Service is primarily focused on Network and Systems Operations, Service Desk, Network Technical Support and Information Assurance.  The Yokosuka TNOSC services the Far East Theater and the Naples and Bahrain TNOSCs service the Europe and Middle East theaters respectively.  These three theaters are under the operational control of Naval Computer Telecommunications Area Master Station (NCTAMS) Pacific (PAC) and NCTAMS Atlantic (LANT).
LNSCs are extensions of a TNOSC where physical presence is required.  Service at this level shall be primarily hardware-related and limited to device and cable plant maintenance, component replacement, and providing the on-site touch labor to respond to service requests and system problems that cannot be resolved by the TNOSC remotely.  LNSC supports life-cycle maintenance activities and ONE-NET service level objectives by providing touch-labor associated with the refresh and warranty repair of devices attached to the ONE-NET network.
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541513, Computer Facilities Management Services, and the Size Standard is $25.0M.  This prospective Request for Proposal (RFP) will be processed utilizing "Full and Open Competition", and will not contain a required Small Business Subcontracting Plan as FAR Part 19 does not apply OCONUS.
The resulting contract will be for the period of a twelve (12) month base year and four (4) twelve month option years along with FAR Clause 52.217-8 "Option to Extend Services".  All options will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 17.206(a).  A complete RFP package will be available by downloading the documents at the NECO Website as follows: http://www.neco.navy.mil on or around 28 June 2010.  Potential contractors are hereby notified that the solicitation and subsequent amendments to the solicitation will ONLY be available for download at the above site; this office will no longer issue hard copy solicitations. By submitting an offer, the vendor is self-certifying that neither the requestor nor the principal corporate officials and owners are currently suspended, debarred, or otherwise ineligible to receive contracts from any federal agency. Failure to do so may represent grounds for refusing to accept the offer. By submission of an offer, the contractor acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee must be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation, except for awards to foreign vendors for work to be performed outside the United States. Lack of registration in the CCR database will make a contractor ineligible for award. Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov.  Please direct all questions regarding this requirement via e-mail to the POC identified in this synopsis.

Chardon Street in the Hato Rey area of San Juan.&nbsp; The existing Federico Degetau Federal Office Building (FOB) is located on the most western section of the site and will remain in place.<br /><br />&nbsp;This project will be designed under GSA's design excellence program and will make a distinct architectural statement that is responsive to the existing structures on the site and provides the FBI with a facility that will meet their current security requirements and space needs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The new facility will meet the FBI's ISC level four (4) security criteria including all setbacks, progressive collapse, and blast resistance requirements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The new facilities will be energy efficient and must achieve at a minimum a LEED silver rating from the U.S. Green Building Council. Additionally, the project is located in an area designated to have a .02% annual chance of flooding (500 year flood event), as such the resulting design will mitigate the risk associated with this event.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Design funding for this project was provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A portion of this funding was used by the General Services Administration to procure the services of an A/E firm to produce a master plan and garage design for the federal site.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This master plan will be the basis for the design of the FBI facility. A separate A/E firm has been selected for the design of this project. A CM agent has also been selected for the project.</p>
<p>&nbsp;This procurement is for the selection of a highly qualified General Contractor (GC) firm interested in providing design phase services and construction services for this new facility. The scope of work will include, but not be limited to, reviewing and evaluating design submissions, providing cost estimates, providing value engineering suggestions, and construction of the new facility.</p>
<p><span style="COLOR: red">&nbsp;</span>GSA intends to contract for construction services that offers the best overall value to the Government by demonstrating a commitment to construction excellence, by providing and maintaining a viable team organization and by adherence to the budgetary and time parameters of this project.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Th Estimated Construction Cost Range for this project is between $120,000,000 and $130,000,000. Funds allocated via <a href="http://www.recovery.gov/">www.recovery.gov</a> reflect funds for design of the entire project and construction of a separate parking garage currently under construction. Construction funding for this project will be requested in the FY2012 capital program request.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The Request for Qualifications (RFQ) is scheduled to be issued on or about June 1, 2010, via FedBizOps (http://www.fbo.gov/). A pre-proposal conference date will be posted on the FedBizOps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;All correspondence in response to this announcement must clearly indicate the Solicitation Number. The design of this project is being funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) for 2009. Reporting documents from the Contractor are mandated per the act. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PRICE OR TECHNICAL PROPOSALS.</p>

<DESC>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).<br><br><BR>RATIONALE FOR CONTRACT AWARD THAT IS NOT FIXED PRICE:  This is a R&D type contract in support of the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) issued against BAA-09-0001.  Cost contracts are suitable for use when uncertainties involved in contract performance do not permit cost to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract.  The nature of development work often requires a cost arrangement.  In addition, appropriate Government surveillance during performance will provide reasonable assurance that efficient methods and cost controls are used.<BR>

<DESC>Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition (J&amp;A)<br /><br />Authority: (10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1) &ensp;&ensp;<br /><br />Project/Program Name: FINLOG Web Services for Supply and Financial Data. <br />Component: USASOC G-4, Systems Management Division.<br />Estimated Contract Cost (including options): <br />Type J&amp;A: (Individual 1 or Class 0)&nbsp; J&amp;A No. 10-006
<p>1. Agency and Contracting Activity: (FAR 6.303-2(a)(1))<br /><br />Agency: USASOC G-4, Systems Management Division <br />Contracting Activity: Deputy Chief of Staff, Acquisition and Contracting, United States Army Special Operations Command, Building E-2929, Fort Bragg, North Carolina 28310.<br /><br />2. Description of Action: (FAR 6.303-2(a)(2))<br />Approval is requested for a new contract award. The action will be awarded as a firm fixed price award. The period of performance will be a base for 12 months from 01 May 2010 - 30 April 2011 with four 1-year options. This requirement will be funded with FY2010, MFP11 Funds. <br /><br />3. Description of Supplies/Services: (FAR 6.303-2(a)(3))<br />The United States Special Operations Command (USASOC) G-4, Systems Management Division, has a requirement for FINLOG service which provides access to a database driven website developed to provide a centralized supply and financial database for the Army. The products shall include interfaces with resource management related systems, specifically an interface to SARSS that provides logistics cost data and information, and building web based services to meet the design requirements of the commands network to include all USASOC units regardless of geographical location. The estimated award amount for all years is <br /><br />4. Authority Cited: (FAR 6.303-2(a)(4))<br />1 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.<br /><br />5. Reason for Authority Cited: (FAR 6.303-2(a)(5))<br />With the fielding of the Standard Army Retail Supply System (SARSS) within the United States Army, many financial interface issues with the Command Commodity Supply System (CCSS), Standard Army Retail Supply System (SARSS), and Standard Army Financial System (STANFINS) have surfaced. FINLOG provides a centralized SUPPLY/FINANCIAL Web service with near real time (24 Hr) financial information tracking, tailored reports and queries, one stop research capability, and a means to validate financial input files. <br /><br />FINLOG is a proprietary computer product that is used by the United States Army. The product was originally created and developed by XOtech LLC. The personnel support for the FINLOG services included functional analysis, custom data inquiries, database management, help desk services, etc. <br /><br />In March 2006, the USASOC DCSAC issued a Request For Quotation (RFQ) on GSA e-BUY with a generic statement of work/specification for a web-based financial logistics system. Only one response was received and a task order H92239-06-F-0144 was awarded XOtech LLC against GSA Contract Number GS-10F-0469N. For a base year with four (4) one-year options. The period of performance for the base year was 01 May 2006 - 30 April 2007.<br /><br />In February 2009, prior to exercising the option year, XOtech requested a novation agreement against the task order. Effective December 31, 2008, XOtech transferred FINLOG to RapidFire Systems. The transfer included FINLOG and the people who provide the FINLOG services. Upon reviewing the document supporting the requested novation agreement, the contracting office found that GSA did not modify the GSA schedule to process a novation agreement to RapidFire. Additionally, GSA noted that FINLOG was not a scheduled item. Therefore, the DCSAC could not process the novation agreement or exercise the 3rd option year (01 May 2009 - 30 April 2010) of the existing task order.</p>
<p>Because FINLOG is a critical service for USASOC and there was a contract in place, the Government posted a notice of intent to negotiate a sole source purchase order to RapidFire. Award number H92239-09-P-0062 was awarded on 29 April 2009 with a period of performance of 01 May 2009 through 30 April 2010.<br /><br />As indicated above, the FINLOG services are proprietary and all rights, titles, and interest in the software product have been transferred from XOtech to RapidFire Systems. The FINLOG services are not available from any other sources. Therefore, a notice of intent to negotiate a sole source award for FINLOG services to RapidFire Systems will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. The award will be issued to RapidFire Systems, 51 Market Square Road, Suite G, Newnan, GA 30265. The period of performance will be for a base (1-year) starting 01 May 2010 - 30 April 2011 and four (1-year) options.<br /><br />6. Efforts/Actions to Increase Competition: (FAR 6.303-2(a)(6))<br />A notice of intent to negotiate a sole source award with RapidFire Systems will be publicized to the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website on 23 March 2010 as required by FAR 5.2. The notice will state that responsible sources capable of meeting the requirement may submit technical, delivery, pricing, and past performance data sufficient to determine capability to perform. Any responses received will be evaluated to determine if a competitive award can be made.<br /><br />7. Market Research: (FAR 6.303-2(a)(8))<br />A general Internet search for "FINLOG" returns information on Xotech's and RapidFire's websites. A search of GSA Advantage reveals no schedule holders that can provide the FINLOG services. The Technical Industrial Liaison Office (TILO), Office of Small Business Programs (OSBP), and USSOCOM Directorate IDIQ databases were reviewed as part of the market research process. However, none of these tools identified potential sources for this requirement. <br />The DCSAC and the requiring activity will continue to perform market research to identify potential products/services that will meet the Government's needs and sources that are capable of providing the necessary support.<br /><br />8. Interested Sources: (FAR 6.303-2(a)(10)&amp;(11))<br />To date, no sources have identified an interest in the requirement or the ability to provide the required services in response to the previously posted notice. As stated in paragraph 6 above, any responses received against the current notice of intent will be evaluated to determine if a competitive award can be made.</p>
<p>&nbsp;9. Other Facts: (FAR 6.303-2(a)(9))<br />N/A<br />&emsp;<br />10. Technical and Requirements Certification:<br />I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance which are included in the justification are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief:</p>

Prices are determined fair and reasonable based on a comparison of the prices awarded in the current task order.</p>
<p>CONTRACTING OFFICER SIGNATURE IN SECTION 12 BELOW ALSO SERVES AS THE PRICE FAIR AND REASONABLENESS DETERMINATION IN THIS SECTION.<br />12. Contracting Officer Certification:<br />I hereby certify that this J&amp;A is complete and accurate to the best of my knowledge and belief.</p>

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL
FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION
WIRELESS MEDICAL TELEMETRY SERVICE REGISTRATION

Upon the basis of the following justification, I hereby approve the issuance of the contractual action described below using other than full and open competition, pursuant to the authority cited herein.

1.  Requesting Agency: Department of Veterans Affairs:  
Telecommunications
810 Vermont Avenue NW, Room B-47
Washington, D.C. 20420
     

Contracting Activity: Center for Acquisition Innovation-Austin:
Contract Division 00D3
1615 Woodward Street
Austin, Texas 78772


2.  Nature of Action Being Approved:  This justification and approval sets forth the facts and request approval for the issuance of a sole-source contract with Comsearch for the performance of 12-months, from date of award with four option years.  The proposed life-cycle price is estimated at contract cost is estimated at $400,000.00, which includes a base year of $80,000.00 and $80,000.00 for each of the four one-year option periods.  


3.  Description of Service and Supplies: The Department of Veteran Affairs, Center for Acquisition and Innovation, plans to contract with Comsearch for deployment, registration and management service of high band frequency transmitters throughout VA Medical Centers on a soles-source basis. This service will provide frequency coordination registration for wireless medical telemetry (WMTS) equipment at all Veteran Administration's medical facilities. 

The objective of this contract is to successfully deploy and manage frequency transceiver and access points at regional VA Medical Centers to ensure secure and reliable communication between VA Medical Centers. 


4.  Statutory Authority:  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-(a)(2). The authority permits issuing a contact on a sole-source basis because this service is unique and is available from only one supplier (Comsearch).


5.  Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above: Federal Communications Commission (FCC) released an order designating the American Society for Health Care Engineering of the American Hospital Association (ASHE/AHA) to serve as the frequency coordinator for the Wireless Medical Telemetry Service (WMTS). The FCC also mandated that all transmitters operating in WMTS bands must be registered with ASHE to ensure interference-free operation. The ASHE then selected Comsearch as their technical partner in providing frequency coordination services. In addition, the FCC has also mandated that a database of all federal civilian WMTS equipment be maintained by one company, Comsearch.   

Below is an excerpt from the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 47, Telecommunication, Part 95.1121 that support this justification for other than full and open competition. 

TITLE 47 - Telecommunication, Chapter I - Federal Communication Commission, Subchapter D - Safety and Special Radio Services: Part 95 - Personal Radio Services, subpart h - Wireless Medical Telemetry Service (WMTS) - 95.1121 - Specific requirements for wireless medical telemetry devices operating in the 13951400 MHz and 14271429.5 MHz bands. 

Due to the critical nature of communications transmitted under this part, the frequency coordinator in consultation with the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) shall determine whether there are any Federal Government systems whose operations could affect, or could be affected by, proposed wireless medical telemetry operations in the 13951400 MHz and 14271429.5 MHz bands. The locations of government systems in these bands are specified in footnotes US351 and US352 of 2.106 of this chapter.


6.  Efforts to Solicit Potential Sources:  Justification and Approval for Other Than Full and Open Competition was posted to FedBizOpps on December 15 through December 31, 2009.  No vendor responded with objections or questions. Attached is the FedBizOpps Sources Sought Synopsis. 


7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable:  The Contracting Officer will determine that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable based on historical data from the previous contract, V200P-1766-101-7J7020 and current market prices for similar wireless registrations.  


8.  Market Research:  Market Researches was conducted by posting a presolicitaion notice on FedBizOpps, researching the FCC rule part 95 (47CFR 95, Subpart H), and internet research for the AHA/ASHE issue regulatory advisory. 

A Sources Sought Synopsis was posted to FedBizOPPS on December 15, 2009.  No interested parties responded to the synopsis: 
See Attachment 1: FedBizOpps-Presolicitation-Notice-Posting, and Synopsis.

A registry of frequencies must be maintained in a single location to eliminate the potential for duplicate frequency assignments which cause interference. Because of the safety of life issues, NTIA and FCC who shared the band designated one organization to manage the spectrum for WMTS and that organization is ASHE.

This is for spectrum management, not a product or service, only a Federal regulation of spectrum assignments.  The VA is not buying anything; VA is paying for a registration fee to protect against someone else using the same frequencies at the same place.  The VA does not own the spectrum, only reserved use at specific locations.  

Vets are being monitored on unprotected spectrum at multiple locations because the hospitals have deemed the risk of death due to interference as less than the risk of not monitored at all. That risk will continue until the frequencies get registered.

All efforts to find other potential sources were not effective, because based on the Federal Regulations there are no other vendors that can provide WMTS spectrum coordination for telemetry operations required by all VA Medical Hospital equipment. 
See attachment 2: FCC 00-211


9.  Other Supporting Data: N/A


10.  Other Interested Sources:  None


11.  Future Competitive Plans: Future plans for competition will be accomplished when there are more designated sources available from the FCC to provide coordination.                                                                           


12.  Future barriers to competition: Any subsequent acquisition will also be sole sourced to Comsearch because it was approved and selected as ASHE's technical partner.
