<DESC>The Spanish Ministry of Defense (MOD) intends to advertise for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on works and services within the framework of the NATO Security Investment Program. Eligible firms will be invited to bid for the provision and installation of hardware and software upgrades for Allied Land Component Command Headquarters Madrid (CC-Land HQ Madrid) and the NATO Communication and Information Systems Services Agency (NCSA) Sector Madrid (Phase 2).

The MOD is serving as the Host Nation for this project, which was authorized by the NATO Infrastructure Committee. The MOD intends to use the basic (one step/one envelope) bidding procedure. 

The estimated value of this project is Euro 1.1 million ($1.5 million). The reference of the Invitation for International Bid (IFB) is P36-2Ph-CCL-Madrid and all communications related to this project will use that reference. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the reference IFB-SPAIN-P36-2PH-CCL-MADRID.

As the execution of the project requires access to restricted areas of military installations, contractor personnel must be in possession of a security clearance at the level of NATO SECRET or higher. Please note that it is the responsibility of the contractor to ensure that the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) forwards to the Host Nation the NATO clearance certifications for all personnel assigned to the contract.

SCOPE OF PROJECT

The project includes provision of following equipment and services:

- Desktop workstations and peripheral equipment (printers and scanners)
- Networking hardware and local cable and wiring support
- Servers to support Firewall, DBMS, EMS, anti-virus, storage and Windows 2003 infrastructure services
- Data storage (SAN and backup tape library)
- Hardware/software to support security service requirements
- Contractor support to install the system, and, if required, to perform the system transition services that may be required

BIDDING PROCEDURE 

The U.S. Department of Commerce does not serve as the Host Nation for NATO projects. Its role is to approve for bidding those firms of NATO-member nations with a facility located within the United States. Only firms approved by the U.S. Department of Commerce will be allowed to bid. Please visit the following website for instructions on applying for approval to bid on NATO projects: 

http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm

A firm that has been approved for bidding on NATO projects must request that the U.S. Department of Commerce issue a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for each project on which the firm wishes to bid. The DOE is used to nominate the firm to the Bidders List for a particular project. The U.S. Department of Commerce forwards the DOE to the U.S. Embassy, which in turn forwards it to the Host Nation. The Host Nation will not accept requests for nomination received directly from firms.

Firms that the U.S. Embassy nominates to the Bidders List will be contacted directly by the Host Nation when the Invitation for International Bidding (IFB) has been issued.

<DESC>The National Institute on Aging, IRP, intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis with Dr. Jose Pablo Liedo Fernandez, Mexico for a project studying how lifespan is regulated by dietary supplements.  The Laboratory of Experimental Gerontology (LEG) has previously utilized the Mexican fruit flies (Mexflies) to investigate the effects of dietary supplementation of tocopherols (Vitamin E) on lifespan. The contractor will provide the following services that will be conducted under the director of LEG scientists:  1) Establish a large scale screen module to allow simultaneously using a large number of Mexflies for lifespan assays in the Moscafrut mass-rearing facility at Tapachula in the state of Chiapas, Mexico; 2) Assist in the design of prolongevity studies to ensure the consistent quality of lifespan assays in Mexflies in Mexico; 3) Meet and email communication with LEG personnel to review progress, answer questions, and provide expert advice in support of ongoing prolongevity studies; 4) Perform prolongevity screen to identify compounds that extend lifespan in Mexflies in Mexico; 5) Perform assays to evaluate the effects of prolongevity compounds on various behaviors of Mexflies; 6) Collect and analyze data; 7) Provide targets and advices for investigate molecular mechanisms by which the target compounds extend lifespan in Drosophila Melanogaster in LEG and 8) participate as a co-author in the preparation and submission of manuscripts.  Only one responsible source and no other supplier or services will satisfy agency requirements, 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1 (b) (1).   The cited authority is applicable because Dr. Fernandez is the only source that can fulfill the requirements of this contract.  Dr. Fernandez has expert credentials to meet the requirements for this contract.  He has more than 20 years of solid training and experience in biology of aging, and he is an internationally recognized expert in the use of the Mexflies and Medflies for demographic studies in aging.  He has managed the fly research facilities for more than 20 years and is familiar with using Medflies and Mexflies to conduct aging-related research.  The contract services Dr. Fernandez will manage will be provided at the Moscafrut mass-rearing facility located in Tapachula in the state of Chiapas, Mexico, which is one of the rare Mexfly facilities in the world for pest control by applying the sterile insect technique.  This facility is highly organized, well run and is routinely generating millions of high quality Mexflies daily, which is essential for a large scale prolongevity screen specified in this contract.    One of the most significant findings made by Dr. Fernandez and his collaborators was published in top scientists Journal Science in 1992, which used Medflies to show that life expectancy of old animals increased instead of decreased with age.  The period of performance is 12 months.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) is 541990 and the size standard is 500. This acquisition is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition procedures and is exempt from the requirements of FAR, Part 6, Competition Requirement.

<DESC>The Environmental Protection Agency has a requirement to provide support for the ambient air monitoring and quality assurance program in support of the Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS), Central Operations and Resources.  The ambient air monitoring and quality assurance program focuses on issues concerning implementation and operation of national, state/local, and tribal air monitoring networks.  In addition, the program addresses the quality of the measurement data of the criteria air pollutants (carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), lead (Pb), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and various sizes of particulate matter (PM10, PM10-2.5, PM2.5), chemical speciation of particulate matter, air toxic compounds, and ozone precursors required to be measured by the Photochemical Assessment Monitoring Stations (PAMS) program. A principal objective of EPA=s monitoring and quality assurance role is to ensure that the quality of the data collected and reported by state/local/tribal agencies, federal agencies, and other parties, can be quantified and can be used to support programs such as the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), the federal reference and equivalency program, and the nation=s air quality management programs. Solid technical support is critical to the U.S. EPA=s ability to support air quality management policies and programs, as this support will directly impact federal, state, and local air quality monitoring activities. The efficient use of air quality data to obtain useful and defensible environmental protection results is also an important concern for EPA.  The development and application of statistical techniques to meet this need involves areas, such as trends analysis, data screening, risk assessment, model performance evaluation, and comparisons with respect to the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).  Key considerations in the successful implementation of these techniques are not limited simply to the validity of the statistical assumptions, but must address the feasibility of employing the technique, the practicality of implementation and how the underlying statistical framework relates to existing methodologies.  In some cases, it may be necessary to develop and assemble alternative environmental indicators to help explain air quality trends and to reconcile these trends with emissions, modeling, health, and ecological information. The Contractor shall provide support for the U.S. EPA=s ambient air monitoring and quality assurance programs including, but not limited to, the associated federal regulations and policies, outreach activities, technical guidance, field activities, special studies,  program and quality system development, statistical support, desktop publishing support, web site design and operation and data retrievals.  The contractor shall provide the necessary labor, material, facilities, and expertise required for the performance of the following tasks:  Task 1. General Technical Support; Task 2. Development and Revision of Guidance Documents and Technical Reports; Task 3. Facilitate Assessments and Audits; Task 4. Outreach Activities; Task 5. Conference, Seminars, and Workshops; Task 6. Cost Estimates;  Task 7. Completion of Special Air Quality Studies; Task 8.  Data Quality Objective (DQO) Development and Program Support;  Task 9. Regulatory Support; Task 10. Statistical Support; Task 11. Desktop Publishing Support; Task 12. Precision and Accuracy Program; Task 13. Data Retrievals.   The total duration of the proposed contract is sixty (60) months.  The government anticipates the award of a cost plus fixed fee, level of effort type contract with a base period of performance of twelve (12) months, with four (4) additional twelve (12) month option periods.  The contract will be awarded on the basis of full and open competition and will consist of 10,000 base quantity labor hours and 65,000 optional quantity labor hours for each of the five (5) periods, for a total contract maximum of 375,000 labor hours. The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541620  with a size standard of 6.5 million.  The anticipated contract award date is October 1, 2007.   This effort is not a follow-on effort.  The solicitation is scheduled to be issued on or around May 14, 2007 and proposals will be due thirty (30) calendar days after the RFP issuance date.  A draft copy of COI clauses (I don?t have an electronic copy of the draft COI clauses to post with this synopsis) to be included in the solicitation can be found at http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd. The solicitation and amendments will be available at http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd    If you obtain a copy of the solicitation via internet, it will be your responsibility to frequently check the same site where the solicitation is posted for any amendments. The Government is not obligated or committed to award any contract as a result of this notice.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 336120   In accordance with FAR Part 12 Commercial Items and FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures, the U.S. EPA National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (Ann Arbor, Michigan) requires a 2007 Dodge Ram 2500 SLT Quad Cab 4X4 Diesel Truck.  This diesel truck is specifically required because it is the only diesel truck in the marketplace that currently meets the EPA Heavy Duty 2010 engine and chassis standards.  This truck needs to be delivered by the end of May, 2007, so EPA can research the need for adding Supplemental Federal Testing Procedures (SFTP)  to the certification requirements for Heavy Duty vehicles.  This specific Dodge Ram Truck is the first to be certified under the chassis provision of the Heavy Duty standard.  As such, it was certified using only the Federal Testing Procedure 75 (FTP 75) and not the other SFTP cycles that all Light  Duty (LD) vehicles are required to use.  This vehicle will be used to establish the need for SFTP and will provide critical input to a new standard that needs to be approved by the end of 2007.  Due to the amount of testing and analysis that needs to be conducted, vehicle delivery after the end of  May jeopardizes establishment of SFTP for industry.  Due to the research intent of the vehicle, a GSA waiver is not required.     This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, in conjunction with FAR 13.5, and as  supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is RFQ-OH-07-00101 and is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). The  solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-16.   For this solicitation, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency intends to conduct an online competitive reverse auction to be facilitated by a third-party reverse  auction provider, FedBid, Inc.  FedBid has developed an online, anonymous, browser based application to conduct the reverse auction. An Offeror may submit a series of pricing quotes, which descend in price during the specified period of time for the aforementioned reverse auction. The U.S. EPA is  taking this action in an effort to improve vendor access and awareness of requests while expediting its ability to gather multiple, completed, real-time offers. All responsible Offerors that respond to this solicitation MUST submit the pricing portion of their offer using the online exchange  located at www.FedBid.com. There is no cost to register, review procurement data or make an offer on www.FedBid.com.

<DESC>The Air Force District of Washington Acquisition Division intends to award a Firm Fixed Price effort to Indoor Environmental Services, Inc. (IES), located at 2450 Lower Marlboro Rd, Owings, MD 20736, a small business concern, to provide carpet cleaning service to the National Military Command Center (NMCC) located in the Pentagon.  Period of performance is May and September of 2007.

The NMCC supports the Secretary of Defense (SECDEF) and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS).  This agency receives numerous visits from high ranking domestic and foreign visitors requiring that the facility?s appearance must remain at a high standard.  In order to support this, the NMCC must clean the carpet on the raised flooring system and still be able to maintain its mission.  IES is, currently, the only known carpet cleaning service that provides restorative low moisture shampoo that cleans the carpet and protects the adhesive on the raised floor tiles.  The procedure that IES uses to clean carpeted areas will be dry within 30 minutes and can be walked on immediately, preventing personnel from having to relocate to another work area during the time the carpet is being cleaned. Currently, IES is the only capable source found that can satisfy this agency's need.  The NAICS Code and the small business size standards for this award are 561740 and $4.5M, respectively.

The award will be made on or about 01 May 2007.  No telephone inquiries will be accepted.

<DESC>Facility Operation and Maintenance (O&M) Services for Memphis Internal Revenue Service Center.   Request for Quotation (RFQ) No. TIRSE-04-Q-00016, dated 09/02/2004, was issued soliciting Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) contractors.  It is the governments intent to award a combination firm-fixed-priced/time-and-materials type task order to the successful FSS contractor offering the best value to the government.   The task order will consist of a base period ending 9/30/2005 and four 12-month option renewal periods.  The task order will consist primarily of FSS priced services that are contained within one or more of the successful contractors special item numbers (SIN) awarded by General Service Administration under FSS No. 03FAC.  It is anticipated that a small portion of the contractors firm-fixed-price may consist of open market items necessary to fulfill the governments complete O&M service requirement outlined in the RFQ.  It is also anticipated that a portion of the time-and-material priced services (related services to be ordered on an as-needed basis) may result in some open market items being procured during the course of the order period.   Open market items may include such costs as subcontract and/or other direct costs not included in the successful contractors FSS award.  The government intends to award a task order, and include any open market items if applicable, to that FSS contractor offering the best value, without seeking any further competition.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

NO RECONDITIONED ITEMS ARE ACCEPTABLE.<BR><BR>This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the acquisition of Dell PowerEdge 2900 Server.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements and the Bureau of Consular Affairs systems environment and visa generation requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another manufacturer or company.CA/CST has identified the Dell PowerEdge 2900 server equipped with more recent and powerful dual-core Intel Xeon 5150 processors for their superior performance and lower power consumption as the only server that can successfully function as a primary Oracle server (POS) for Consular Affairs overseas systems.  The PowerEdge 2900 server is the ninth generation PowerEdge server manufactured by Dell. The server is equipped with Intel Xeon 5100 series processors, which can help lower power consumption and can deliver up to a 152 percent increase in performance over the previous generation dual-socket Dell PowerEdge servers. The server uses dual core processor technology, combining two processing units into a single processor chip. This technology increases performance and efficient use of power, especially when running several applications on a single server.  Consular Affairs modernized applications rely on the availability and operability of a POS installed at every post where the applications are used.   The POS must function as a primary server, a standby, an external drive and a backup.  This is considered a critical piece of equipment. For support purposes, we must standardize on one configuration.  The Dell 2900 meets all requirements. In summation, CA/CST believes that the Departments best interests will be served if the Dell PowerEdge 2900 is procured at this time.  No other server fully meets the Departments requirements.  The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.<BR><BR>As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements. The product fulfills the following requirements: 	The server must meet the Consular Affairs minimum hardware requirements for Primary Oracle servers. 	The server must be configurable as a Primary Oracle server, according to the Consular Affairs Systems Administration Manual. 	The server must pass the POS-to-SOS failover test. 	The server must pass the SOS-to-POS failback test. The Dell PowerEdge 2900 is the best choice for a primary Oracle server for use by Consular Affairs in the deployment and maintenance of Consular Affairs database servers worldwide. Other cost-effective choices for primary Oracle servers exist, but currently only Dell offers the latest dual core technology, which combines two processing units into a single processor chip. Oracle is able to make use of multiple processors, which allows the application to quickly load and transition between processes. This new technology should provide increased performance and efficiency, as compared to using only one processor. Furthermore, using the same HW manufacturer for the POS and SOS will allow cost savings because the drives will be interchangeable. Standby Oracle servers provide access to Oracle services in the event of a POS failure. The SOS provides a secondary platform that a post can use when the POS suffers an unforeseen hardware or software failure.  Under normal operations, the POS maintains all the Oracle database tables and data a post needs to perform consular functions and sends interval updates to the SOS. These updates are stored on the external hard drive attached to the POS, which stores all changes to the database between replication periods in the form of redo logs. This process assists in overall data integrity.  When a post suffers a POS hardware failure that cannot be recovered in a reasonable timeframe, the post is instructed to use the SOS for all Oracle services.  The SOS is then turned off, and the external devices that are connected to the POS are connected to the SOS. Once the SOS is turned on, these devices populate the database with the most current entries made after the replication period. This process allows for total data integrity.  Once the POS is repaired, it must be configured as if it were the SOS. The post must then establish replication between the new POS and the new SOS so that an eventual migration back to the primary server can be performed.  After the POS has received all updates, the SOS must be disconnected from the network, and changed back to the original configuration. The POS must also be changed back to the original configuration and turned off. The external devices must then be moved back to the POS for data recovery. Once rebooted, the Bureaus Data Engineering Task Team will apply the appropriate scripts to restore the database.<BR><BR>The Dell server equipment was selected for this purpose because results obtained by the Bureaus Systems Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturers servers indicated that it most closely met the Department of States throughput, processing and redundancy requirements. It has been approved by the Bureau of Consular Affairs Configuration Control Board and is being added to the Consular HW Baseline.<BR><BR>

<DESC>This amendment answers an additional question concerning this solicitation.  See Amendment 02 for answers to Questions 1 & 2.

QUESTIONS---

QUESTION 3--- Monopoles come with foot pegs and a climber safety
restraint system instead of a ladder and ladder cage. Typically, these types of poles are not constructed with ladders and cages anymore because of the past difficulties in manufacturing.  Will you consider a foot peg and safety restraint configuration rather than the ladder and cage configuration?
ANSWER 3--- Due to the nature of this requirement the Government needs monopoles with ladders and safety cages.  Therefore, the Item Description, as originally stated, remains unchanged.

<DESC>The Global Systems Positioning Wing will post the final Request for Proposal number FA8807-06-R-0001 for the GPS IIIA Space Vehicle to the GPS Bidder?s Library on 07 May 2007.  The Navstar GPS is a satellite-based radio navigation system that serves military and civil users worldwide. GPS IIIA will maintain constellation sustainment, provide existing capabilities, plus introduction of a new L1C civil signal, increased earth coverage M-code power for authorized military users, a graceful growth path to achieve full CDD threshold requirements, and continuing support for the NDS mission, to serve the evolving needs of GPS military and civil users.  GPS IIIA is an Acquisition Category 1D program.  The GPS must comply with 10 United States Code (USC) 2281 that requires that the Secretary of Defense ensure the continued sustainment and operation of GPS for military and civilian purposes and 42 USC 14712 and comply with certain standards and facilitates international cooperation.  This acquisition effort executes these statutory mandates.

BIDDERS LIBRARY:  
The RFP and attachments can be found under Bidders-Block III at https://gps.losangeles.af.mil/gpslibrary/.  

The DoD recently mandated the Public Key infrastructure (PKI) requiring all DoD restricted web sites and web-based applications to verify users via digital identification certificates, rather than via a username and password, before granting access. 

In order to access the Bidder's Library and view the GPS IIIA RFP or any of the afore mentioned systems, each contractor must have the following PKI components: 

(a) A DoD Common Access Card (CAC) with a valid PKI certificate, along with a CAC reader and software, or 
(b) A DoD-approved External Certification Authority (ECA) certificate (http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/index.html). 

This process may take up to 8 days to complete and there is a nominal fee. 
OMBUDSMAN:  An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from potential offerors.

<SUBJECT>A -- Conduct Second Follow-up of Patients Enrolled in the Combining Medications and Behavioral Interventions (COMBINE) Study
<SOLNBR>NIAAA-07-07

<CONTACT>Patricia Hanacek, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-594-6226, Fax 301-443-3891, Email hanacekp@mail.nih.gov
<DESC>THIS MODIFICATION REPLACES THE PREVIOUS NOTE 22 SYNOPSIS.  IT REVISES THE GOVERNMENT'S INTENT TO INCLUDE SUBJECTS FROM A SECOND STUDY NOT PREVIOUSLY INCLUDED IN THE FIRST NOTE 22 SYNOPSIS.  



The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the Research Triangle Institute (RTI) to conduct a follow-up study of subjects who were previously enrolled in a multi-site randomized clinical trial (RCT):  Combined Pharmacotherapies and Behavioral Interventions ("COMBINE") and subjects in the current medications trial: A Phase 2, Double-blind, Placebo Controlled Trial to Assess the Efficacy of Quetiapine Fumarate Sustained Release for the Treatment of Alcohol Dependency in Very Heavy Drinkers (the "Quetiapine Study").  RTI is the one responsible source that can satisfy the Agency's requirement because (1) RTI is the sole owner of critical previously collected data on human subjects in the COMBINE study, (2) has extensive experience necessary to conduct the study proposed for the current contract; and (3) no other source can supply the services and data that will satisfy agency requirements for the follow-on work for this study.

Development of the original COMBINE study was initiated in 1998 and supported by NIAAA under a co-operative agreement.  Data collection was begun in 2001.  In COMBINE, 1383 subjects were randomized to medications: one, both or neither (placebo) naltrexone or acamprosate combined.  In addition to the medication subjects were assigned to either (a) a 16-week behavioral therapy or (b) no behavioral therapy.  Eleven recruitment/ treatment sites and one co-coordinating center participated in COMBINE.  Extensive information was collected on subjects, including data from numerous questionnaires over several time points, tissue samples and genetic analyses.  Staff from the Research Triangle Institute (RTI) participated in development of data collection instruments.
 
A 5-year grant for a follow-up study ("Cost Effectiveness of Alcohol Treatment") was awarded to RTI in 2002.  Eight hundred thirty-five subjects and 9 of the 11 original study sites participated in this, the first COMBINE follow-up study.  Follow-up data but no treatments were administered under this study.  A series of in-person interviews were conducted at the 9 participating sites.  Data collection for this study will conclude in the fall of 2006.  Most participants at the 9 sites provided informed consent to (a) be interviewed and (b) have their data from the COMBINE study, with identifiers, linked to data collected under the first-follow-up study.  Under the grant mechanism, these data belong to the grantee, RTI.  In addition to these data, the study maintained records of subject location information and one or two personal contacts useful for tracing subjects who moved and/or changed phone numbers.  

For cost and efficiency purposes, NIAAA plans to conduct the current follow-up study using a single contractor (RTI) and telephone interviews.  The contractor will help design and gain Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval of the study.  Confidential contact information, some already maintained through the RTI grant, will be used to track currently-enrolled subjects.  Subjects will be provided with details of the new follow-up study and asked to provide informed consent for the new study.  Four half-hour telephone interviews, planned at yearly intervals, will be administered to consenting subjects.  Development of the interviews will be done by personnel familiar with the COMBINE and first follow-up instruments.  As in the first follow-up study, subjects will be asked for their consent to link the data from COMBINE and the first follow-up studies with the current follow-up study, or from the Quetiapine Study with the current study.  These procedures require that the contractor have access to confidential identifiers and other data.  

Substantial data (including participants' confidentially provided data and list of contacts) which is required to conduct the current study is owned by RTI.  Furthermore, participants' confidential information may not be passed on to another research organization without prior consent of each participant.  As RTI has the unique resources to provide the particular research services proposed, a sole source contract to RTI is the only means to conduct the current follow-up phase as described.  

Pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 6.302-1, the Research Triangle Institute is the only source capable of performing this requirement due their ownership of the data and prerequisite knowledge and experience because of their work under the Cooperative Agreement and performing as the grantee for the COMBINE study under the NIAAA Grant.   

To begin anew with a different source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that would not be recovered through competition as well as unacceptable delays in obtaining the required data.   

Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements as described above.  A determination not to compete the proposed work based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.  This notice of intent is not an announcement of the availability of a Request for Proposal, nor is an RFP available.  See Numbered Note 22.

Burkina Faso: National ICT Backbone Network Feasibility Study.  The Grantee, the Government of Burkina Faso (GoBF), acting through le Ministere des Postes et des Technologies de l?Information et de la Communication (Ministry of Posts and ICT), invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study to implement a National ICT Backbone Network.  The Ministry of Posts and ICT is responsible for the development and implementation of the ICT policy.  In addition, the Ministry is responsible for the postal service.  

The feasibility study will focus on assessing the technical, legal and financial viability of implementing the National ICT Backbone Network in Burkina Faso that will ultimately connect it with neighboring countries.  Burkina Faso is a landlocked country bordered by Mali, Niger, Benin, Togo, Ghana and Cote D?Ivoire. Several of these countries could serve as connection points to undersea fiber optic cable (i.e. Benin, Ghana); others could utilize Burkina Faso as an access point to those cables (e.g. Niger, Mali); and several could provide for regional connectivity (e.g. Togo). 

Specifically, the Terms of Reference for this project include:

1)  Background Research
2)  Requirements Analysis 
3)  Technical Network Design, Equipment Specifications, and Project Costs
4)  Business and Management Implementation Scenarios 
5)  Regulatory and Legal Framework
6)  Project Financing
7)  Environmental Impact Assessment 
8)  Development Impact Assessment 
9)  Final Report 

If the Project is implemented, it would provide high speed broadband connectivity, reaching currently underserved populations and significantly reducing the current prohibitive cost of telephony and Internet services in Burkina Faso. 

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $350,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

1)  Background Research
2)  Requirements Analysis 
3)  Technical Network Design, Equipment Specifications, and Project Costs
4)  Business and Management Implementation Scenarios 
5)  Regulatory and Legal Framework
6)  Project Financing
7)  Environmental Impact Assessment 
8)  Development Impact Assessment 
9)  Final Report 

If the Project is implemented, it would provide high speed broadband connectivity, reaching currently underserved populations and significantly reducing the current prohibitive cost of telephony and Internet services in Burkina Faso. 

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $350,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization, in conjunction with the National Cancer Institute (NCI), is hosting its first outreach event aimed at bringing together representatives from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Minority Institutions (MIs), 8(a), HUBZone, and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses for networking and partnering opportunities.

The goals for this event are to: (1) build relationships with HBCUs, MIs, 8(a)?s, HUBZones, and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses in order to pursue partnerships in Government subcontracting; (2) provide technical knowledge in Government subcontracting and cost analysis training; and (3) provide information on contract opportunities.

This one-day event will consist of presentations by key speakers within the acquisition community who will provide examples of requirements/announcements, methods on how to respond to announcements, and resources on where related information can be found. Participants will also be given the opportunity to have one-on-one discussions with NCI program staff and representatives from companies that currently hold large contracts with the NCI. This provides a real opportunity to obtain advice on Federal subcontracting opportunities.

Two representatives from your organization are invited to attend. Limited seating is available. You will be responsible for covering the cost of your travel to this event.

If you would like to attend this event, please submit your name and full contact information via e-mail to Ms. Michelle Murray at michellem@novaresearch.com. There is no registration fee to attend this event.

<DESC>RFP W911W4-07-R-0002 has been released on FedTeDS (www.fedteds.gov). The closing date and time is 1:00 P.M. (1300) Eastern Time on 22 May 2007.  Multiple awards of an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) are anticipated for IT services to support the Futures Directorate Technology Insertion Program.  The number of  prime contracts to be awarded will be determined based upon the Governments evaluation of submitted offers.  A best-value source selection process will be conducted.  Areas evaluated will be management, sample task order(s), past performance, security and  cost.  Security and cost will not be weighted.  The evaluated cost and fee of the CPAF sample task order(s), with option years, will be used in the trade-off selection process.  Also, the sample task order(s) may be issued as task order(s) contemporaneous ly with the basic IDIQ award.  All awards except one are reserved for small business.  The NAICS code applicable to this procurement is 541512, Computer Systems Design Services, with a $23.0M size standard.  The goal for task orders awarded to small busine ss will be 50% of the value of all orders issued.  In the event that percentage is not maintained, competition on future task orders will be set-aside for small business prime contractors until that percentage is attained.  The ordering period for issuance  of task orders will be 5 years.  IDIQ prime contractors will be provided fair opportunity for award of task orders for task areas they were considered capable based upon the Governments evaluation of their response to this solicitation.  Task Orders may contain options for continued performance.  In no event would performance under one Task Order exceed a 1 year base period plus 4 one year option periods.

<DESC>THIS SERVES AS THE FULL SOURCES SOUGHT NOTIFICATION.  PLEASE IGNORE THE REFERENCE TO AN ATTACHMENT IN THE ORIGINAL POSTING. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT. THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS ONLY. The purpose of this sources sought notice is to gauge the level of interest and capability within the contracting community for conducting environmental restoration work at th e Redstone Arsenal (RSA) under an incentivized contract structure that utilizes the prime contractor in the role of a Program Management Contractor (PMC).  Response to this notice is strictly voluntary and will not affect any corporations ability to submi t an offer if and when a solicitation is released.  There is no bid package or solicitation document associated with this announcement.    Statement of Objectives: The Government anticipates a requirement where the objective will be to achieve Remedy in Place (RIP) or Response Complete (RC) at all Installation Restoration Program (IRP) sites at the Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama, on or before September 30, 2 014, while ensuring that the cleanup also supports the needs of the Installations operational mission.  The goal of the Army is to achieve this objective cost effectively, while maintaining a high level of both quality and safety, and meeting all regulato ry and Army requirements.  The Army is seeking a performance-based, best value solution. The anticipated NAICS code is 562910 (Environmental Remediation Services).  Installation Description and Anticipated Scope of Activities: RSA is an operating installation with more than 70 tenants.  It is designated as a gaining installation under the BRAC 2005 realignment; as such, significant importance will be placed on a contractors ability to work with and around mission support activi ties and willingness to be flexible in their restoration activity schedules if and when mission needs warrant a change to the scheduled activities.   Restoration activities are conducted under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Lia bility Act (CERCLA), as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA), and National Oil and Hazardous Substances Contingency Plan (NCP) requirements. Work is also conducted pursuant to Resource Conservation Recovery Act (RCRA) through the State RCRA Part B Corrective Action permit.  Regulatory coordination is with both the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Region 4.  RSA is on the National Priorities List (NPL); as such, a tri-party Federal Facilities Agreement (FFA) is currently being drafted and is anticipated for signature prior to release of a solicitation.   The Contractor must have the demonstrated capability and experience to integrate and manage a large diverse environmental restoration program, and to perform, or provide, a wide range of investigative, remedial design, remedial construction, and remediatio n services required for hazardous substance and waste sites, munitions and explosives of concern (MEC), and chemical warfare materiel (CWM). Work will include, for example, site investigation, site characterization, evaluation of remedial alternatives, dev elopment of remedial action objectives and exit strategies, remedial design, remedial construction, remediation of contaminated sites, remedial action (operations), and long-term management (LTM). It is the Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations and to fulfill the performance objectives of this proposed requirement in a manner that is consistent with any applicable orders or permits, a ll existing and future cleanup agreements or guidance, and relevant Department of Defense (DoD) and Army policy for the Installation, for the duration of the contract.   The activities required to achieve the objective of RIP/RC for the IRP sites at RSA will include conducting r equired environmental restoration services for which the United States Department of the Army (the 'Army') is statutorily responsible; addressing any and all unforeseen environmental, scheduling, and regulatory issues; and, assuming contractual liability a nd responsibility for the achievement of the performance objectives for the cleanup sites, including any sites with off-installation contamination for which the Army is responsible.  Contractors should note that 'Unforeseen environmental issues' include un known and/or varied concentrations of contaminants at cleanup sites (off-installation areas included) to be identified in the Performance Work Statement (PWS), but not unknown sites (e.g., sites not identified in the PWS).   Activities required on Military  Munitions Response Program (MMRP) sites are likely.  In addition, this scope may include a number of compliance cleanup sites.   Because of the nature of on-going mission, contractors working on specific high priority sites will need active security clear ances.    Information on the RSA environmental program is available on the public website, http://www.garrison.redstone.army.mil/sites/directorates/dpw/emd/res/emd_res.html and at the USAEC website, http://aec.army.mil/usaec/cleanup/index.html.  Corporate Capabilities / Statement of Interest: For this anticipated requirement, the Army plans to seek an experienced program management contractor capable of integrating all activities necessary to complete the work described, within the required schedule.   The Army anticipates restricting the selec ted PMC Contractors activities to management/integration activities with a requirement  that all field-related work be subcontracted, with a minimum of 50% of the subcontracted work being awarded to small business.  The  Contractor would be responsible fo r providing the strategic planning and integration necessary to identify necessary activities, developing and managing the overall schedule, developing appropriate performance-based scoping documents, competing the work efforts among multiple subcontractor s, and overseeing/managing work performed by others to ensure achievement of the Armys performance objectives.   1.) Contractors are encouraged to submit a capabilities statement describing corporate experience in managing requirements similar in size and scope to the activities described above.  This capabilities statement should not exceed 10 pages in length and sh ould focus on successful recent (within the past 5 years) and relevant past performance to this anticipated scope.  Specific areas of interest to the government include the following: "	Demonstrated ability to manage and work on performance-based acquisitions. "	Demonstrated ability to conduct and oversee all aspects of technical and administrative work described above, on contracts that exceed $100 million in value.  "	Demonstrated experience of a proven management team to integrate multiple subcontractors, and achieve aggressive small business goals (it is anticipated that there will be a 50% small business requirement) under contracts exceeding $100 million in value. "	Demonstrated experience working on large, active federal installations. "	Demonstrated use of an earned value management system to control cost and schedule performance as well as report progress against contracts. In addition to the 10-page capability statement, contractors are encouraged to submit thoughts on overall contract structure, including incentives and fee construct, period of performance, ability of the prime contractor to self perform (and the types of a ctivities considered appropriate for the prime contractor to self perform), etc.   Please include the following with your response: "	Name and address of firm "	Size of business "	Point of contact and telephone. 2.) Interested small businesses are encouraged to submit a capabilities statement describing corporate experience in performing environmental r emediation requirements. This information will assist the Army in identifying potential subcontracting set-asides to small businesses. This capabilities statement should not exceed 5 pages in length and should focus on successful recent (within the past 5 years) remediation experience.  Please include the following with your response: "	Name and address of firm "	Size of business "	Point of contact and telephone. Industry Day(s):  The Government anticipates conducting industry day(s) at RSA. Details will be provided at a later date. Submission Instruction: Please e-mail your responses to Lane M. Gary at lane.gary@us.army.mil no later than4 May 2007 at Noon EST.   Since this is a sources sought to be used in planning a future acquisition, do not send any proposals.

NO RECONDITIONED ITEMS ARE ACCEPTABLE.<BR><BR>This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of the Fujitsu FI-4340C Document Scanner and the Fujitsu FI-5220C Document Scanner.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of the Fujitsu FI-4340C Document Scanner and the Fujitsu FI-5220C Document Scanner.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.CA/CST requires the Fujitsu FI-4340C document scanner and the Fujitsu FI-5220C document scanner to support Consular posts overseas.  The Fujitsu FI-4340C and Fujitsu FI-5220C are a high-speed color capable scanner with top speed of 40 sheets per minute or 80 (when scanning both sides of each sheet) page images per minute.   The document scanners operates at approximately twice the speed of the previously reviewed FI-4220C.  The product complies and is able to operate within Consular Affairs (CA) Modernized Systems architecture.  This scanner meets specific requirements for CA Non-Immigrant Visa (NIV) applications.  It is also suitable for use with other CA applications.   In summation, CA/CST believes that it is in the best interests of the Government to acquire the requested Fujitsu FI-4340C document scanner and the Fujitsu FI-5220C document scanner without delay.   The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.<BR><BR>As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system. The choice to use the Fujitsu FI-4340C document scanner and the Fujitsu FI-5220C document scanner as opposed to other document scanners available is that CA/CST/CS has acquired and fielded several hundred of these scanners since its inception in 2002.  The Fujitsu FI-4340C and the Fujitsu FI-5220C offer more features and is more robust than other scanners in this price range.  The continued use of Fujitsu scanners obviates the need to procure, maintain and account for spare parts inventories for multiple scanners.  Furthermore, no additional training to those handling the scanner is necessary with the continued use of this scanner.   In addition, the document scanners require customized software.  Because the proprietary Consular applications (NIV, IVO, ACS+, and INK) have been developed to work with this specific document scanner, it is most cost effective to continue to use the Fujitsu FI-4340C and the Fujitsu FI-5220C scanners rather than introduce another manufacturers product.  Another manufacturers product will require redesigning the CA applications.   CA/CST has selected the Fujitsu FI-4340C and the Fujitsu FI-5220C document scanners because results obtain by the Bureaus System Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturers scanners indicated that this scanner most closely met the DoS processing, redundancy, and management requirements.   The Fujitsu FI-4340C and the Fujitsu FI-5220C document scanners has been evaluated and approved by the Bureau of Consular Affairs Configuration Control Board and has been added to the Consular HW Baseline.  The scanners have undergone test and assessment and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board.<BR><BR>

NO RECONDITIONED ITEMS ARE ACCEPTABLE.<BR><BR>This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the acquisition of Dell PowerEdge 2900 Server.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements and the Bureau of Consular Affairs systems environment and visa generation requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another manufacturer or company.CA/CST has identified the Dell PowerEdge 2900 server equipped with more recent and powerful dual-core Intel Xeon 5150 processors for their superior performance and lower power consumption as the only server that can successfully function as a primary Oracle server (POS) for Consular Affairs overseas systems.  The PowerEdge 2900 server is the ninth generation PowerEdge server manufactured by Dell. The server is equipped with Intel Xeon 5100 series processors, which can help lower power consumption and can deliver up to a 152 percent increase in performance over the previous generation dual-socket Dell PowerEdge servers. The server uses dual core processor technology, combining two processing units into a single processor chip. This technology increases performance and efficient use of power, especially when running several applications on a single server.  Consular Affairs modernized applications rely on the availability and operability of a POS installed at every post where the applications are used.   The POS must function as a primary server, a standby, an external drive and a backup.  This is considered a critical piece of equipment. For support purposes, we must standardize on one configuration.  The Dell 2900 meets all requirements. In summation, CA/CST believes that the Departments best interests will be served if the Dell PowerEdge 2900 is procured at this time.  No other server fully meets the Departments requirements.  The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.<BR><BR>As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements. The product fulfills the following requirements: 	The server must meet the Consular Affairs minimum hardware requirements for Primary Oracle servers. 	The server must be configurable as a Primary Oracle server, according to the Consular Affairs Systems Administration Manual. 	The server must pass the POS-to-SOS failover test. 	The server must pass the SOS-to-POS failback test. The Dell PowerEdge 2900 is the best choice for a primary Oracle server for use by Consular Affairs in the deployment and maintenance of Consular Affairs database servers worldwide. Other cost-effective choices for primary Oracle servers exist, but currently only Dell offers the latest dual core technology, which combines two processing units into a single processor chip. Oracle is able to make use of multiple processors, which allows the application to quickly load and transition between processes. This new technology should provide increased performance and efficiency, as compared to using only one processor. Furthermore, using the same HW manufacturer for the POS and SOS will allow cost savings because the drives will be interchangeable. Standby Oracle servers provide access to Oracle services in the event of a POS failure. The SOS provides a secondary platform that a post can use when the POS suffers an unforeseen hardware or software failure.  Under normal operations, the POS maintains all the Oracle database tables and data a post needs to perform consular functions and sends interval updates to the SOS. These updates are stored on the external hard drive attached to the POS, which stores all changes to the database between replication periods in the form of redo logs. This process assists in overall data integrity.  When a post suffers a POS hardware failure that cannot be recovered in a reasonable timeframe, the post is instructed to use the SOS for all Oracle services.  The SOS is then turned off, and the external devices that are connected to the POS are connected to the SOS. Once the SOS is turned on, these devices populate the database with the most current entries made after the replication period. This process allows for total data integrity.  Once the POS is repaired, it must be configured as if it were the SOS. The post must then establish replication between the new POS and the new SOS so that an eventual migration back to the primary server can be performed.  After the POS has received all updates, the SOS must be disconnected from the network, and changed back to the original configuration. The POS must also be changed back to the original configuration and turned off. The external devices must then be moved back to the POS for data recovery. Once rebooted, the Bureaus Data Engineering Task Team will apply the appropriate scripts to restore the database.<BR><BR>The Dell server equipment was selected for this purpose because results obtained by the Bureaus Systems Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturers servers indicated that it most closely met the Department of States throughput, processing and redundancy requirements. It has been approved by the Bureau of Consular Affairs Configuration Control Board and is being added to the Consular HW Baseline.<BR><BR>

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of the Quantum SDLT 320 Tape Drive.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State 	SDLT technology roadmap offers future capacities beyond 1TB per cartridgeinfrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.Digital Linear Tape (DLT) is one of several technologies developed to increase data transfer rates and storage capacities of computer tape drives. SDLT, an upgraded variant of DLT technology, makes it possible to store more than 100 GB on a single cartridge with data transfer speeds of up to 10 MB per second.  SDLT drives are currently deployed to posts.    The SDLT 160/320 is the second tape drive released in the SDLT family, offering a 45% increase in native storage capacity and performance as compared to the SDLT 110/220 GB tape drive. With its improvements in capacity and performance, the SDLT 160/320 GB tape drive is positioned as the fastest and highest capacity tape drive in the mid-range drive segment. Backward read compatible with DLT Type IV media, the SDLT 160/320 maintains the SDLT compatibility standards introduced on the SDLT 110/220 while adding read compatibility for media written in the DLT1 and DLT VS 40/80 format. SDLT 160/320 GB Tape Drive Customer benefits include: 	160 GB per cartridge capacity requires fewer data cartridges for backups, reducing the customers total cost of ownership 	57.6 GB/hour performance reduces the customers backup window by 33% or more as compared to other competitive technologies 	Investment protection through backward-read compatibility with previously written DLT Type IV and SDLT media 	Increased reliability and performance through technological advances in drive head and media design 	Reduces dependence on spares inventory with a 24-hour exchange<BR><BR>The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system. CA/CST has selected the Quantum SDLT 320 GB Tape Drive because results obtain by the Bureaus System Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturers tape drives indicated that this is the only tape drive that meets the DoSs processing, redundancy, and management requirements.  The requested SDLT tape drives will be deployed at overseas posts which has established an environment comprised of equipment that is compatible with the Quantum SDLT 320 tape drive.  The continued use of the SDLT tape drive eliminates the need to procure, maintain, and account for spare part inventories for multiple HW manufacturers server configurations. Most importantly, the Quantum SDLT 320 GB Drive is currently the only tape drive available that meets CAs requirements. In summation, CA/CST believes that it is in the best interests of the Government to acquire the requested Quantum SDLT 320 Tape Drive without delay.<BR><BR>

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of the APC 120V Smart UPS.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.CA/CST requires the APC 120V Smart UPS for use as a key component for the IV&V server room.  The APC brand name is required because it is the only UPS that responds to and follows the commands of PowerChute, the software that Consular Affairs uses to generate start-up and shut-down scripts.  These scripts ensure that the database is protected. In summation, CA/CST believes that it is in the best interests of the Government to acquire the requested APC 120V Smart UPS without delay so that the pilot testing required for the verification of field functionality can commence as scheduled.   The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system.The APC 120V Smart UPS has undergone test and assessment, evaluation for overseas deployments and received final approval from the Department of State Consular Affairs Configuration Control Board.<BR><BR>This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the purchase of a Cisco 2960 Switch, Cisco 2721 Router, Cisco Catalyst 3750, and Cisco GBIC modules, which will form a switch and router solution for IV&V.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. The Cisco Catalyst 2960 24 port switch is a fixed-configuration switch that provides wire-speed Fast Ethernet and Gigabit Ethernet connectivity for small and medium-sized networks. The switch provides 24 10/100-Mbps ports for edge connectivity, enhanced security, high availability, and advanced quality of service. The Bureaus Systems Engineering Task Team was tasked with evaluating the Cisco Catalyst 2960 24 port switch.  Systems Engineering determined that the product fulfilled the following requirements: 	The switch must provide wire speeds of 10/100 GB. 	The switch must provide reliable connectivity between the eDV Web servers and database servers. 	The switch must be able to provide port density for the domain controllers and monitoring servers. The 41 USC 253(c)(1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments networking system. The current CISCO switches and router has not previously had any problems; however, the aging switches have been in service for about 6-7 years now and have not been replaced.  Hardware may start failing soon and it is in CAs best interest to be ready to replace the Cisco switches with new switches right away. It could take days to replace a CISCO component, which could potentially mean unnecessary downtime.  The main reason for the equipment; however, is to expand the network. With the amount of systems that CA has, CA is rapidly running out of ports on the network and is preparing for future needs.  Cisco Systems is a leading network appliance manufacturer and has a proven industry record for robustness, reliability, and functionality. Cisco appliances have been implemented in private and government sectors, including DOD and intelligence agencies.<BR><BR>Cisco Systems has comprehensive and rigid testing criteria for their certified engineers. They have continually increased the number of qualified engineers who support their products worldwide. The Cisco Catalyst 2960 24 port switch has been, and continues to be, a key component in many network architecture implementations and deployments. This is due to the success of the Cisco Catalyst 2960 24 port switch in providing network performance, reliability, expandability, functionality, connectivity, and security, as well as minimizing the vulnerability of network systems in Internet, intranet, and extranet solutions. The Cisco equipment was selected for this purpose because results obtained by the Bureaus Systems Engineering Task Team in tests and reviews of other manufacturers servers indicated that it most closely met the Department of States throughput, processing and redundancy requirements. It has been approved by the Bureau of Consular Affairs Configuration Control Board and is being added to the Consular HW Baseline.<BR><BR>A) Sellers must bid exact match to spec (make, model and spec)  B)The products offered in this bid are brand new, not gray market and are in original packaging. C)  Seller is providing these products via Cisco authorized channels for new equipment Federal sales.  D) Full Cisco warranties will be provided and none of these products will have a negative impact on the warranties of associated system components.<BR><BR>

<CONTACT>A Kay Steffey, Contract Specialist, Phone 907-747-4273, Fax 907-747-4289, Email ksteffey@fs.fed.us
<DESC>Scope of Objectives<br>
Provide technical assistance for the development of updated descriptive statistics for aquatic habitat parameters.<br>
<br>
Introduction:  Watershed Analyses on the Tongass National Forest make frequent use of natural ranges of variation for select stream attributes published in Bryant 2004.  An expansion of the original dataset allows us the opportunity to repeat these analyses and provide updated statistics.  Additionally a recent publication by Woodsmith (2005) offers additional metrics that can be efficiently analyzed during this effort.<br>
<br>
This scope of work covers the statistical analysis of a set of aquatic data.  The contractor should be proficient with statistical software programs, statistical methodologies, analysis of ecological data and time-series analysis.<br>
<br>
The contractor will do the following:<br>
<br>
1) Provide updated statistical tables for eight aquatic habitat measures published in Bryant 2004.  Provide the same type of statistical tables for three additional habitat measures listed Woodsmiths 2005 publication.<br>  
<br>
2) Provide statistics and graphs describing variation of the above measures through time (wherever the data allows).<br>  
<br>
3) Explore different types of stream segments stratifications.  Use those stratifications that are most effective for decoupling human-caused and natural changes to the above measures.<br>
<br>
Deliverables are: 1) An updated statistical table for the eight originally published aquatic habitat parameters plus the three selected variables from Woodsmith (2005).<br>
<br>
2) A written description of the methodologies involved in the calculations.<br>  
<br>
3) Written recommendations about the future of this dataset from a statistical perspective.<br>  
<br>
Milestones: Begin work March 27, 2007; review progress after 2 weeks on April 8, 2007 Project completed by May 1, 2007.<br>

Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southeast (NAVFACSE) is seeking U. S. Small Business Administration (SBA) sources with current relevant qualifications, experience, personnel, security approvals, equipment, and capability to perform the two proposed projects at Naval Submarine Base, Kings Bay, Georgia. The proposed projects are P-596 WO511912 Reaction Force Facility Auxiliary Support Complex and P-598 WO511913 Waterfront Security Force Facility.  

P-596 is to construct a 40,788 SF Security Complex on diverse sites across Naval Submarine Base (NSB), Kings Bay GA, including an Auxiliary Reaction Force Facility (ARFF), an Armored Fighting Vehicle Operational Storage Facility (AFVOSF), an Armory, a Small Arms Magazine (SOM), and other facilities to support auxiliary security forces responding to incidents in the Strategic Weapons Facility Atlantic (SWFLANT) Limited Area and NSB Kings Bay GA Waterfront Restricted Area (WRA). The ARFF will support an 80-man security force per shift; three (3) shifts a day, and include secure-parking for six Armored Fighting Vehicles (AFV). The ARFF will be a single-story, ballistic-hardened, reinforced concrete structure. The roof will be capable of supporting fighting positions and defensive weapon mounts. The ARFF will be surrounded by a fence with security lighting, gates, and vehicle barriers. The ARFF includes fire detection, fire suppression, communication, electrical, plumbing, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems, and a food preparation and serving area.  Site improvements include parking, sidewalks, access roads and paving. Force protection measures include perimeter protection, standoff zones, gates, and vehicle barriers. Built-in equipment will include complete galley equipment and ventilation equipment for the alert vehicle garage. The SOM is an earth covered, multi-cell box type magazine with reinforced concrete walls, roof and floor and is not required to be environmentally controlled. The AFVOSF will be a reinforced concrete structure for the ready storage of 30 AFVs. The facility will have mechanical ventilation, lighting, and reaction force access/egress on all building sides. The Armory will be a single-story bullet resistant reinforced concrete structure, including built-in racks for weapons storage, ready ammunition storage lockers, a weapons issue area, a weapons repair area with de-greasing and weapons cleaning tanks, an outside covered pad for weapons cleaning, and will be environmentally controlled. The estimated cost range is between $10,836,000.00 and $12,040,000.00. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 236220 with a Small Business Size Standard of $31.0 million.  

P-598 is to construct a Waterfront Security Force Facility (WSFF) within the NSB Kings Bay GA Waterfront Restricted Area (WRA). This project constructs a two-story WSFF to support an 80-man security force per shift; three shifts a day, and provides secure parking for six (6) Armored Fighting Vehicles (AFV). The facility will have pile foundations and concrete floor slab, concrete exterior walls, and a reinforced concrete roof. Built-in equipment will include complete galley equipment outfitting and ventilation equipment for the AFV garage. Special construction features include pile foundation, seismic reinforcement, and strengthening the roof to allow installation of fighting positions and automatic weapons mounts. The access roads will be improved to provide shorter response times. The roadway improvements will result in the loss of 150 waterfront parking spaces, which will be replaced by this project. Environmental mitigation requires replanting and replacing habitat areas lost during construction. The estimated cost range is between $5,200,200.00 and $5,778,000.00.  The NAICS Code is 236220 with a Small Business Size Standard of $31.0 million.  

Interested sources are invited to respond to this sources sought announcement by providing the following information. Submit a maximum of five (5) projects describing the following: 1) Past Experience: Describe projects completed in the last three (3) years that are similar in size, scope, and complexity.

<SUBJECT>65 -- Tricare Heartland Medical Material Standardization for Head and Shoe Covers
<SOLNBR>R5-04-23-07-058-HSC
<RESPDATE>051407
<ARCHDATE>05142007
<CONTACT>Phyllis Targett, Clinical Analyst IV, Phone 937-257-9075, Fax 937-656-1157, Email phyllis.targett@wpafb.af.mil - Phyllis Targett, Clinical Analyst IV, Phone 937-257-9075, Fax 937-656-1157, Email phyllis.targett@wpafb.af.mil
<DESC>A.	 General Information

     The Heartland Region, TRBO Region 5, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 5 Army, Navy, and Air Force, medical treatment facilities in Ohio, Illinois, and Kentucky announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Head and Shoe Covers. The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to achieve a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program. 
  The major facilities in the area include but are not limited to Wright Patterson Air Force Base Ohio, Scott Air Force Base Illinois, Naval Health Clinics of Great Lakes Illinois, Blanchfield Army Community Hospital Ft Campbell Kentucky, and Ireland Army Community Hospital Ft Knox Kentucky.

     This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products. This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCP?s Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil

The TRBO will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage/forecasted requirements. The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods. Anticipated award date is June 2007. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The award will be determined utilizing Best value/ trade off criteria.    
   
Point of Contact Phyllis Targett 937-257-9075 phyllis.targett@wpafb.af.mil

B.	Products & Performance Required

The Heartland Region is seeking product line items in the category of Head and Shoe Covers. The estimated total volume for this region for this product line is $24,791. This is based on historical prime vendor sales for a 12-month period. 

At the request of the Heartland Region Military Treatment Facilities vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products offered by the vendor.

C.	Instructions to Offerors

DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to phyllis.targett@wpafb.af.mil (937)257-9075 before 4:00 P.M. EST
This process will include vendor requirements of electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price offers. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  Vendors that fail to meet the submittal deadline will be disqualified.

D.	 Evaluation Criteria

The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities within the Heartland Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative.
Phase I. Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB to determine acceptability.  After review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet the criteria will be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation. All technical criteria are equally weighted.
Phase II. The TPRB will request samples from the product group to be non- clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities. Vendors are required to ship samples direct to the MTFs. A three-week period will be allotted to vendors for shipment. Samples must be received by COB at 4PM local time, 21 calendar days after request. Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.
The MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a Likert-like one to five rating scale where one is equal to not acceptable and five is equal to highly acceptable. All criteria are weighted equally. The TPRB has set a 3.75 acceptability threshold for all product groups. Clinical/performance results lower than 3.75 will not be considered acceptable and will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process. 

Phase III. After the clinical/performance evaluation are completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the 3.75 threshold will be asked to submit their best pricing offer based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Heartland Region. Vendors who fail to offer discounted prices will be disqualified from RIA award consideration.
Clinical/performance factors will be weighted more heavily than price. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year base period with the option to extend for one or two-years (not to exceed 5 years). Vendors that fail to offer an incentive discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  
  

1. Technical/Company Criteria Evaluation

The TPRB will review the following technical criteria responses from each vendor and determine acceptability. Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria: Generally responses to all questions in this section demonstrate that: 1) the business concern offering the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; 2) based on the quoter?s responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services offered meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; 3) the quoter has, or is obtaining a DAPA for the items; 4) the quoter has, or is obtaining, a distribution agreement covering the items with the Prime Vendor for the region; and 5) the quoter intends to offer discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to offer a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and 6) the quoter?s information provided is factually correct (any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.)

<DESC>Request for Information on
Serious Games Initiative for Transportation Security Officer Training

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  Additionally, the Government WILL NOT provide reimbursement for any information that may be submitted in response to this RFI.  Responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  The results of this RFI will be used in the development of the final Request for Proposal, and will be used in narrowing the field of potential offerors to which the final RFP will be sent.

This is a Request for Information (RFI) on a Serious Games Initiative for the Transportation Security Administration to introduce a new, innovative training style for training Transportation Security Officers (TSOs).  The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) plays a critical role in safeguarding our nations transportation infrastructure in general and the security of the flying public in particular.  Poorly performed screener functions can have far reaching catastrophic results.  Therefore, it is essential to meet the challenge of maintaining the Transportation Security Officer (TSO) workforce at peak operational readiness, amidst rapidly changing circumstances. To that end, TSO training must be continual and ongoing, and therefore engaging to keep the learning community motivated.  

The Operational and Technical Training Group within TSA is introducing a new, innovative training style at TSA to enhance and transform its portfolio of TSO Training methodologies. This will include a Serious Games approach that can be a valuable tool to motivate the screener community to learn and perform at optimal levels.  The objective of this approach/initiative is to analyze, design, prototype, produce, deliver, and sustain a Serious Games training curriculum to satisfy the training needs and performance requirements of TSOs at TSA.  The TSO serious game initiative should meet the following high level objectives:  

sound pedagogy; 
leverage (where possible) commercial and TSA developed products; and
present realistic challenges and scenarios.

The purpose of this RFI is to: (1) gather ideas as to whether the attached draft Statement of Objectives (SOO) encompasses all aspects needed to design, produce, and deliver a serious game for training of TSOs; (2) identify potential bidders based on the submitted capability statements; and (3) finalize the acquisition strategy for the serious game initiative.

Responses to this RFI shall include:
 
Company name, address, point of contact, telephone/fax number, and email address;
Indication of business size status (such as disadvantaged, 8(a), HUB Zone, Woman Owned, Minority Owned, and/or Veteran Owned);
A capability statement (including number of years providing representative serious gaming methodologies); 
Comments on the draft SOO and approach; 
High level ROM estimate to complete Tasks 4.1.1 through 4.1.3 in the SOO; and 
a suggested timeline and milestones for the effort.  

Submissions are restricted to no more than ten (10) pages in length.

Offerors in their capability statement should describe at a minimum their expertise and experience in developing and implementing serious gaming techniques.  

All information in response to this RFI shall be submitted no later than 5 P.M. Eastern Standard Time, May 7, 2007 to the following email addresses: 

Deldridge.berry@associates.dhs.gov and
Sandra.mclaughlin@dhs.gov

Please note that the collection of this data does not obligate the Government to the incorporation of the solicited comments nor does it obligate the Government to the procurement of the services.  TSA thanks all respondents for their comments and inputs.

<DESC>This is a sources sought announcement for binocular helmet mounted night vision goggle systems for evaluation. 

This is the first phase of a possible two stage procurement.  In this first stage, the systems offered to the government in response to this announcement shall be provided through a no cost loan agreement, the content of which is at the end of this announcement.  The offeror must complete the vendor loan agreement and submit it along with their product as described herein and documentation sufficient to prove their capability and capacity to produce and deliver to the Government up to 10,000 night vision goggle systems.

The requested night vision goggle systems must be equipped to provide the user with direct view image intensifier tubes and must provide the user with performance that meets or exceeds currently issued PVS-23 and PVS-15A night vision goggles.  The goggle system must be compatible with both the Aviators Night Vision Imaging System (ANVIS) style ball detent mounting bracket (e.g., PVS-23 mount) and the Wilcox dovetail mounting bracket (e.g., PVS-15A mount).  This compatibility may be achieved through the use of interchangeable mounting brackets on the night vision goggle assembly.  The systems requested shall have unity magnification with a minimum field of view of 40 degrees (circular) and shall be compatible with the Modular/Integrated Communications Helmet (MICH).  

These systems submitted under the no cost loan shall be evaluated in an operationally relevant scenario, i.e., outdoors with representative deployed forces.  This fact requires the systems to be sufficiently rugged and durable to withstand the unique challenges of a combat environment and remain operational.  Certain combat environment challenges the night vision goggle systems must be able to withstand, be protected against, and remain operational during are sand, dust, and rain.  Additionally, the systems must capable of withstanding submersion in water to a depth of 66 ft.  

A simulated operational evaluation of all offerors? helmet mounted night vision goggle systems will be conducted and the results of the evaluation will be used as past performance if the decision is made to pursue phase 2.  Offerors can refer to  MIL STD 810F (1 JAN 2000) details on the simulated operation environment, at a minimum the following will be evaluated in accordance with MIL STD 810F sections which are provided as a reference.

1.	High Temperature:  REF 501 Procedures I and II

2.	Required temperatures:	 Operational 60 C, Storage 71 C
3.	Low Temperature:	REF 502 Procedures I and II
4.	Required Temperatures:	 Operational -31 C, Storage -33 C
5.	Altitude:  		REF 500 Procedures I and II
6.	Humidity: 		REF 507 Procedure I
7.	Shock:			REF 516 Procedures I and IV
8.	Vibration:		REF 514 Procedures I and II
9.	Immersion:		REF 512 Procedure I
                     a.		depth requirement is 66 Feet

10.	Sand and Dust:		Procedures I and III



Each offeror shall provide a minimum of three (3), or up to a maximum of 20 (higher quantities preferred), night vision goggle systems for evaluation under a signed vendor loan agreement provided at the end of this announcement.  The provided systems will be evaluated based upon the following criteria:

1.  Operational Effectiveness
2.  Field of View 
3.  Weight 
4.  Overall Size 
5.  Power Requirements

The weightings in terms of importance of the above evaluation criteria are as follows:
1-Operational Effectiveness is the most important criteria and is significantly more important than 2-Field of View.  
2-Field of View is of equal importance as 3-Weight.
3-Weight is more important that 4-Overall Size.  
4-Overall Size and 5-Power Requirements are of equal importance.  
  
The duration for evaluating the night vision goggle systems will be approximately 90 days.  Upon evaluation completion, the units will be returned with an evaluation form providing feedback to the offeror.  

If funding is still available a request for proposal shall be released for Phase 2 in the FEDBIZ Opps.  Contractors will be requested to submit proposals for a replacement for both the Passive Vision System-23 (PVS-23) and the PVS-15A night vision goggle systems over an anticipated 5 year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract with a Minimum of 300 PER Year to a Maximum of 1500 per year every year for five years.  The evaluation factors are envisioned to be past performance, mission capability (as identified in the first stage above 1-5), proposal risk, cost price.  Past performance, specifically the performance shown during evaluation of the systems submitted under the no cost loan, shall weigh significantly in the evaluation of the proposals.

Accordingly, it has been found desirable, in receiving voluntary submissions for evaluation, to exercise such precaution as will preclude misunderstanding by the submitter and prevent such submissions from having any restrictive or limiting effect on the Government's improvement programs.

 2.  It should be understood that acceptance for test or evaluation for potential usefulness to USSOCOM does not apply a promise to pay, a recognition of novelty, originality or uniqueness, or a contractual relationship such as would render the Government liable to pay for the use of the voluntary submission; and, in no way does any action under this Agreement obligate the Government to procure experimental, production or other quantities of the article submitted or the item covered by the disclosure.  The submitter will not file any claim against USSOCOM or otherwise seek compensation for any information or services provided.

 3.  Due care will be exercised in the handling and testing of voluntary submissions.  The 
     Government will, however, assume no responsibility or liability to submitter or others 
     for:

 a.  Damage to, destruction of, or loss of voluntary submissions resulting from testing 
 activities or otherwise.

     b.  Damage or injuries due to negligence or other causes which are incurred or 
     suffered by submitter, submitter employees, or invitees during any test of such article
     or disclosure which is under the control of the submitter, his authorized agents, 
     or employees whether or not USSOCOM personnel are participating in the test.

 4.  The manufacture, transportation and maintenance of articles submitted to the Government for evaluation or testing will be accomplished without cost to the Government.

 5.  Submitter may furnish instructions to the Government concerning the disposal of voluntary submissions, provided such instructions are furnished prior to completion of the tests or evaluation.  Absent any such instructions, the Government will dispose of such property in accordance with established procedures.

 6.  The voluntary submissions will be handled in accordance with established Government procedures for safeguarding such articles or information against unauthorized disclosure.  In addition, data forming a part of or constituting the submission will not be disclosed outside the Government or be duplicated, used, or disclosed in whole or part by the USSOCOM for any purpose other than to evaluate the proposal.  This restriction does not limit the Government's right to use information contained in such data if it is obtained from another source, or is in the public domain.  Liability by any reason or unauthorized disclosure of the submission by the Government will under no circumstances extend beyond the actual damage to the submitter caused by acts of the Government and cognizable in law. Furthermore, the Government accepts no liability for failure to safeguard information unless the information consists of a patentable invention, copyrighted, material, or data constituting a trade secret.  Proposals, without restrictive markings, received from educational or nonprofit organizations may be evaluated outside the Government provided that the evaluators agree in writing not to reproduce, use, or disclose the information in whole or part, except for the purpose or evaluation, without the written permission from the submitter.

 7.  Unsolicited articles or disclosures are submitted and received in accordance with Agreement notwithstanding any contrary or inconsistent conditions imprinted on or submitted together with such articles or disclosures, or orally expressed.

 8.  Informal information covering the results of evaluations or tests will be furnished to submitter upon request. Such information shall not be construed as an endorsement b the Government or articles or the subject matter of disclosures nor shall they be used in whole or in part for advertising purposes with industry or other Government agencies.

 9.  The terms of the Policy Agreement shall apply to all submitted articles and disclosures.  The provisions of any contract for procurement resulting from these disclosures will supersede this understanding.

10.  The USSOCOM technical point of contact will maintain status of the equipment or 
       material.  Responsibilities shall be limited by the policies within this agreement.

<DESC><B>Request for Information / Market Research</B>
<P>
<P>
The Social Security Administration (SSA) is conducting market research to identify contractor sources capable of providing expert, independent, and objective advisory and assistance services (as defined at FAR 2.101) in support of the SSA's Office of Systems/Office of Telecommunications Systems. The SSA's market research seeks to identify entities capable of providing totally unbiased advisory and assistance services on an enterprise-wide basis in highly complex technical, management, professional disciplines. Specific examples of the types of expert advisory and assistance services of interest to the SSA are:
<P>
<B>Strategic Technology Planning and Evaluation Support Services</B> 
<P>- Provide guidance on the evolution of major systems architectures and the adoption of new technologies. 
<P>- Provide support for establishing enterprise technology policies and architectural direction to achieve strategic technology best value.
<P>- Perform industry analyses through research, investigation of best practices and product and price benchmarks.
<P>- Provide expert technical advice, assistance, and support for evaluating appropriate existing and/or emerging technologies, products, and services; consider the long-term and broad range needs of the government; develop prototypes and conduct proof of concept feasibility studies.
<P>- Conduct independent review and testing of acquired technologies to ensure the technical quality and programmatic suitability of delivered systems and products.
<P>
<P>
<B>Technology Program Management Support Services</B>
<P>- Provide project management support to Program Offices in the deployment and management operations of new technologies.
<P>- Provide analyses and assistance in the identification and management of risk in existing technological environments as well as risks associated with the adoption of new technologies and/or processes.
<P>- Provide support in coordinating resources and project management activities between multiple governmental and private sector stakeholder groups.
<P>
<P>
<B>Business Support Services</B>
<P>- Perform analyses and research in support of the acquisition of advanced technologies and services. Support development of specifications and procurement documents such as Statements of Work (SOW), Independent Government Cost Estimates, Source Selection Plans, and evaluation criteria and methodologies.
<P>- Provide support in creating business case documents such as alternatives analyses, cost modeling and projections analyses, and cost/ benefit analyses.
<P>
<P> 
The advisory and assistance services described herein involve high-level Agency strategic planning and very significant capital investments; therefore, it is vital to the SSA that these services be provided completely free of any and all real or apparent biases, and with great discretion. Real or apparent biases include those related to any products, solutions or organizations. Performance of these services would require the disclosure of highly sensitive government and industry proprietary information to an advisory and assistance services contractor. Public or intra-company release of such information would undermine SSA's ability to work effectively with the vendor community and also would undermine the integrity of current and future procurements. Due to the nature of the work described an advisory and assistance services contractor would not be eligible to participate in any commercial enterprises directly related to the items or services studied. Any party selected to perform these services on behalf of the Social Security Administration would be subject to a pre-contract vetting process and would be required to sign the SSA?s confidentiality and conflict of interest certifications.  
<P>
<P>
Interested parties with the capabilities and corporate characteristics to provide the advisory and assistance services described herein are invited to reply to this notice. All replies must include information detailing the interested party's capabilities and prior history of performing services of a similar nature, size, scope, and complexity to those described. Respondents shall also provide information on their corporate structure, and must be able to demonstrate an historical and ongoing commitment to providing expert, bias-free advisory and assistance services.
<P>
<P>
Information supplied in reply to this notice will be used solely for market research purposes to assist the SSA in creation of a possible future procurement strategy. This notice does not constitute a solicitation for proposals. Information supplied in reply to this notice will not constitute a proposal or an offer for services. No information submitted in reply to this notice will be returned to the supplier. Information submitted in reply to this notice shall be provided at no cost to the Government.  Information submitted in reply to this notice shall be provided in electronic format to the following e-mail address: <U>Randall.Pickwell@ssa.gov</U> no later than May 9, 2007.

<SUBJECT>B -- Intent to Sole Souce UCLA Center for Health Policy Research
<DESC>DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT:

ON BEHALF OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, CENTER FOR QUALITY IMPROVEMENT AND PATIENT SAFETY, AGENCY FOR HEALTHCARE RESEARCH AND QUALITY (AHRQ), THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, PROGRAM SUPPORT CENTER PLANS TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION TO UCLA CENTER FOR HEALTH POLICY RESEARCH, 10960 WILSHIRE BOULEVARD, SUITE 1550, LOS ANGELES, CA  90024. THE PURPOSE IS TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE HEALTHCARE RESEARCH AND QUALITY ACT OF 1999. THIS INCLUDES PROVIDING AN ANNUAL REPORT TO CONGRESS REGARDING PREVAILING DISPARITIES IN HEALTHCARE DELIVERY AS IT RELATES TO RACIAL FACTORS AND SOCIOECONOMIC FACTORS IN PRIORITY POPULATIONS. TO HELP FILL THESE GAPS AND INCLUDE SOME INFORMATION ABOUT THESE PRIORITY POPULATIONS IN NHDR, AHRQ STAFF EXAMINED A NUMBER OF STATE HEALTHCARE DATATBASES. THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH INTERVIEW SURVEY (CHIS) WAS IDENTIFIED AS THE ONLY STATE HEALTHCARE DATABASE THAT HAS THE CAPACITY TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT MANY OF THESE POPULATIONS. THE CONTRACTOR SHALL PROVIDE SUPPORTING RESEARCH AND ANALYSIS REGARDING HEALTHCARE DISPARITIES HISTORICALLY NOT DOCUMENTED ON PRIORITY POPULATIONS.

TO WRITE THE 2003 NATIONAL HEALTHCARE DISPARITIES REPORT (NHDR), AHRQ STAFF EXAMINED A VARIETY OF NATIONAL HEALTHCARE DATABASES. WHILE NATIONAL DATABASES CAN MEASURE DISPARITIES AMONG MOST PRIORITY POPULATIONS, A NUMBER OF EXCEPTIONS ARE NOTED. SPECIFICALLY, NATIONAL DATABASES ARE NOT DESIGNED TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT PACIFIC ISLANDERS, AMERICAN INDIAN AND ALASKA NATIVES, ASIAN SUBPOPULATIONS, AND MANY HISPANC SUBPOPULATIONS WITH DESIRED PRECISION. IN ADDITION, AMONG POPULATIONS THAT ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY, NATIONAL DATABASES ARE GENERALLY UNABLE TO DISTINGUISH INDIVIDUALS WITH AND WITHOUT LANGUAGE BARRIERS.

THE 2001 CHIS DATA WAS INCLUDED IN THE 2003 NATIONAL HEALTHCARE DISPARITIES REPORT. CHIS CONTINUES TO BE A RELIABLE SOURCE OF HEALTHCARE DATA FOR PACIFIC ISLANDERS, AMERICAN INDIAN AND ALASKA NATIVES, ASIAN SUBPOPULATIONS, AND MANY HISPANC SUBPOPULATIONS WITH LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY AND NOW HAS AN ADDITIONAL TWO YEARS OF DATA AVAILABLE. THE 2007 NHDR WILL UPDATE THE PREVIOUSLY USED DATA TO INCLUDE THE 2003 AND 2005 CHIS DATA AND CONSIDER RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ADDITIONAL MEASURES AND ANAYSES THAT ARE APPROPRIATE FOR THE NHDR. THE 2007 NHDR WILL USE THE CHIS DATA TO SHOW MEASURES AND ANALYSES THAT ARE APPROPRIATE FOR THE NHDR. THE 2007 NHDR WILL USE THE CHIS DATA TO SHOW TRENDS OF HEALTHCARE QUALITY AND DISPARITIES FOR THE RACIAL AND ETHNIC SUBPOPULATIONS FROM 2001-2005. 


THE PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION ACTION IS FOR SERVICES FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO NEGOTIATE, UNDER FAR PART 12, WITH ONLY ONE SOURCE. BECAUSE THE ANALYSIS OF CHIS DATA WILL NECESSARILY INCLUDE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION THAT IS EXCLUDED FROM THE CHIS PUBLIC-USE FILES, THE DATA MUST BE ANALYZED IN THE UCLA CENTER FOR HEALTH POLICY RESEARCH'S DATA. DUE TO THIS RESTRICTION, THE UCLA CENTER FOR HEALTH POLICY RESEARCH IS THE SOLE SOURCE IN PROVIDING THIS INFORMATION.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, PLEASE CONTACT KELLY LAEL IN ROOM 5-101, PARKLAWN BUILDING, 5600 FISHERS LANE, ROCKVILLE, MD  20857 OR AT (301) 443-7078.

<SUBJECT>U -- MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN FLYING COMPUTER BASED TRAINING PROGRAM
<DESC>Under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Part 6, Subparts 6.301 and 6.302, the U.S. Forest Service intends to contract with Canadian Helicopters School of Advanced Flight Training on a sole source basis to provide an interagency "flight in mountainous terrain" training syllabus that address the elements typically encountered by pilots performing U.S. Forest Service mountainous terrain missions.  The training syllabus will contain individual modules that include tutorials, graphics, video demonstrations (as necessary), and module tests.  The syllabus will also include a comprehensive test consisting of approximately 100 test questions that will address the entire training program.  Pilots will be required to access and successfully complete all modules and pass the comprehensive test in order to establish eligibility for an interagency pilot approval to conduct operations in mountainous terrain.  Canadian Helicopters School of Advanced Flight Training is dedicated primarily to the training of flight in mountainous terrain and are recognized throughout the helicopter industry for this type of training.  Canadian Helicopters is also contracted annually by Helicopter Association International (HAI) to conduct Flight in Mountainous Terrain familiarization training (classroom) as a part of the educational series sponsored by HAI at their annual convention.  Canadian Helicopter also provides ground and flight training to the U.S. Army, the U.S. Marine Corp., the Canadian Army, various European military organizations, and numerous civil operators.  Canadian Helicopter's proven expertise and their recognition by both the Armed Services and the helicopter industry are key factors that support this sole source acquisition.  Due to the highly complex and specialized nature of this training syllabus, the developer must have in-depth knowledge and proven experience in the areas of flight in mountainous terrain, incident flying, and pilot training and certification.  The estimated value of this sole source acquisition is $60,000.

<SUBJECT>A -- Multilingual Automatic Document Classification Analysis and Translation (MADCAT) Industry Day
<DESC>The United States has a compelling need for reliable information affecting military command, soldiers in the field, and national security.  Currently, our warfighters encounter foreign language images in many forms, including, but not limited to graffiti, road signs, printed media, and captured records in the form of paper and computer files.  Given the quantity of foreign language material, it is difficult to interpret the salient pieces of information, much of which is either ignored or analyzed too late to be of any use.

DARPA seeks strong, responsive proposals from well-qualified sources for a new language technology program called Multilingual Automatic Document Classification Analysis and Translation (MADCAT).  The goal of this program is to automatically convert foreign language text images into English transcripts, thus eliminating the need for linguists and analysts while automatically providing relevant, distilled actionable information to military command and personnel in a timely fashion.  The MADCAT BAA will be available to the public shortly.  There will be an Industry Day held on May 1, 2007.  Details are on the Industry Day registration site.

<DESC>The Brunswick Job Corps Center is solicting sources to bid on the following renovation, drainage and ventilation projects. Bid packages will be available at the mandatory pre-bid construction meeting on May 24, 2007.  

(Renovation Project)

Damaged concrete beams:				
Repair the concrete beams supporting the concrete deck on the north and south side of Wing C that are damaged as well as the under side of the deck on both levels at the entry to Wing D. Areas of the surface have spalled. Repair the deteriorated concrete beams and deck. Chip off damaged surface material to a minimum depth of 1?. Sandblast or chemically clean exposed surfaces. Using a non-shrink, non-metallic epoxy grout, fill the areas and finish to match existing (approximately 15sf). Seal the top of the lower deck such that water can?t seep into the voids and cause more spalling. Anchor a 3x5 (LLH) angle to the wall directly against the underside of the lower level.

Cafeteria water damage:				
Repair recurrent visible, as well as concealed, dry-rot and water damage that is evident at the north wall of the kitchen preparation area. Deterioration is due to previous roof leaks. Remove all dry-rotted and water damaged areas on all sides of the wall including fiberglass panels, plaster and wood studs. Rebuild the wall using metal studs and water resistant GWB. Finish with new FRP panels. Coordinate work with all incidental items such as plumbing pipes, electrical conduits and outlets, etc. The wall is approximate 40? long, 6? thick and 12? high. 

Wing C southeast exterior stair nosing:			
Repair the exterior concrete stairs that have deteriorated and the concrete treads and risers at the nosing have broken off in several locations and can be a tripping hazard for students and staff. Repair damaged nosing by removing all loose concrete material and chipping the concrete nosing a minimum 3? beyond the damaged edge on both sides to provide a secure area for the bonding of new epoxy cement nosing. Clean all rust particles from all exposed reinforcing bars and treat all exposed areas to riser to match the existing stair and patch the damaged area with exposed cement according to manufacturer?s specifications and recommendations. The length of damaged nosing to be repaired is approximated 60 linear feet. 

Gymnasium interior lighting:					
Repair the recorded foot-candle level in the gymnasium that is 65% below the DOL/IES recommended illumination level. The existing number of the light fixtures is inadequate. Provide twenty additional High Intensity Discharge (HID) fixtures with 150 watt lamps and high efficiency reflectors. Install the new lighting fixtures between the existing lighting fixtures to provide a well-distributed illumination. Provide two new lighting branch circuits to the nearest panel and provide an updated panel directory to indicate the new circuits. Install 20-150w, HID with high efficiency reflectors light fixtures, 2-20 Ampere single pole circuit breakers, 500 lf, #12 THHW, 150-lf ?? EMT conduit.

(Drainage Projects)

Storm water drainage vocational buildings:			
Storm water runoff ponds around the Vocation Buildings 26 and 27 and could potentially cause damage to the concrete slab on grade and foundations. Re-grade the area around the vocation buildings to create a positive slope to divert the storm runoff away from the buildings and discharge into the existing swale. Re-grade re-seed and dress existing swale. Estimated area to be graded is 3,500 SF and the estimated length of swale is 150 lf. 

Site storm water drainage:				
The drainage swale located at the north side of the main building and the drainage swales in front of the female dormitory and along the physical fitness center are in poor condition and fail to function due to the accumulation of silt.  Clean out the drainage swales, re-grade and re-seed. Remove and replace all rip rap in the swale by the female dormitory. Create a new swale from the physical fitness center to the existing swale along the property line. Total length of all drainage swales is estimated to be around 1,100 lf. 
   
(Ventilation Projects)
VST storage area ventilation:					
Repair the VST storage area which includes eight rooms that are not provided with any ventilation. The rooms are used to store a variety of items as decided by the center, including gasoline-powered lawn mowers, furniture, paint, etc. Provide two (2) wall louver/dampers (12?x12?) in each of the eight (8) VST storage rooms. These louver/dampers will allow exchange between inside and outside air. (Total: 16-12?x12? louver/dampers). Mount on the exterior walls.

Male 1 Dorm 1st and 2nd Floor Bathroom ventilation:	
Repair existing roof-mounted exhaust fans the serves both the central toilet room on the 1st floor and the central toilet on the 2nd floor to Wing D male dormitory. This existing fan lacks the capacity to provide adequate exhaust ventilation in both toilet areas. Retain the existing roof-mounted exhaust fan to serve only the 2nd floor toilet. Remove the 1st floor duct connection and cap the opening air-tight. Provide a new all-mounted exhaust fan (600 CFM) to serve the 1st floor toilet only. Provide electrical connections, fan switch and approximately 20lf or 12?x10? galvanized steel duct. 

Main building ventilation					
Repair air-locked return plenums and obstructed or non-existent return air paths, prevent return airflow to all 18 air handling units in eight mechanical rooms. This air circulation problem prevents delivery of the required amount of fresh air to the occupied rooms. An additional consequence of the circulation problem is the build-up of high temperatures in classrooms, dormitory rooms in wings A, B, C, and D along with other areas, causing discomfort and disruption of activities. The pneumatic-based automatic temperature control system is non-functional. This system controls the HVAC throughout the building (AHUs, thermostats, chilled and hot water valves, air dampers, etc). Provide design-build contractor services to provide a means of return airflow from the rooms in the building to the return air inlet of the AHU that serves such rooms. Portions of the return air path already exist in the form of registers, grilles, plenums, ductwork, and wall openings. Some of these items might have been partially or totally altered over time by building renovations, new walls and partitions, disconnected ducts, closed fire-dampers, etc. Provide ductwork, diffusers and registers for adequate ventilation. After the return airflow is established at each AHU, verify that the return air duct-mounted smoke detector functions and actually stops the AHU and initiates the building alarm when smoke is detected in the return air stream. Provide air and water (chilled and hot) balance throughout the building. Provide design-build contractor services to rehabilitate the existing pneumatic-based automatic temperature control system throughout the building. Replace any missing or damaged control system components and devices. Provide thermostats for each air handling system. Classrooms and dormitory air systems should have return air thermostats. Certain rooms in Building 1 have inadequate ventilation since they are not provided with return air, exhaust air or fresh air. Provide return air grilles and return air ductwork in the following rooms. The ducts are to be connected to the nearest existing return air ducts. Also, provide air balance as required for the new air distribution: (1) Wing B (east), first floor: computer server room; male dorm toilet room north of the auditorium (add one more return air register and associated return duct). (2) Wing B (west), first floor:  Learning Resource Center, TEAP room, Career room. (3) Wing C, first floor: electrical classroom, vocational office (secretary) ? 2 rooms, facility maintenance ? 2 rooms (one of these rooms has only supply air but no return air. Second room has neither supply nor return air. Therefore, install both return and supply air ducts for second room), facility maintenance storage, Center Standards office, Group Life (Residential Living) ? 3 rooms. (4) Wing C, second floor: manager?s office in the kitchen area, banquet room ? registers, GED room (This room has no supply air. Install the supply air register and duct in addition to the return air), writing and critical thinking room, and academic meeting room. (5) In addition, relocate the existing 24?x24? registers (2) and add two more registers to distribute the fresh air evenly in the conference room.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared IAW the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 and supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  Quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This is a request for quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-16 and DFARS Change Notice (DCN) 2007-03-27.  Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code is 3825 and the size standard is 500.  NAICS is 334515. 
The 412th TW at the Air Force Flight Test Center, Edwards AFB has a requirement to provide 3 foot, 4 foot, and 5 foot high radar absorbent material (RAM) low frequency test capability in the Benefield Anechoic Facility (BAF).
 NOTES: 
(1) Unless noted otherwise, all RAM dimensions below refer to nominal height, i.e.: 600 mm is close enough to 24 inches. 
(2) Unless noted otherwise, standard base dimensions required are 24 inch x 24 inch (600 mm x 600 mm may be acceptable).
(3) If your company does not currently produce the particular item requested, do not quote unless your company can deliver within 6 Months After Receipt of Order.
(4). Quotes for any product containing uncharacterized RAM coating treatment WILL NOT be considered by the Government during the selection process. 
(5) If your company produces some of the items requested, you may submit a quote for those items.
This purchase will be for 140, Each, 60 inch pyramidal absorbers; 140, Each, 48 inch pyramidal absorber; and 140, Each, 36 inch pyramidal absorber, each with a base of 24 inches by 24 inches in accordance with the following Statement of Work and specifications: 
STATEMENT OF WORK FOR 3 FOOT, 4 FOOT AND 5 FOOT MICROWAVE PYRAMIDAL FLAME-RETARDANT ABSORBERS.

1.0 SCOPE: The 772nd Test Squadron of Edwards AFB, CA has a requirement to provide low frequency test capability in the Benefield Anechoic Facility (BAF).  This low frequency capability requires the installation of large foam absorbers in order to eliminate multi-path reflections back to the System Under Test (SUT).  The purchase of 140 pieces of 60 inch pyramidal absorber, 140 pieces of 48 inch pyramidal absorber and 140 pieces of 36 inch pyramidal absorber, each with a base of 24 inches by 24 inches, is needed to provide the necessary attenuation at these frequencies.

2.0 APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS:  1) IEEE Standard 1128 ? ?Recommended Practice for RF Absorber Performance Evaluation in the Range 30 MHz to 5Ghz.?  2) NRL Report 8093 ? ?Modified Smoldering Test of Urethane Foams Used in Anechoic Chambers.?

3.0 REQUIREMENTS:

   3.1 Testing for Frequency Performance.

3.1.1 Low Frequency Testing:  Each piece of absorber shall be uniquely numbered and tested.  Low frequency testing will be performed using a coaxial reflectometer according to IEEE Standard 1128.  The IEEE low frequency method requires absorber to be tested with eight 2 foot by 2 foot pieces at a time, which is acceptable to verify the low frequency performance.  The absorber must be tested from 80 Mhz to 500 Mhz and meet or exceed the stated attenuation values.  The required break points are listed in the table below: 

	Reflectivity Attenuation in dB @ Normal Incidence
for Various Absorber Heights
Frequency (MHZ)	36 inch	48 inch	60 inch
80	N/A	15	15
120	N/A	20	20
200	N/A	30	30
300	30	35	35
500	40	40	40

Electronic and/or paper copies of the measured reflectivity data shall be delivered for each group of 8 pieces tested, indicating which serially numbered pieces were tested and whether or not they passed the reflection requirements defined in the table above.

3.1.2 High Frequency Testing:  High frequency reflectivity measurements are required for at least 10% of each sub-lot.  The frequency range required for this measurement is from 6 to 18 GHz at near normal incidence angle.  Test samples will be taken from sub-lots throughout all manufacturing runs.  Electronic and/or paper copies of the measured reflectivity data will be delivered for each set of absorber tested, indicating which serially numbered pieces were tested.

3.1.3  Data Delivery Requirements.  All data collected for low frequency and high frequency testing must be provided on or before date of absorber delivery.  The US Government will not accept any shipments of absorber which are not provided with the required associated data upon date of absorber delivery.  Each measurement plot must identify by serial number which pieces were tested for that plot.  Additionally, a table must be provided to show which serial numbers belong to which sub-lot.

   3.2 Manufacturing Constraints. 

3.2.1 Glue lines.  Due to the multi-use test nature of the BAF, glue lines are undesirable for high frequency BAF tests.  If any manufactured absorber will include any seams whatsoever, the seam location(s) must be provided and the absorber pieces with those seams must be identified by serial number.

3.2.2 Pyramid Design.  The absorber to be purchased for this SOW may be of either standard pyramid or twisted pyramid design.  In no case, however, should the manufacturer mix-and-match pyramid styles in the performance of this SOW.  All 36-inch, 48-inch and 60-inch absorber purchased under this SOW shall be of either standard pyramid or twisted pyramid design, but not both.

3.2.3 Footprint Size Tolerance.  Each piece must measure 24 inches square.  The BAF is marked with a 4 foot by 4 foot grid that has been permanently scored onto the entire concrete floor.  As such, absorber must fit onto that grid.  The absorber cannot be consistently oversized, but should instead be manufactured to a 24 inch by 24 inch base with a maximum size tolerance of +0.0 inch/-0.25 inch.

3.2.4 Cleanroom Requirement.  The absorber must not shed or leach carbon and/or fire retardants -- whether that is achieved by an inherent closed-cell design or a complete Latex-type coating over all surfaces -- including the bottom.  All absorber to be purchased as part of this SOW must not shed carbon particles during normal handling -- including dropping an upright piece of absorber from a height of 3 feet onto a concrete surface (with the bottom absorber surface impacting the concrete).  If used, the Latex-type coating on the bottom surface may be thicker than on other surfaces.

   3.3 Delivery Constraints. 
Absorber delivery must be coordinated with the 772nd Test Squadron Director of Operations (772 TS/DO). The last delivery of the entire order should not exceed 4 weeks from the first delivery.

   3.4 Fire Retardancy
Independently test the flammability of the absorber?s manufacturing method to meet the fire retardancy required by NRL Report 8093 (Tests 1, 2, and 3). 

   3.5 Physical Characteristics for Absorber.
The physical description of the 36 inch, 48 inch and 60 inch pyramidal absorber is provided in the table below:
Overall Height	36, 48 and 60 inches +/-0.5 inch
Overall Absorber Footprint	24 inches square +0.0/-0.25inch
Pyramids per piece	4 for 36 inch, 4 for 48 inch, 1 for 60 inch
Pyramid Shape	Conventional or twisted pyramid
Fire Retardancy	IAW NRL Report 8093 (Tests 1, 2 and 3)
Sealing (closed cell design or paint must  prevent the release of carbon particles)	If used, paint must be Light Blue (required on all surfaces including the bottom)
   3.6 Past Performance Requirements.
Provide evidence of previous contract success in meeting identical or similar requirements: 
a.	Absorber manufactured to similar specifications (SOW Para 3.5).
b.	Meeting flammability testing requirements IAW NRL Report 8093 (Tests 1, 2 and 3).
c.	Ability to deliver a similar quantity of absorber within the time frame specified (SOW Para 3.3).

   3.7 Program Management.
The contractor shall notify the AFFTC Contracting Officer?s Technical Representative (COTR) in a timely manner concerning any issues that would adversely impact the contractor?s ability to meet and satisfy the performance or schedule requirements of this SOW.

This growth is visible where the drywall facing the Janitors Closet has been removed.

2.	Remove and properly dispose of the mold contaminated materials with the exception of any contaminants on the drywall of the mechanical room.  The contaminants on the inside unfinished interior side of the mechanical room drywall shall be cleaned and encapsulated to ensure all contaminants are sealed according to proper environmental standards due to the limited space were mechanical equipment is immediately next to the subject wall areas.

Replace the drywall on the wall inside the Janitor?s Closet.  All new drywall shall be moisture and mold resistance type, with moisture and mold resistant cord and surfaces, core 5/8 inch, Type X.  Rusted portions of metal framing studs shall be wire brushed, primed and painted.

3.	Follow recommended containment procedures for mold remediation work in order to minimize cross contamination from the affected to unaffected areas.  This includes setting up containment barriers, consisting of 6 mil polyethylene sheeting, with negative air, to prevent cross contamination.  Provide full containment.  Isolate all HVAC air intakes.  The contractor shall provide for the health and safety of workers and occupants.  Provide engineering controls to assure safety and health of workers and building occupants, and prevent cross contamination.  This includes contamination source controls, isolation barriers, pressure differentials, dust suppression methods, HEPA vacuuming and filtration, detailed cleaning, and a sanitary approach.

4.	Inspect the drain line with a camera in the Janitors Closet to determine its condition.  Submit for review and approval the written findings and tape to the Contracting Officer?s Technical Representative.  The written findings shall include a recommended corrective action to repair any damages.  After the corrective actions have been approved, performed remaining work.  Finally, replace the mop basin as follows.  Provide floor mounted mop basin, nominal 30 inches square.  Provide for new replacement service sink faucet connected to existing hot and cold water plumbing supplies.  Provide backsplash to extend 18 inches above the basin.  Provide wall mounted mop hangers.  After repair work is complete and the mop basin is installed, a new sheet vinyl floor shall be installed in the Janitor?s Closet.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.

    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107?296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.

    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

adjustments will apply.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) for: Title: Thrust Vector Control Breadboard (BB) Circulation Motor/Pump Requirement Document Point of Contact: Thomas Kraft; thomas.g.kraft@nasa.gov; 216-433-2936 Date: 04/23/2007 Synopsis NASA, Glenn Research Center is charged with developing the Thrust Vector Control (TVC) system for the Upper-Stage of the new ARES I launch vehicle.  As part of this program we will be building a hydraulics breadboard system to evaluate the TVC hydraulic system components.  A motor driven hydraulic pump is one of the TVC hydraulic system components that will be under evaluation during this breadboard testing. The overall goal of the breadboard testing is to evaluate the functionality of each hydraulic system component (both steady state and dynamic), determine if each hydraulic component is adequately sized, and to see how all the hydraulic components operate when integrated into a complete TVC system. GRC will also use TVC hydraulic breadboard testing to help characterize the motor/pump performance under varying operating conditions.  The circulation motor/pump has two primary functions in the TVC hydraulic system.  1.	The primary function of the circulation motor/pump in the flight design will be to thermally condition the hydraulic fluid after cryogenics have been loaded on the vehicle (vehicle will be on the pad during this operation). Due to close proximity of various hydraulic system components to the cryogenic tanks, it is anticipated that the hydraulic oil will require some level of thermal conditioning (heating) prior to launch. This may require the motor/pump to operate in a cyclic on-off type of operational mode.  2.	In addition to the thermal conditioning function, the circulation motor/pump will also be used to hold the J2-X engine in the null position during the boost ascent portion (~ 135 seconds) of the vehicle flight profile. This will require the circulation motor/pump to provide a small steady amount of system leakage flow continuously at rated system pressure during this mode of operation. Motor/Pump requirements for TVC breadboard Test The general requirements applicable to the entire motor/pump assembly will be listed first followed by requirements that are specific to either the pump or the motor. General Motor/Pump Assembly Requirements: 1.	Motor/Pump Hardware Condition: Motor/pump assembly can either be a new motor/pump assembly or a re-furbished motor/pump assembly. 2.	Fluid Medium: The motor/pump shall be designed to operate with hydraulic fluid conforming to MIL-PRF-83282. If motor/pump is not designed for this fluid type then contractor shall note non-conformance. In addition, contractor shall inform NASA of the additional cost/schedule required for modifying motor/pump design to be compatible with MIL-PRF-83282 which will be subject to NASA concurrence/approval. 3.	Design:  Motor/pump shall be a fully integrated design (motor/pump is one complete package and requires no additional integration of the motor & pump by NASA GRC). 4.	Cooling Requirement: Motor/pump may be either liquid cooled (using system hydraulic working fluid) or air cooled. The method of motor/pump cooling shall be integrated into the overall motor/pump assembly. a.	If air cooled, motor/pump shall be capable of meeting or exceeding the performance requirements outlined in this document while operating in an air temperature range of 60 F to 80 F. b.	If liquid cooled, motor/pump shall be capable of meeting or exceeding the performance requirements outlined in this document while operating with hydraulic fluid that has a temperature range of -40 F to +250 F (system maximum temperature). In addition, the circulation motor/pump shall be capable of meeting or exceeding the performance requirements outlined in this document while operating with a maximum pump hydraulic fluid inlet temperature of 225 F. c.	NASA GRC would also like to have vendor give input on the type of cooling that will likely be required for eventual motor/pump flight design. NASA GRC can send vendor estimated duty cycle of motor/pump as well as other pertinent information environmental type of information if required. 5.	Interface Requirements: Contractor shall provide NASA with motor/pump interface requirements for hydraulics, electrical and for mounting of motor/pump. All interface information shall be sent to NASA GRC for concurrence/approval. a.	Electrical Connections: Industry standard electrical connections such as MIL-C-5015, MIL-DTL-38999 or equivalent are preferred. All electrical connection information shall be sent to NASA GRC for concurrence/approval. b.	Fluid Connections: SAE straight threads per MS33649 or equivalent are preferred. All fluid connection information shall be sent to NASA GRC for concurrence/approval c.	Mounting: Mounting provisions shall be supplied for motor/pump. If isolation mounts are recommended for operation then vendor shall either (1) supply vibration isolation mounts with motor/pump assembly or (2) provide required information to NASA GRC so that NASA GRC can procure vibration isolation mounts 6.	Fluid Temperature: The motor/pump shall be designed to operate within a hydraulic fluid temperature range of -40 F to +250 F in the hydraulic system. a.	The circulation motor/pump shall be capable of meeting or exceeding the performance requirements outlined in this document while operating with a maximum pump hydraulic fluid inlet temperature of 225 F. 7.	Duty Cycle/Modes of Operation: As mentioned in the synopsis, it is anticipated that the motor/pump will be required to operate in two different modes: (1) cyclic on/off mode to thermally condition the hydraulic fluid while the launch vehicle is on the pad and (2) continuous mode to hold the J-2X engine in null position during boost ascent (~ 135 seconds). Therefore, the BB motor/pump shall be capable of being cycled on/off. The number of times that the BB motor/pump will need to be cycled on/off is TBD.  The estimated minimum/maximum duration/duty cycle that the BB motor/pump will need to operate in this cyclic mode is as follows: a.	Minimum duration of cyclic mode of operation: ~ 2.5 hours @ 50 % duty cycle b.	Maximum duration of cyclic mode of operation: TBD 8.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals  are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is W912HQ-07-T-0001, which is a request for quotation (RFQ). The solicitation incorporates provision and clauses that are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circ ular 05-16. NAICS Code 541611. The period of performance is one year from date of award. The following FAR provisions apply FAR Clause 52.212.1, Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items. Additional FAR and DFAR clauses are applicable: 52.212-4, 52.212-5, 52.222-26, 52.232-33, and 252.225-7001.  Statement of Work Arrange, index, accession, and describe electronic records from USACE operations Iraq and Afghanistan. 1. Overview  The Corps of Engineers has been supporting U.S. and coalition forces in Iraq and Afghanistan since the beginning of the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT).  Over the last four years historians from the HQ USACE Office of History (CEHO) have collected nearly th ree terabytes (TB) of electronic data (henceforth the GWOT electronic data collection) related to the Corps activities in Southwest Asia in support of GWOT.  The large and disparate collection is a vital historical resource and must be arranged, indexed a nd described to enable it to be used by historians and USACE personnel. 2. Statement of Work The GWOT electronic data collection includes but is not limited to: Microsoft Word documents, PowerPoint presentations, emails with attachments, digital images in a variety of formats, and digital video. All of the material is unclassified. The material is  currently stored on CEHOs shared drive on a USACE local area network, a variety of external drives, and on compact discs and DVDs. There is currently not enough room on CEHOs shared drive to accommodate all of the material, so the contractor will have t o move data on and off the network as the project progresses.  The safety and security of the data is critically important.  The contractor will be required to make backup copies of the data at each step of the process to ensure that none is lost.     Given the large volume of records, the contractor will be responsible for providing and using a variety of document management software, augmented with manual review, to arrange, index, and search the documents.  The contractor will first make an initial s urvey of the GWOT electronic data collection and produce a brief, preliminary finding aid listing the quantity and format of the records by organization or subject.  The next step will be to select approximately 100gigabytes of GWOT data to test the proces s outlined below.  Working closely with the Contracting Officers Technical Representative (COR) the contractor will develop policies and procedures for handling, manipulating, and storing the data. Specific attention will be given to the file naming conve ntions used for both data and image files. Based on the experience gained from the initial test, the contractor will prepare a data management plan that will establish the COR approved policies and procedures to be used throughout this contract. Once the finding aid and data management plan are complete, the contractor will review the electronic files for duplicates.  Based on the information contained in the file name, content, and properties of the individual records, the contractor will remove duplicative material and store it in separate, clearly marked folders.  Next, the contractor will organize the remaining data by establishing separate files for each major Corps of Engineers, government, or non-government organization whose records appear in the CEHO collection.  Within those files, the contractor will create sub-files by organization, program, and project. Images will be group ed together in separate files within the applicable sub-files. The arrangement of the electronic data within subject files will help researchers access the material, but the contractor will also provide a capability for researchers to search across the entire GWOT electronic data collection by either keyword, a combin ation of words, or date.  The search provisions and data management tools must also include the ability to organize the records by date.  After the GWOT electronic data collection is arranged and indexed, the contractor will be responsible for migrating the data into CEHOs Electronic Research Collection. The contractor will be responsible for recommending how the new material should be arra nged, and whether a new records series of finding aids need to be created to handle the new records. The contractor will be responsible for entering the new material gleaned from the GWOT electronic data collection into CEHOs existing finding aids or prep aring new finding aids if the situation warrants.  2. Reporting  The contractor is expected to work closely with the COR throughout the course of this project.  A preliminary work plan with milestones, as well as monthly reporting requirements, will be established at an initial meeting between contractor and government personnel to be held at the Humphreys Engineer Center, Alexandria, Virginia, within 15 days of contract award.   The plan will be periodically revised and updated by the contractor and the COR. 3). Location and Government Furnished Equipment  The majority of the work will be performed at the Humphreys Engineer Center. The government will furnish the contractor with the necessary workspace and a computer within the CEHO research facilities. The contractor will be required to complete and submit the necessary background security checks to gain access to the USACE network. If the contractor is not able to gain access to the network, it will result in the cancellation of this contract. 4) Products  a)	Preliminary finding aid of GWOT electronic data collection b)	Comprehensive GWOT electronic data collection management plan c)	Arranged documents  d)	Accessioned materials  e)	New or updated finding aids   5) Payment Twenty-five percent (25 %) of the award price will be paid to the contractor upon the completion of a satisfactory data management plan.  An additional sixty percent (60%) of the contract, payable in three equal installments, will be paid to the contractor  as the GWOT electronic data collection (less duplicate records) is arranged and indexed. The final fifteen percent (15%) of the contract will be paid to the contractor when the arranged documents are transferred to CEHOs Electronic Research Collection an d the necessary finding aids prepared and accepted by the government.     6) Contractor Qualifications and Experience  a)	All personnel working on the project must demonstrate that they have at least a masters degree in history or a related subject and five years experience in working with material related to the history of the Corps of Engineers. b)	All personnel working on the project must have at least two years experience working with USACE digital records related to current operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.  c)	All personnel working on the project must have two years experience preparing finding aids in accordance with generally accepted professional practices.  7) Service Contract Requirements Contract Manpower Reporting Clause The Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Manpower & Reserve Affairs) operates and maintains a secure Army data collection site where the contractor will report ALL contractor manpower (including subcontractor manpower) required for performance of  this contract.

1.0 	INTRODUCTION
1.1	Purpose
The purpose of this requirement is to purchase B test fixture components for evaluating FIPS201 products and services.  
1.2	Background
Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12), "Policy for a Common Identification Standard for Federal Employees and Contractors? requires agencies to use only information technology products and services that meet this standard. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has designated the General Services Administration (GSA) as the Executive Agent for government-wide acquisitions for the implementation of HSPD-12. HSPD-12 establishes the requirement for a mandatory Government wide standard for secure and reliable forms of identification issued by the Federal Government to its employees and contractors. OMB has directed Federal agencies to purchase only products and services that are compliant with the Federal policy, standards and numerous supporting technical specifications, including: 

? Federal Information Processing Standard 201, Personal Identity Verification of Federal Employees and Contractors; 
? National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publications (SP) 800-73, Interfaces for Personal Identity Verification, 800-78 Cryptographic Algorithms and Key Sizes for Personal Identity Verification, and 800-79, Guidelines for the Certification and Accreditation of PIV Card Issuing Organizations; and 
? Special Publication 800-76, Biometric Data Specification for Personal Identity Verification (Pending). 

To ensure standard compliant products and services are available, NIST will issue test suites in SP 800-85 - PIV Middleware and PIV Card Application Conformance Test Guidelines (SP800-73 Compliance), and will publish National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP) accredited validation services for demonstrating conformance for products. Providers of products and services that are determined to conform to the standard will be eligible to offer approved products and services on a new GSA procurement vehicle established to align all agency acquisitions with policy.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide answers to questions received from potential offerors and to provide additional information to be used as a guide with the specifications:

1.  Q:  Regarding point 2.3.5.2 for the integration of your electron source LEG 200 we would need some more information on the scan unit. Do you know if it has an analog external input? It would be very helpful if you could provide us with a copy of the manual.

A:  The scan unit does not have an analog external input that I can tell.
Although, the little bit of documentation that I have indicates that it could be computer controlled.  The scan unit has 4 cables that come out (x1, x2, y1, y2) to the LEG 200 gun which controls the raster and has 2 cables that come in from the secondary electron detector (a BNC video in and a strange 9 pin connector that is also labeled video input).  The x and y output voltages start at 100 VDC and decrease to nearly 0 as the magnification is increased.  I did not put the outputs to an oscilliscope to determine what frequency is being used to sweep the beam.  The rate at which the x (1 & 2) and y (1&2) voltages are switched.  This causes a rastering of the electron beam in order to obtain a TV image.  Have you ever looked at the SETTINGS of your computer monitor?
The frequency can be 50 Hz, 68 Hz, 72 Hz, or nearly any value.  For the scan unit to form a secondary electron detection (the TV image), the electron beam must be rastered by switching voltages at a frequency.  I do not know the frequency the scan unit is using.

2.  Q:  Point 2.6.2 I understand that we should also offer an additional In-situ ultra-high vacuum transfer system consisting of a track and trolley system and wobblestick. We thought that you would want to use your existing transfer system. Please clarify if we should offer this.

A:  We do not need a trolley system.  We already have a cart and trolley system, which must be used.  Any new chamber must have a port and proper dimensions to allow the trolley system to bring samples into the XPS system from the connecting Preparation Chamber.  The port should be an 8" (inches) CF flange, as that is what is currently used.  It is conceivable that a 6" CF flange may work as the cart is only 3.5" wide and 3" tall.  We do not need a wobble stick either, as we have one which can be used.  The purpose of section 2.6.2 was to provide information on how samples are to be brought into the XPS system by us.

3.  Q:  Do you accept payment terms that are:
65% prepay (on order)
30% on delivery
5% on final acceptance

A:  Payment arrangements can be in accordance with FAR Part 12.  
4.  Q:  Is there a given budget on the bid?

A:   No.  

5.  Q:  Would it be possible for the end user to supply details about the existing chamber pumping and any pumping associated with individual instruments?
 
A:  The chamber is pumped through a 10 inch CF flange attached to a "cross".  Off of the cross are a CryoTorr 8 cryopump, a large ion pump ( > 200 l/s), and a titanium sublimation pump.  There is a small ion pump (< 60 l/s) that is used to differentially pump the old monochromatic x-ray source and diffraction crystal.  There is a small diffusion pump which is turned on to differentially pump the ion gun and helium UV source, and it connects to the system through a ~1.5 inch pipe.  There are two mechanical pumps which are used for backing the diffusion pump and the helium UV source.
 
6.  Q:  Is it possible for the end user to supply additional details about the existing systems wafer manipulator and transfer devices? Specifically, what is the Z (up/down) travel of the manipulator and how many ancillary devices are needed to move the wafer samples on to the manipulator from the transfer chamber?
 
A:  Yes.  The Z up/down travel of the 3" wafer manipulator is ~4 inches, with it going ~0.5 inches above the chamber center line and ~3.5 inches below the chamber center line.  Only one wobble stick is required to lift the wafer sample off of the cart and place it onto teh 3" wafer manipulator.  The wafer sample holder has a hole in its' ring that a pin on the wobble stick goes through, and thus allowing the wafer sample holder to be picked up.

7.   The following DFARS clause is incorporated:  DFARS 252-227-7015, Technical Data, Commercial Items (NOV 1995).

8.   The government will incorporate the following provision into any ensuing contract:  

This document contains proprietary commercial technical data of * for company * delivered under contract number *. Use, copying or disclosure by the U.S. Government of the Technical Data contained herein is Governed by the terms of DFARS 252.227-7015, Technical Data, Commercial Items (NOV 1995).

* To be completed at time of award
