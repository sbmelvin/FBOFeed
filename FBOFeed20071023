SECURITY REQUIREMENTS

GENERAL

DHS has determined that performance of this contract requires that the Contractor, subcontractor(s) vendor(s), etc. (herein known as Contractor), have access to DHS facilities and that the Contractor will adhere to the following:

SUITABILITY DETERMINATION

DHS shall have and exercise full control over granting, denying, withholding or terminating unescorted government facility access for Contractor employees based upon the results of a FBI Fingerprint Check.  No employee of the Contractor shall be allowed unescorted access to a Government facility without a favorable suitability determination by the Security Office.

BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION

Contract employees (to include applicants, temporaries, part-time and replacement employees) under the contract, needing unescorted building access shall undergo a fingerprint check.  All fingerprint checks will be processed through the Security Office.  Prospective Contractor employees shall submit the following completed forms to the Security Office through the COTR no less than 30 days before the starting date of the contract or 30 days prior to entry on duty of any employees, whether a replacement, addition, sub-contractor employee, or vendor:

1.	Standard Form 85P, ??Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions??

2.	FD Form 258, ??Fingerprint Card?? (2 copies)

3.	Foreign National Relatives or Associates Statement

DHS will provide required forms at the time of award of the contract.  Only complete packages will be accepted by the Security Office.  Specific instructions on submission of packages will be provided upon award of the contract.

DHS will consider only US Citizens and Legal Permanent Residents for employment on this contract.

CONTINUED ELIGIBILITY

If a prospective employee is found to be ineligible for access to Government Facilities the COTR will advise the contractor that the employee shall not be assigned to work under the contract.

The Security Office may require drug screening for probable cause at any time and/or when the contractor independently identifies circumstances where probable cause exists.

DHS reserves the right to deny and/or restrict the facility access of any Contractor employee whose actions are in conflict with the DHS standards of conduct, 5 CFR 2635 and 5CFR 3801, or whom DHS determines to present a risk of compromising sensitive Government information to which he or she would have access under this contract.

The Contractor will report any adverse information coming to their attention concerning contract employees under the contract to DHS Security Office.  Reports based on rumor or innuendo should not be made.  The subsequent termination of employee does not obviate the requirement to submit this report.  The report shall include the employees?? name and social security number, along with the adverse information being reported.

The Security Office must be notified of all terminations/resignations within five days of occurrence.  The Contractor will return any expired DHS issued identification cards and building passes, or those of terminated employees to the COTR.  If an identification card or building pass is not available to be returned, a report must be submitted to the COTR, referencing the pass or card number, name of individual to whom issued, the last known location and disposition of the pass or card.

EMPLOYMENT ELIGIBILITY

The Contractor must agree that each employee working on this contract will have a Social Security Card issued and approved by the Social Security Administration.  The Contractor shall be responsible to the Government for acts and omissions of his own employees and for any Subcontractor(s) and their employees.

In the interest of limiting access to potentially sensitive information and Information Technology (IT) Systems, DHS will consider only US Citizens and Lawful Permanent Residents (LPR) for employment on this contract.  DHS will not approve LPRs for employment on this contract in any position requiring the LPR to access or assist in the development, operation, management or maintenance of Department of Homeland Security (DHS) IT systems, unless a waiver has been granted by the DHS Chief Information Officer.

EVALUATION CRITERIA

A firm-fixed price order will be made to the lowest price technically acceptable, responsive offeror, whose proposal will meet the Governments?? requirement.

PAYMENT

A purchase order will be issued for the work described in this notice.  NET 30 payment terms will apply to the order, however, payment will not be made until inspection and acceptance of work has been performed by the Government and an acceptable, original invoice has been submitted by the vendor.  An invoice shall not be submitted until all work has been completed and accepted by the Government.

Quotes are due by November 2, 2007 at 4:00 PM Central Time.   All responsible sources should submit a response via email to:  Lety.Ramos@dhs.gov; or fax to (956) 764-3047.  Questions regarding this requirement should be forwarded to Leticia Ramos via email or via phone @ (956) 764-3278.

<DESC>The NATO Air Command & Control System Management Agency (NACMA) intends to advertise for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on works and services within the framework of the NATO Security Investment Program. Eligible firms will be invited to bid for the Provision of Deployable Ground-Air-Ground (G/A/G) Communications and Deployable Ground-Maritime (G/M)Communications.

The procurement will include Technical and Logistics Services, i.e., engineering, implementation, equipment testing in the factory and on-site, DARS integration testing, Integrated Logistics Support (ILS), spares, training, documentation, and warranty.

NACMA is serving as the Host Nation for this project, which was authorized by the NATO Infrastructure Committee. The envisaged method of bidding will be in accordance with the one envelope procedure. Contractor selection will normally results in contract award to the lowest compliant bidder.

NACMA has requested that the estimated value of this project not be disclosed at this time. The Invitation for Bids (IFB) to be issued for this acquisition is identified as IFB-CO-12108-ACCS and all correspondence concerning this solicitation should reference this number. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the same reference.

The IFB package, including technical specifications applicable to the bidding and the contractual documents is NATO UNCLASSIFIED. Please note, however, that the successful contractor will be required to handle and store classified information up to the level of NATO SECRET and only companies maintaining such a facility clearance will be eligible to bid on this project. In addition, contractor personnel working on NATO sites will be required to hold individual security clearances of NATO SECRET.

The contractor is responsible for ensuring that the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) forwards to the Host Nation the NATO clearance certifications for all personnel assigned to the contract.

BACKGROUND

The NATO Air Command and Control System (ACCS) aims to provide NATO with a fully integrated Air Operations and Airspace Management System to replace the existing range of outdated and inflexible systems currently being employed throughout the NATO region. The development program is extremely challenging, both in terms of technical complexity and time scale of implementation. It requires the development of a significant amount of software and, due to the distributed nature of the system, has many interoperability and system integrity challenges. ACCS is too large and embracing to be developed through a single implementation project and hence is being procured as a series of projects, each building on the previous to develop the overall planned capability.

The NATO ACCS Management Agency (NACMA) exists to ensure system integrity, provide central planning, system engineering, implementation and configuration for ACCS, without prejudice to the existing configuration control responsibilities of the operational commanders for in-service systems. Such activities may include improvements to existing systems, design studies on future systems, and the development of new systems through projects assigned to it. The role of NACMA can thus be summarized as threefold: global ACCS planning, ensuring interoperability and integrity, and the implementation of ACCS projects.

Deployable ARS (DARS) is an element of the Deployable ACCS Component (DAC) and is designed to augment or reinforce parts of the static ACCS structure or to be deployed as a stand-alone unit. A DARS will be fielded with the complete functionality of an ACCS ARS with its own organic ground/air, data link and deployable bearer communications. In addition, DARS Quick Reaction Package (QRP) is being implemented to support smaller scale NRF deployments.

G/A/G & G/M Communications Project:

The project comprises five systems: three (3) Deployable G/A/G and two (2) G/M systems. Each system will include a vehicle, Power Generation System (PGS) and a cabin installed with all communications equipment, spares and antennas. The systems shall be dismountable from the host vehicle to permit operation without the vehicle or transportation via other flatbed trucks.

The G/A/G system will be organic to the DAC elements in order to provide a communications capability to provide the DARS with Ground to Air, ECM resistant, secure V/UHF communication (voice & data) with friendly aircraft within the coverage of associated conventional active sensors.

The G/M system will be organic to the DAC elements in order to provide a communications capability to provide the DARS with resistant, secure U/HF communication (voice & data) with maritime forces operating within the DARS Area of Operation.

SCOPE OF PROJECT

In order to achieve commonality with the Deployable Air Control Center, the Recognized Air Picture (RAP) Production Center, and the Sensors Fusion Post (DARS), the procurement of the following items will be directed by the purchaser. The bid prices for the directed purchases will be part of the bid evaluation to establish the lowest compliant bid: 

V/UHF Saturn/Havequick II: The contractor will be directed to procure radios from the supplier delivering Saturn/Havequick II radio to the DARS QRP to ensure interoperability and compatibility.

HF Radios: The contractor will be directed to procure HF radios from the supplier delivering HF radios to the DARS/DARS QRP to ensure interoperability and compatibility.

L16 MIDS LVTs: The contractor will be directed to procure the MIDS LVTs 4 to ensure commonality of logistics support with the one implemented for DARS. The associated crypto chip will be procured by the NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) and integrated into the terminal.

L11A Equipment Suites (ES): The contractor will be directed to procure these suites to ensure compatibility and to enable interoperability with the L11A ES implemented for DARS.

The procurement will include an Interactive Electronic Technical Manual (IETM) integrated into the IETM provided for the ACCS LOC1 and present within the DARS-Entity content.

The bidders will also be required to quote for additional quantities of the G/A/G system only. This option will not be evaluated in the determination of the lowest apparently compliant bidder.

In order to retain flexibility with other NATO programs, achieve standardization, commonality in deployment and reduce procurement and O&M cost, the following items, will be provided to the contractor as Purchaser Furnished Equipment (PFE):

Link 16 Equipment Suites (L16 ES): NACMA will procure these from the ACCS LOC1 prime contractor, Air Command Systems International (ACSI), under the existing LOC1 contract. This approach will ensure schedule compatibility, cost-efficient O&M and reduced technical risk for interfacing with the DARs, especially for complex configuration, i.e. remote configuration over SATCOM.

BME: NACMA will request NC3A to procure this equipment.

Crypto Devices: NATO standard crypto equipment that will be procured by NC3A.

The IFB will include a requirement for prospective bidders to demonstrate their ability to undertake this project and a requirement to demonstrate experience of recent provision of similar types of systems.

The quoter sho!  uld not describe past performance history in the quote. The information should include, however, discussion of any major problems encountered on the contracts listed and the corrective actions taken to resolve them. The information may also include a description of any quality awards earned by the quoter.  The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government.  Quoters lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  However, the quote of a company with no relevant past performance history, while not rated favorably or unfavorably for past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the responses of other quoters.  The quoter should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or aff!  irmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or sim ilar past performance.  The assessment of the quoters past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the responder and other competitors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFQ.  The Government will give greater consideration to the contracts that the Government feels are most relevant to the RFQ Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Quoters must be registered in the CCR database to be considered for award. Registration is free and can be completed on-line at http://www.ccr.gov/ . All quotes shall include price(s), FOB point, a point of contact, name and phone number, GSA contract number if applicable, business size, Federal Tax ID Number, Cage Code, DUNs Number and payment terms. Quotes over 10 pages in total will not be accepted by facsimile.  Each response must clearly indicate the capability of the quoter to meet all specifications and requirements.

<b><u>Technical Assistance for the Mauritius Land Based Ocean Industry</u></b>
The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide technical assistance to give the Government of Mauritius (GOM) the capability to support the development of the Land Based Ocean Industry (LBOI) through the establishment of an appropriate regulatory framework and an action plan for supporting a range of down steam applications for the deep sea water resource.

The GOM is launching the LBOI program to exploit new industrial opportunities based on the commercial utilization of the deep Indian Ocean seawater in Mauritius.  The new industry is seen by the public and private sector of Mauritius as potentially diversifying the Mauritian economy, generating substantial foreign exchange, and creating a number of direct and indirect jobs over the next five to ten years.

The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) Technical Assistance will give the GOM the capability to support the development of the LBOI through:

the establishment of an appropriate regulatory framework, which will provide the private sector companies that will drive the project, a fair, open and conducive environment in which to operate; and

an action plan for government support for a range of down steam applications for the deep sea water resource.  This will include addressing constraints such as inadequate trade-related infrastructure.  

The Grantee, The Board of Investment (BOI), is the leading agency of the GOM responsible for promoting and facilitating investment in Mauritius. BOI is the national investment promotion agency falling under the aegis of the Ministry of Finance, GOM.  The State Investment Corporation and the Mauritius Research Council are also important GOM stakeholders in the development of this project.

The proposed Technical Assistance shall be provided through the following tasks:
Task 1.  	Develop Model LBOI Regulatory Regime
Task 2.   	Prepare LBOI Industry Profile and Commercialization Action Plan 				(including preliminary environmental assessment).
Task 3.	Training and Capacity Building Program
Task 4.		Developmental Impact Considerations 
Task 5.		Final Report

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $375,000 grant to the Grantee from USTDA.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to: <b><a href=https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp>https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp</a></b>.  Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by <u>4:00PM</u>, <u>December 13, 2007</u> at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) intends to negotiate with Westat  Inc., Coordinating Center Contractor (HHSN268200417175C) for the Retrovirus Epidemiology Donor Study-II (REDS-II) to act on behalf of NHLBI to solicit proposals from organizations to refine, assemble, and validate the HIV SELECTEST enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (EIA) kits, in addition to developing an HIV Rapid test based on HIV-SELECT technology.  Westat will conduct peer review of proposals, negotiate and award one subcontract.  The addition of the proposed subcontract will augment the REDS II work scope to refine, assemble, validate and obtain FDA licensing of HIV SELECTEST enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (EIA) kits for distribution to national and international laboratories conducting Phase I-III HIV-1 vaccine trials, as well as develop, refine, assemble, validate and obtain FDA licensing of a Rapid HIV-1 Antibody Test based on the HIV SELECTEST.  The period of performance for the HIV SELECTEST will be three years.

Westat Inc. has been intimately involved over the past two years in the HIV SELECTEST evaluation efforts with input from REDS-II investigators.  Westat, working through the REDS-II central laboratory, provided well-pedigreed plasma and serum sample from REDS bio-specimen repositories for use in determining the sensitivity, specificity, reproducibility, and predictive value of the HIV-SELECTEST.  Westat was heavily involved with coordinating testing and conducting data entry, analysis and verification of test results.  Westat also assisted with the analysis of the study findings.  As a result, Westat, Inc. has a comprehensive understanding of the HIV-SELECTEST platform and the studies that support its use as an HIV test to differentiate between vaccine-induced positivity and true infection positivity.  In addition to Westat's involvement with REDS, they coordinate large scale clinical trials and HIV infectivity studies.  Because of Westat's experience and expertise in the development and evaluation of the HIV-SELECTEST, it is essential that it continues to be directly involved in this project if the project is to be completed successfully and in a timely manner.  The HIV-SELECTEST kits will be distributed to national and international laboratories conducting Phase I-III HIV preventive and therapeutic vaccine trials.

It is essential that the HIV-SELECTEST be evaluated first in HIV-1 vaccine trials to determine the test's sensitivity, specificity, reproducibility, and predictive value. The next step is to evaluate the HIV-SELECTEST in the blood bank setting.  The plan is to conduct these studies, in the future, within the REDS-II international component in China and Brazil, which currently conduct extensive HIV risk factor studies.  Westat coordinates these studies as well under the coordinating center contract and administers the contracts for all aspects of the foreign work.  It is crucial that Westat continue in its major role as coordinator of the HIV SELECTEST project.  Not to do so would eliminate a significant contributor to HIV-SELECTEST development and result in protracted and unacceptable delays.  The joint effort involving NHLBI, FDA, Westat and REDS-II investigators has resulted in the development of a test that can distinguish between vaccine generated antibodies and antibodies resulting from HIV-1 infection.  It is essential that Westat continue to coordinate this important effort as they are the only organization with adequate knowledge, experience, expertise and familiarity with this specific test system to both solicit, and evaluate proposals and participate in the work.

Due to the inherent duplication of costs and unacceptable delays in performance, a noncompetitive modification to the current contract is in the best interest of the Government.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements as described above.  All responses must be submitted by December 10, 2007, to the following address:  Dawn Rabunsky, Contracting Officer, Office of Acquisitions, NHLBI, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Bethesda, MD 20892-7902.  All responses which are timely received shall be considered by the Agency.  A determination not to compete the proposed work based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.  This notice of intent is not an announcement of the availability of a Request for Proposals (RFP), nor is a RFP available.  Authority: 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-(1)(b)(1).  Westat is uniquely qualified to be the only responsible source to be able to serve as the Coordinating Center for the HIV SELECTEST subcontract.  See Number Note 22.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

FOR INFORMATION ONLY: This project is required by the Armys Military Construction (MILCON) Transformation initiatives under the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC), the Global Defense Posture Realignment (GDPR) (formerly known as Integrated Global Presence  Basing Strategy (IGBPS)), the Army Modular Force (AMF) program, and the Armys Grow the Force (GTF) initiative.  The Army must posture facilities to effectively orient combat capabilities where they can most effectively organize, train, and deploy to suppo rt ongoing operations worldwide.  The Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (ACSIM) has challenged the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to find ways to streamline its acquisition and construction processes in order to reduce costs and sp eed up overall delivery of projects, while at the same time providing quality facilities.  The Army requires a minimum 15% reduction in cost and a minimum 20% reduction in time to occupancy.  USACE, in response thereto, created eight Centers of Standardiza tion (COS) that are not only the design centers of expertise but also will become the acquisition experts for the facility types for which the COS is assigned.  Forty-one facility types were identified for standardization.  Of those forty-one, Fort Worth D istrict (SWF) has been assigned responsibility for the Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH), Basic Training (BT) Barracks, Advanced Individual Training (AIT) Barracks, Central Issue Warehouses and General Purpose Warehouses.

<DESC>Due to the southern California wildfires, the due date for this solicitation is postponed from 10/26/07 to 11/2/07.  The U. S. Postal Service is soliciting Contractor Qualification Statements from construction contractors desiring to be placed on a list of prequalified general contractors for construction of repair and alteration projects in northern California.  This area extends from the northern California border down to and including the counties of Monterey, Kings, Tulare and Inyo.  Construction activities may occur in operating mail-handling facilities possibly with 24 hour, seven days a week operations, and in such case, construction activities must not interfere with postal operations.  Only the most qualified contractors will be prequalified.  To be considered for prequalification, respondents must demonstrate a minimum of five years of experience, must have completed a minimum of two comparable projects in the area over the past five years, and must hold a current State of California contractor?s license or have an application for said license on file with the state license board.  Comparable projects for the purpose of this solicitation are defined as repair and alteration projects of commercial/light industrial type facilities and a construction cost of $1,500,000.  Qualification Statements will be evaluated in accordance with the following criteria:  comparable experience (60 points); non-comparable experience (40 points); organization (30 points); safety (20 points).  Other factors that will be evaluated on a pass/fail basis are:  background information, eligibility, certification and affirmation, financial capability, bonding information.  Contractors placed on the prequalified list will be requested to submit a management plan and cost proposal that will be project specific.  Prequalified firms will have the option to submit a proposal for one or all of the projects as they become available.  Award of individual contracts will be made to the firm offering the best value to the Postal Service within available funding in accordance with evaluation criteria stated in individual project solicitations.  The Postal Service retains the right to:  (1) Delete from the prequalified list any firm that is no longer deemed to be responsible or is otherwise ineligible to receive a contract award.  (2) Prequalify additional firms that will be eligible to receive solicitations for facilities to be expanded, repaired, or altered.  This right will be exercised when the number of existing prequalified firms is not sufficient to ensure adequate competition.

<DESC>NOTES: a.  Deadline for submission has been extended to 5 November 2007. b.  Please submit five (5) copies of proposals. c.  Proposals may be hand-delivered or sent by overnight mail to U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District, ATTN:  James S. Turkel, Room 7620, 10 South Howard Street, Baltimore, MD  21201. Additional clarifying information on the Request for Site Availability is provided in question and answer format below: FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS 1.  The solicitation requires a great deal of information from offerors.  Would the Corps of Engineers grant an extension of time to allow for the submission of detailed proposals?   	A:  The due date for submission of proposals is extended to November 1, 2007. 2.	The solicitation is a five page document called a sources sought notice seeking expressions of interest.  What is the acquisition strategy envisioned by the Government for this billion dollar project?  What acquisition method will be used?  Does the  Corps of Engineers intend on issuing a more detailed solicitation before eliminating sites from consideration? 	A.  This acquisition is being conducted as a real estate procurement with the intent of purchasing a property having the unique attributes required to fulfill the BRAC 133 recommendation. As indicated in our Request for Site Availability, we will consider  properties in varying degrees of development; i.e., from raw land to turnkey fully developed sites.  Our intent is to explore available sites in a short time frame and at relatively low cost to offerors through this abbreviated solicitation process requir ing the submission of basic, high level information only.  We believe the information to be furnished at this level will sufficiently characterize key aspects of the sites such that we can select one or more to explore in greater detail through a more deta iled Request for Proposals process.   3.  Trucks.  In order for offerors to complete their site layout, the method of delivery of supplies for each building must be known.  Vehicle lengths will impact location, turning distances and road alignments.  Would the Corps of Engineers consider issui ng a more detailed description of transportation infrastructure needs on the site?      Security Access Control Points.  How many inspection lanes will be required to screen the 6,200 assigned personnel working on the site?  Understanding the flow of personnel arrivals and departures is critical in determining the number of inspection la nes and length of waiting lanes necessary at the gates.  Would the Corps issue a more detailed statement of requirements for security access points? 	A.  We do not intend to issue any more detailed statement of requirements for the onsite transportation infrastructure or security access control points at this time.  Again, we are looking for high level, concept layouts that will demonstrate feasibility  and sufficiently allow us to differentiate among initial offers in terms of the key attributes we are seeking.  4 & 5.  The solicitation requests a high level traffic plan which demonstrates successful integration of the site with existing transportation systems.  We understand that the Army has a zip code study that shows residences of employees assigned to the Was hington Headquarters Service.  This information is crucial in order to develop a plan to integrate these additional commuters into the regional transportation system.  Would the Corps of Engineers provide the results of the zip code study to offerors? 	In addition to the zip code study, we would like information on how employees commute to work now  VRE, Metro, carpool, walk or drive  in order to understand the impacts of the new project.  Will the Corps of Engineers provide this information? 	A.  Information showing the current residential distribution of DoD employees being relocated to Fort Belvoir under BRAC and other transportation related information is available in the Armys Fort Belvoir BRAC EnvironmentIS) in the Transportation Chapter (4.3).  The EIS may be accessed at http://www.hqda.army.mil/acsimweb/brac/nepa_eis_docs.htm . 6.  The solicitation specifies that the site location should be in Virginia, within one mile of any Metro station.  Will the Corps of Engineers change this requirement to in Virginia, within 0.5 miles of a Metro or VRE station? 	A.  The requirements as specified in the Request for Site Availability were intentionally not stated as minimum requirements.  While they clearly indicate a preference by the Government, our intent was to leave enough flexibility in the requirements to permit a wide range of possibilities for our consideration from an overall best value perspective. 7 & 8.  The solicitation requires that the space be capable of supporting robust IT requirements to include network transport services for four or more security classifications.  Would the Corps provide information on what outside plant is required in or der to connect to the site?  Are there any dedicated military communications lines that will be run or will all communications be in lines in existing commercial easements and systems? 	Are any antennas required on the site?  If so, how many and what look angles?  Are there any security or safety setback requirements for these items? 	A.  We do not intend to issue any additional clarifying information at this time. 9.  What is the role of the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) in this project?  Does it vary whether the project is inside or outside the Beltway? 	A.  The role played by NCPC in this project will depend upon the site that is ultimately selected and the final structure of the transaction with the successful offeror.  If the Army becomes the executive agent for construction of the facilities on the se lected site, NCPC coordination will be required.  If the Army purchases a turnkey, privately developed project, no NCPC coordination will be required.  In Northern Virginia, federal construction projects require only coordination/consultation with NCPC and  are not subject to their approval.  Federal projects within the District of Columbia require NCPC approval.  The beltway is not a controlling boundary.

<DESC>This amendment is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov  and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the NSWC Division Crane. The amendment and supporting documentation issued in response to the site visit on 18 September can be found under 0001-Amendment and 0001-Attachments located at the NSWC Crane Acquisition website, http://www.crane.navy.mil/acquisition/synopbaa.htm. For the most current information regarding this Amendment 0003, please refer to 0003-Amendment located at the NSWC Crane Acquisition website, http://www.crane.navy.mil/acquisition/synopbaa.htm. Amendment 0003 is issued to extend the offer due date to 09 November 2007, and to provide a second set of questions and answers. Q&A: 1.	Is natural gas available as a back up fuel supply, in lieu of propane (bottled)? A: There is not a natural gas pipe line running to the WWTP. The location of the gas line at the DOL is shown on the previously provided DOL utility drawing. 2.	Is there additional chemical analysis of the digester gas available?  The one provided did not seem to add up to 100%.  Was the January/February data on flow rate extrapolated for annual flow of 15.2 MM cu ft or is there additional flow data as well? A: The analysis provided as an attachment to the BAA is all that is available for a gas analysis.  Bidders are welcome to take additional samples for analysis at their own expense through October 25, 2007.  Newly posted file 2006 Digester gas.pdf provides the best available information on digester gas flow rate. 3.	What is the range of heating required for the sludge over the typical year, max and min in BTUs per hr? A: Newly posted file 2006 Digester gas.pdf provides the best available information on the use of digester gas for heating. 4.	Can an internet connection be provided by the government at the Waste water treatment plant? A:  Two possibilities exist, and implementation will be decided based upon specific needs identified after contract award.  The first possibility would involve re-imaging of the contractors computer by the Ft. Lewis IT office (essentially converting it to a government computer) and giving it VPN capability, so that the contractor can obtain secure access from off the installation.  The operator of the computer would be required to go through the Ft. Lewis security screening process to be issued an access card and password.  The second possibility may involve wireless broadband access from one of the commercial wireless broadband providers; in which case the contractor could access without going through the Ft. Lewis network. 5.	May we assume for budget purposes that material and equipment purchased will be tax exempt? A: No.  Refer to local and federal tax laws for any exemption that may be claimed. 6.	Will bonds be required for construction services? A: A cost type contract is anticipated.  In accordance with DFARS 228.102, no bonds will be required if a cost type contract is awarded.  If a different type of contract is awarded bonds will be required. 7.	Who is the authority having jurisdiction for construction permitting at Ft. Lewis?  Specifically is there a base or county/town Fire Marshall? Building inspector group who will approve design documents before issuing (a) building permit? A: Contractors will develop all necessary permitting information and documentation and submit for approval to the Ft. Lewis POC as identified in the SOW that will be issued at the time of contract.   8.	What is the EMACS system referred to in section 3? A: EMACS is the Defense Logistics Agencys Equipment Management and Control System. 9.	Will there be any charge for propane use if it is only required under backup conditions? A: Propane is already designated for backup use and there would not be a charge for its use for emergencies or minor interruptions.  If the need for propane becomes extensive, then Ft. Lewis would expect that the facility would be reverted back to its normal mode of operation. 10.	Is 480 V power available at the treatment plant?  Where is the switchgear room?  Please include a single line and electrical routing or layout with the drawings provided. A: See Newly posted CAD file C-E00-08R.dwg and Adobe version of the CAD file C-E00-08R FINAL REVISED ONE LINE DIAGRAM  ELECTRICAL POWER DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM 11.	Can you send us a single line drawing for the existing WWTP electrical room and a physical layout for this room? A: This information is not readily available at this stage, and this level of detail is not considered to be necessary for initial response to the BAA.  Upon Government review of proposals, this information may be made available if required to support final selection and to refine costs prior to contract award. 12.	Can you send the manufacturer, model and serial number for the existing sludge pumps, gas blowers, and spiral sludge heat exchanger? A: This information is not readily available at this stage, and this level of detail is not considered to be necessary for initial response to the BAA.  Upon Government review of proposals, this information may be made available if required to support final selection and to refine costs prior to contract award.

The exam must include a doctor-patient discussion of positive findings on examination.  The doctor is to send a copy of the physical examination and tests to the patient and to the MRO.

MSHA Checklist for Periodic/Exit Exams

The examining physician must discuss the medical history form (SF 93) and any pre-existing conditions with patient.  The examining physician must then address and document any positive medical history, physical findings, and significant abnormal lab values before exam is sent for QA.  Ensure that all requested forms and test results are attached!  Incomplete forms and missing test results ultimately delay the review which can restrict employees from regular duties.

<DESC>The Space Superiority Systems Wing (SYSW) intends to release Request for Proposal number FA8819-07-R-0003 for the Space Control Depot Support (SCDS) on 26 October 2007. The SCDS is for sustainment support services of the various SMC/SYSW ground-based deployable systems. The programs to be supported by this contract include: the Counter Communication System (CCS) Family of Systems, the Space Test and Training Range (STTR) Family of Systems, the Rapid Attack Identification Detection and Reporting System (RAIDRS) Family of Systems and Rapid Reaction Capabilities (RRCs), along with emerging deployable SYSW system whose sustainment requirements are in-line with the scope of the SCDS contract. The SCDS contract will be managed by SYSW/OS. The sustainment requirements of the SCDS contract are broken into five functional areas: 1) Depot Support, 2) Studies & Analysis, 3) System Upgrades and Modifications, 4) Rapid Reaction Capability Transition to Operational Systems, and 5) Organizational Level Maintenance. Depot support consists of the following: depot and sustainment engineering (D&SE), repairable and disposable item management, stock, storage and issuance of spares, hardware and software maintenance and repairs, sparing level analysis, etc. Studies and analysis projects in support of the basic program mission includes, but is not limited to: analyses to reduce life cycle costs, improving availability and maintainability, the replacement of obsolete or /unsupportable equipment, the evaluation of future capability enhancements, preplanned product improvement (P3I), etc. System upgrades and modifications may include the development, test, production and installation of system upgrades. The transition of RRCs to operational systems includes activities such as developing technical orders (TOs), drawing packages, performing provisioning analysis and procuring spares and support equipment, and configuration management and standardization of hardware and software. Organization Level Maintenance is defined as on-site maintenance support at operational units. 

The Request for Proposal (RFP) documents are classified, therefore, the RFP will be released only to the Offerors who have a facility cleared by SYSW/AS to handle government information up to, and including, Top Secret/SCI/SAR.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) GSA New England is seeking qualified installers of micro-turbines and wind turbines to provide sufficient information to allow for an informed evaluation and decision as to the application of the two technologies as a secure, stand alone, 24/7 power supply  for the Armstrong-Jackman International Border Station (Border Station) in Jackman, Maine.  The facility is located at U.S. Route 201 and the International Point of Entry to the Province of Quebec, Canada.  This RFI will be conducted under the [Commercial Items/Negotiated] procedures in accordance with the FAR Part [12/15].  The NAICS code for this service is 221119.  Interested firms have 25 calendar days from the date of this synopsis publication to submit in writing to the above named point of contact, clear and convincing documentation of the company?s economic and technical capability to provide the required services, and initial response to the questions asked below.  Such documentation will be utilized solely for the purpose of determining the responsibility status of the respondent firms.  This notice of intent is for the purpose of determining the availability of Contractors and not a request for competitive proposals.  The electric service will be required on October 2008 and a Request for Proposal for this requirement will be determined at a later date based upon the estimated time requirement for environmental studies, right-of-way acquisition, state permitting procedures and utility construction. 

The Proposed Border Station is a 60,000 sq ft facility with an estimated connected load of 2,400 amps.  The GSA is considering the use of LP, propane, diesel, bio diesel, or other fueled micro turbines to provide on site, off grid three-phase power supply for the new Port of Entry.  The GSA is also considering the installation of a small wind turbine sized between 20kW ? 100 kW to supplement the micro turbine power plant.  


Background and Required Services

The existing Border Station currently receives single phase, 120/240 volt electrical service from Hydro-Quebec Distribution, the government-owned electrical distribution utility firm.  Due to a major renovation and expansion of the Border Station, three-phase, 120/208 volt, electric service will be required as a permanent electrical service.  The nearest known source of three phase electric distribution facilities are from the Central Maine Power Company in the vicinity of the town of Jackman, Maine and Hydro-Quebec Distribution on the Quebec province side of the International Boundary. In order to supply three-phase service a fifteen mile three-phase line extension from the nearest source of power will be required.

Based on the estimated diversified electrical demand of approximately 1200 amps the new facility will use approximately 433 kilowatts and the estimated load factor projected to be in excess of 50 percent estimated annual electrical usage of 460,000 kilowatt-hours.  The facilities to the Border Station shall meet the legal requirements of the local and/or state governmental bodies seeking approval and all facilities located on Government property shall be placed underground utilizing [pad-mounted/submersible] equipment suitable for [surface/vault] use.  

The GSA is seeking answers to the following:

How feasible is the idea of building a secure, 24/7 on site power plant using micro turbines?

What would the installation entail?

How many micro turbines would be necessary to supply 100% of the stated facility needs?

Would the micro turbines need to be housed?

Could the micro turbines be used in a combined heat and power scenario? 

If so how much heat would be produced from the micro turbines?

How would the heat be recovered and delivered to occupied space?

Could the micro turbines be duel fueled?  What is the projected availability for one or more secure fuel sources?

How would the installation of a CHP micro turbine power plant, impact the current design, consisting of oil fired, cast iron hot water boilers and AHU?s with chilled water coils?

What type of maintenance would be needed over the life of the facility?

How would a 20kW ? 100 kW wind turbine be integrated?

Would the planned emergency generator (diesel fueled) be obsolete, or required?

What would be the approximate installed cost to the GSA if a micro turbine CHP plant were selected?

Is it possible to purchase the heat and power from a micro turbine CHP plant and windmill and have the plant owned and operated by the installer?  What would be the financial implications of such an arrangement?

What Authorities having jurisdiction/oversight of the New England Grid, or the State of Maine, or the Province of Quebec would need to be notified?

Could we maintain the current single phase grid connection, while being powered on site?  What would that cost?

How could that existing single phase power line best be utilized?

What are the qualifications of the installer/owner/operator?
 
Note:  to assist qualified responders to this RFI, the following documents are available: The AWS True Wind report titled Wind Energy Siting Recommendations for the Jackman Border Facility and a translated synopsis of Hydro Quebec?s interconnection requirements (E.1205 document) for power stations with their grid.  These reports are for shared information only, and in no way shall be construed as final, fact, or directional.  To receive a copy please send a request to kathryn.thomas@gsa.gov.



Regulatory Status

The northern portion of Somerset County, Maine is not part of an existing utility supplier?s franchised service territory.  Currently, as a result of the facility?s regulatory status, no utility supplier or party has the responsibility or the absolute right to provide service to the Border Station.  Also, based upon preliminary discussions with the Maine Public Utilities Commission (Commission), it is unlikely that any party seeking to provide service to the Border station will be required to obtain its formal approval or obtain a Certificate of Convenience and Necessity to install facilities to the Border Station.

<CONTACT>Karen Mercer, (609) 485-6747
<DESC>Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) TCBAA-08-0002 Rotorcraft Damage Tolerance (RCDT) For Metallic Materials *****The FAA will host the Rotorcraft Damage Tolerance (RCDT) Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) meeting on November 15, 2007 starting at 9:00am.  The RCDT BAA meeting is to be held at the FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center.  Attendees are required to contact Felix Abali (609 485-7549, Felix.Abali@faa.gov) by November 5 to register for the meeting and to obtain additional meeting detailed information.***** 1. Background The FAA is currently considering the damage tolerance requirement for rotorcraft structures and dynamic components.  While the damage tolerance methodology has been extensively and successfully used in fix-wing aircraft structures, rotorcraft has just begun to use it in addition to the safe-life approach.  Generally, safe-life, in flight hours, is experimentally determined using the mission profile, flight loads, and S-N data.  Using Miner's cumulative fatigue damage rule, a fatigue damage rate for each flight condition is typically calculated by assessing the damaging load cycles per hour from the flight spectrum and loads data, the ratio of the alternating load to the endurance limit, and the cycles-to-failure from a standard component S-N curve.  A reciprocal summation of each fatigue damage rate for each flight condition then determines the retirement life of the part being analyzed. In contrast to safe-life, the damage tolerance (DT) approach assumes that an inherent flaw or crack exists in the manufactured part.  The life of the part is determined using fracture mechanics methodologies, load spectrum, manufacturing process and operating environment.  Based on the computed crack growth life of the inherent flaw or crack, suitable inspection intervals are established so that cracks can be found and repaired long before they achieve a critical length.  The effectiveness of the damage tolerance approach depends on several factors that include fatigue crack growth data, initial crack sizes, fracture mechanics and computational methods, effects of shot-peening and cold working, and inspection techniques. The success of implementing the damage tolerance approach to fixed-wing aircraft structures, coupled with the FAA's goal to enhance aircraft safety has lead to RCDT research and development (R&D) efforts for rotorcraft.  In 2005, the FAA assessed the current state of RCDT and fracture mechanics technologies.  During the assessment, the FAA asked the rotorcraft community for their inputs on fracture mechanics and RCDT-related technologies.  The FAA then conducted the gap analysis to identify research needs for supporting FAA rulemaking.  Identified RCDT research tasks were then prioritized using the FAA prioritization process and criteria.  Finally, a roadmap for RCDT was developed to guide the research to support FAA rulemaking and the implementation of RCDT requirement.    2. Purpose The objective of this BAA is to solicit proposals to conduct the RCDT research to support FAA rulemaking.  Particularly, this effort shall support FAR 29.571, 27.571, AC 29-2A, AC 27-1A, AC-29-2C, FAA Order 8110.9 which can be downloaded using the following link: http://www.airweb.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgAdvisoryCircular.nsf/MainFrame?OpenFrameSet 3. Submission Deadlines Technical proposals shall be prepared according to guidelines described in sections 4 (Submission Requirements), 5 (Three-Page Technical Summary Requirements), and 6 (Formal Proposal Requirements).  Technical proposals will be accepted until fiscal year 2008 (FY-08) funding for this effort is fully committed.  Offerors are therefore encouraged to submit the technical summary proposal as soon as possible before FY-08 funding is fully committed or exhausted.  Upon request from the FAA, formal technical proposals addressing the research requirements described in section 6 (Formal Proposal Requirements) shall be submitted not more than thirty (30) business days after the date of the request sent by email.  FAA's request will be made via email.   4.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT:  SMALL BUSINESSES SOUGHT FOR PROVIDING DESIGN-BUILD SERVICES IN SUPPORT OF THE IDAHO CLEANUP PROJECT'S SHIELDED CASKS FOR THE REMOTE WASTE DISPOSITION PROJECT. CH2M-WG Idaho, LLC (CWI), is a FAR Based Contractor under contract with the Department of Energy (DOE) to perform cleanup at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) Site near Idaho Falls, Idaho.  CWI is seeking qualified small businesses (NAICS Code 562910, 500 Employee Size Standard) with the knowledge, experience and resources to provide management and execution of design and build turnkey services for three different types of shielded casks for transfer and lag storage of overpack liners containing remote-handled (RH) low-level waste (LLW) and transuranic (TRU) waste contaminated with residual or bulk amounts of elemental sodium (Na) or sodium/potassium (NaK).  Casks must be designed for a 3 ton payload and radiation levels as high as 15,000 R/hr.  Nuclear Regulatory licensing of the casks is not required.  However, the casks must demonstrate containment/confinement during accident conditions including potential drops onto rigid surfaces during transport and handling without the use of impact limiters.  The casks must be qualified for potential drop and impact conditions with dynamic, elastic/plastic analyses that will satisfy the safety basis of the casks and facility.  Considerable quantities of RH waste are stored at the INL Site. In accordance with federal and state legal and regulatory requirements, this waste must be processed and repackaged in preparation for final land disposal. Because capabilities to process RH waste do not currently exist at the INL Site, the Remote-handled Waste Disposition Project (RWDP) has been proposed to provide this capability. The mission of the RWDP is to open, segregate, characterize, treat, repackage, and ship for final disposition RH waste from more than 900 waste liners.*** One type of cask will contain 11.5 inch diameter x 72 inch long waste liner containing the RH waste. *** The second type will handle a variety of  waste liners -16 inch pipe x 12 feet long liners with variable shielding, overpacked again in 24 inch pipe x 13.5 feet long liners.  The waste liners will be transported in these two cask types approximately 23 miles from the waste loading facility to the storage and repackaging facility. *** The third type of cask, facility transfer cask, will handle both sizes of waste packages and is expected to be a bottom loading/unloading cask used for waste liner transfers within the facility and in and out of a hot cell. Conceptual drawings of the three types of casks are attached in Figures 1-3. 

This is a sources sought announcement designed to identify and qualify potential sources interested in this project. This announcement is not a solicitation. Small businesses who submit a qualified response will be maintained on a list as sources for a possible future solicitation. It is anticipated that a request for proposal will be issued by 2009.

Below is a summary of the required EAP Service requirements: Eastern Colorado Healthcare System (ECHCS) - approximately 2000 employees Includes:   Medical Center and Nursing Home, Lakewood CBOC, Fitzsimmons CBOC,  Health Administration Center (HAC) - approximately 700 employees Southern Colorado area (SoCO) - approximately 250 employees.  Includes:   Pueblo Nursing Home, Alamosa CBOC, Colorado Springs CBOC, LaJunta CBOC, Lamar CBOC, Pueblo CBOC, Burlington CBOC and support offices located in La Junta, Las Animas, and Pueblo. A.	Objective of the Employee Assistance Program (EAP):   Provide access to appropriate prevention, treatment and rehabilitation programs and services for employees of the ECHCS and Health Administration Center with alcohol, drug, mental, emotional, family or other personal problems which adversely affect job performance, and to provide guidance for supervisors to effectively handle problems of employees which adversely affect job performance. B.	General Description of Services:   Programs and services will be provided by an independent, local, counseling service for assessment, referral and limited counseling, with costs paid by the ECHCS and the Health Administration Center.  Costs of additional counseling services will be paid by employees or their health insurance providers.  Referrals of employees and/or eligible family members may be self-referral or by any supervisor of the ECHCS or Health Administration Center.   For our Southern Colorado offices, we will not require an on-site counselor, but instead the use of a 1-800 number for employees to call and set up face-to-face meetings with a provider in their area, also including up to six (6) visits per employee.

Supervisors may use the program to refer employees to the program or to obtain guidance when personal problems of subordinate staff cause unsatisfactory job performance.  It is the intent of the program to provide for intervention only when problems affect job performance or reflect discredit to the participating agency. These policies do not alter nor replace any existing administrative policies or contractual agreements of ECHCS or Health Administration Center, but are intended merely to assist ECHCS and Health Administration Center to carry out existing policies.

<CONTACT>Rachel Phelps, 309-782-0281
<DESC>The purpose of this sources sought/market survey is to identify sources capable of manufacturing 20MM M940 Multipurpose Trace Self-Destruct Cartridges, NSN 1305-01-534-2702, Part Number 13011323, DODIC AB07.  The yearly anticipated requirement is 950 ,000 cartridges for FY08 and 300,000 cartridges for FY09.  Special equipment is required to produce these cartridges.  The manufacturing process encompasses, but is not limited to: (1) machining of projectile body metal parts, (2) production of propellant,  (3) cartridge case priming and loading w/propellant, and (4) load, assemble, and pack-out (LAP) of the completed cartridges.  For each step of the manufacturing process, sophisticated test and measuring equipment are required to ensure the final products comply with Government requirements.  Experience in ballistic testing, propellant, and process engineering experience relative to the LAP of these cartridges is essential.  An approved ballistic test range, 20mm single shot test (MANN) barrel(s), and an M1 68 Automatic Gun are required to perform First Article and Lot Acceptance Tests on these cartridges.  Production support equipment includes material handling systems, tool room equipment, furnaces for heat treat and annealing, metal forming and machining e quipment, anodize and phosphate systems, ultrasonic test equipment, and metrology and metallurgy laboratories.  Production of these cartridges is complex and requires sophisticated industrial capabilities.  Obtaining the critical skills, (i.e. ammunition p rocess/design engineers, set-up mechanics and operators familiar with the programming and operation of ammunition component sub-assembly production equipment, quality control engineers, ultrasonic technicians, metallurgists, ballistics test personnel, etc)  needed to manufacture and provide high quality ammunition in a timely manner may take time.  Due to the customers demand for timely deliveries, potential producers must be able to successfully conduct/complete a First Article Acceptance Test within 180 da ys after award, with the first production delivery due within 210 days after award.  A respondents production capacity must be sufficient to manufacture an average of 50,000 cartridges per month.  Interested U.S./Canadian firms who consider themselves capable of manufacturing the M940 cartridge are invited to indicate their interest by providing the Government a brief summary of their companys capabilities, facilities, personnel, and past manufactu ring experience to HQ, ASC; ATTN: AMSAS-ACA-F/ Rachel Phelps, 1 Rock Island Arsenal; Rock Island, IL  61299-6500.  Responses can also be submitted by email to rachel.phelps@us.army.mil.  Please respond no later than November 7, 2007 and identify the 20MM M 940 Sources Sought/Market Research as the subject of your response.  This market survey is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or an obligation on the part of the Government.  The Government does not intend to aw ard a contract based on this market survey or otherwise pay for information solicited.

<SUBJECT>R -- Cobra Dane Radar Support
<DESC>Description:

 The 45th Contracting Squadron intends to negotiate a modification to contract FA2521-06-C-8006 on a sole source basis with Raytheon Technical Services Company, Reston, VA, for Cobra Dane Radar support services as described in this notice. IAW FAR 6.302-1 and pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304( c ) (1), only one responsible source and no other suppliers or services will satisfy the mission critical agency requirements.  The Cobra Dane Radar is being modified by the functional transfer of both software and hardware designed to incorporate Missile Defense mission capability as part of the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) element of the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS).  This radar system of improved specific characteristics has followed the natural progression from Initial Operational Capability (IOC) to Full Operational Capability (FOC).  The work to be accomplished is based upon the transition of Missile Defense mission support requirements from the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) to the Air Force.  

The AN/FPS-108 COBRA DANE is a one-of-a-kind radar system with critical performance characteristics and availability requirements that support three concurrent Air Force missions.  The system operational software consists of approximately 300,000 lines of Raytheon-developed Ada code that control the radar, and approximately 200,000 lines of Raytheon developed C++ code that control the Battle Management Command/Control/Communications (BMC3) Communications Processing Equipment (BCPE). 

The Raytheon developed CDU software is extensively integrated throughout multiple Computer Software Configuration Items (CSCIs) that were also developed by Raytheon under the earlier COBRA DANE System Modernization (CDSM) program.  Effective and efficient maintenance and modification of this system requires first-hand design and maintenance experience with the underlying software algorithms that are used to support all three radar missions.  The contractor is required to execute time-critical software modifications for all radar missions without interference or degradation to any mission.  The contractor is required to devise and conduct the test cases that verify this for every software modification executed.  

Evaluation of the contractor?s unique capability, extensive acquisition history, unparalleled experience with this unique radar system and proven performance as the incumbent Cobra Dane O&M contractor has led to the conclusion that the required specialized support is available from only one source.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541330. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, the government will consider any responses from capable sources received within 15 days after publication of this synopsis.  This requirement is for the Air Force Technical Applications Center (AFTAC).  Phone calls will not be accepted.  No solicitation documents exist.

The clause at Air Force Federal Acquisition Regulation (AFFARS) 5352.201-9101, Ombudsman, is applicable to this request.  In accordance with AFFARS 5301.9103, the first sentence of clause 5352.201-9101 paragraph ( c ) is tailored to read: If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Air Force Space Command ombudsmen, (HQ AFSPC/A7K, 150 Vandenberg St., Ste 1105, Peterson AFB, CO 80914-4350, 719-554-5250, FAX 719-554-5299, a7k.wf@afspc.af.mil.

- OMB Circular A-130, Security of Federal Automated Information Resources
- M-03-18 OMB memorandum for Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies
- Implementation Guidance for the E-Government Act of 2002

OBJECTIVE

GSA is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) in order to gain a better understanding of the commercial practices that govern information security and the safeguarding of personally identifiable information (PII) and protected health information (PHI).

INFORMATION SOUGHT

GSA has developed a proposed catalog of commercial services that assist agencies in complying with the regulations and laws outlined above (see Background).  The following services are intended to focus on total solutions rather than individual disciplines:

Credit Monitoring Services:  Services include the full range of credit monitoring services, from basic to comprehensive. The tasks involved in credit monitoring services include but are not limited to the following:
- Monitoring of all three national credit bureau reports 
- Monitoring of a single national credit bureau report 
- Fraud alerts
- Monitoring of credit information in order to detect early signs of fraudulent activity and identity theft
- Customer care
- Identity theft insurance (as allowed by applicable State statutes)
- Fraud resolution and assistance for affected individuals  
- Credit risk assessments
- Credit freeze
- Social Security Number monitoring
- Credit card monitoring  

Independent Risk Analysis Services:  Services include a review of all PII and/or PHI compromised by a data breach for trends and unusual patterns.  The circumstances surrounding the breach are investigated to determine whether it appears to be incidental, accidental or targeted.  The breached data itself is analyzed to determine if there is any current evidence of organized misuse.  The analysis will ultimately provide a determination as to the probability that breached data may be used to harm the individuals whose data has been compromised. The tasks involved in independent risk analysis include but are not limited to the following:
- Metadata analysis 
- Pattern analysis
- Risk analysis 
- Data breach analysis and response 
- Privacy impact analysis 
- Statistical analysis
- Data structure development
- Probability analysis that breached data has been used to cause harm
- Determining the level of risk for potential misuse of sensitive information
- Certification of opinion regarding misuse of compromised data
- Investigation of circumstances surrounding breach
- Development of a risk mitigation plan

Independent Validation and Verification (IV&V) Services:  Services include third party testing critical to the detection and elimination of defects, before users ever experience them.  The validation of technologies, programs, and processes for the safeguarding of PII and PHI.  The verification component tests technologies, programs, and processes to ensure they work as intended and expected in safeguarding PII and PHI.   Creation of compliance privacy policies and safeguarding guidelines and processes, planning and implementation, education on regulatory compliance, risk management, cost/benefit reviews, and the exploration of verification and authentication strategies and technologies for the safeguarding of PII and PHI.  
Accreditation and Certification Services:  Services include assessment of the effectiveness and readiness of critical of technologies, programs, and processes needed to safeguard PII and PHI, evaluation of functions and continuous monitoring that assesses a subset of the management, operational, and technical controls used to safeguard information, baseline analysis and documentation of existing infrastructure, policies, and procedures needed to safeguard PII and PHI, and analysis of vulnerabilities and the metrics to measure risks associated with safeguarding PII and PHI.  It also includes the review of current privacy policies and safeguarding guidelines, maintenance and demonstration of compliance, review of regulatory impact on administrative, technical, and physical safeguarding of PII and PHI.  

Data Breach Analysis Services:  Data breach analysis looks across multiple industries to detect patterns of misuse related to a specific data loss.  The breached file is continuously monitored over a period of weeks, months, or years.  Data breach analysis can distinguish misuse resulting from a breach from misuse due to other reasons.  It can provide the locations of potential misuse for further law enforcement action.  It can also provide a listing of consumers likely to be fraud victims.

Description of requirement for the services to be acquired:


FURNITURE MAINTENANCE SERVICES
Statement of Work (SOW)


1.0	Background:

DFAS Columbus utilizes Steelcase ?Context? systems furniture installed approximately 10 years ago.   In addition to the systems furniture there are offices constructed using movable Clerestory walls, as well as UNICOR furniture and limited quantities of other brands.   Movement of other furniture would only be as a result of an overall Steelcase furniture move.  Approximately 3,900 work stations are located in Columbus ranging in size from 6 x 6 work stations to 240 square foot walled offices.  The furniture is located in a 7 story building located on the Defense Supply Center Columbus base.  DFAS Columbus continues to be a dynamic organization with reorganizations and changing requirements that require reconfigurations and movement of furniture often with short turnaround times.

2.0	Objective/Scope of Work:

The purpose of this requirement is to provide a comprehensive furniture movement and maintenance program that includes all labor, equipment and supervision necessary to facilitate the evaluation, design, disassembly, movement, storage, inventory, reassembly and maintenance of furniture located at DFAS Columbus.  The contractor is required to be familiar with Steelcase furniture and installation, and have the ability to obtain Steelcase parts and pieces that may be required to fit existing furniture at a new location.  Orders for services will be issued on an as needed basis. 



3.0	Requirements/Tasks:

The contractor shall perform the following tasks:

3.1  The contractor?s move management service shall provide complete coordination of all furniture moves to include initial walkthroughs, drawing approvals, scheduling of installation crews, project updates, and project completion inspection and approvals.  

3.2  The government will provide copies of all available building drawings of the area(s) to be moved or refit with furniture.  These drawings will be best available drawings of the space, including potential locations of electrical hook-ups.  If a particular move involves furniture other than Steelcase, the contractor shall develop existing drawings based on the workstation standards of the particular manufacturer.  The contractor will verify field measurements and develop new floor plans by area.  The new floor plans will consist of existing typical work stations.  Typical workstation cluster interior components, i.e., work surfaces, overhead units, storage, etc., can change, providing they are not panel dependent, or the panel dimension will support the different workstation configuration.

3.3	Inventory and Storage:

3.3.1  Should the movement require interim storage, the contractor shall adequately protect all fabric-covered items.  All warehoused items will be separated by cardboard, but not necessarily individually cartoned. 

3.3.2  The contractor shall provide an inventory list of the items to be placed in storage.  As items are pulled and removed from storage, the contractor shall provide a separate list for those items and update inventory listings.   

3.3.3  The contractor shall perform an inventory of parts and pieces as requested by the government to determine the type and number of work stations that can be constructed from the parts and pieces in storage.

3.4   Following a request for furniture movement, an inventory of the existing panels and connectors will be taken by the contractor in each cluster to be moved in order to ensure they are reinstalled correctly.  The storage inventory will be reviewed for any needed parts and pieces required to fit the workstation at the new location.  Any missing components, including modifications to the wiring system and/or preset locations, will be identified by the contractor to the contracting officer?s representative in writing so acquisition of these components by the contractor or the government can be accomplished.  Once the new drawings are approved, a schedule for tear down and reinstallation will be established with the contractor?s project manager and the contracting officer or designated representative.  Workstations will then be reinstalled accordingly.   No work shall be performed until the government has approved the schedule, drawings and quote.

3.5  It is understood that the reconfiguration of furniture may result in damaged or inoperative wire and power management systems.  It is the intention of the government to retrofit this older furniture during the reconfigurations to mate to the cellular deck wiring system and presets or to the available wiring systems in the other buildings to the maximum extent possible to standardize the wire management system in DFAS occupied areas.  The contractor will be required to provide new and replacement parts for the furniture located in all DFAS occupied areas, as directed by the contracting officer.  This includes Steelcase and other brands as identified above.  The government may elect to provide the contractor with components from other brands for contractor installation.

3.6   The government will clean the area and the location will be free of debris prior to installation.  The government, before dismantling of furniture systems, will disconnect all electrical connections to the building source.  The contractor shall be responsible for the disconnecting of electrical wiring within the systems furniture.  All data and communications cabling will be removed from the systems furniture before dismantling, and reinstalled in the new location by the government.  All workstation contents including files, paper, binders, personal items, electronic equipment, phones, etc., will be removed from the area by the government before the disassembly begins.

3.7  A pre-disassembly inspection walk-through with the contractor and the government will take place to determine the condition of the product and findings shall be annotated.

3.8 The project will be considered complete when the furniture is completely reassembled, the internal electrical system has been connected, all debris created by the contractor is removed and final inspection of the required work is complete.  Final connection to the building source is the responsibility of the government; however, testing of the internal wiring system is the contractor?s responsibility.

3.9 Furniture Repair and Touch-up:

3.9.1  The contractor shall protect new fabric furniture through the application of stain protection treatments, as directed by the contracting officer?s representative.  Fabric protection chemicals may be applied in unoccupied areas during normal business hours, however, in occupied areas it must be applied after hours.  MSDS sheets are required.

3.9.2   The contractor, as directed by the contracting officer, shall extend the life and improve the appearance of wooden furniture.  This shall be accomplished through repair and wood/steel touch-up, to restore an item to at least 80% (or as agreed upon between the contractor and the contracting officer), of its original condition by toning, applying surface filler, and using the proper finish to match the existing piece.  Each item will be addressed on an individual basis and all expectations will be agreed upon before the process begins.

3.10  The contractor shall protect adjacent surfaces while work is in progress.  The contractor shall repair and/or clean all damaged or soiled surfaces.

3.11  The work will be performed during normal business hours of Monday through Friday; 7:00 AM to 4:00 PM unless directed to be performed after duty hours.  Loading dock access will be provided.

Prices.    Offerors shall submit pricing for the item(s) listed in the Section B as well as price the sample order provided in the solicitation.

<DESC>The purpose of this synopsis is to notify industry that a Sole Source Fixed Price Contract is intended to be awarded to Jay Robinson Racing, LLC under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1. The United States Customs and Border Protection Office of Border Patrol has a requirement to enter into a sponsorship agreement for the 2008 racing season with the owner of the rights to the #28 NASCAR Busch Series race car as part of an ongoing recruitment advertising campaign. May 28, 1924 is the date of the founding of the U.S. Border Patrol. Throughout its existence, the Border Patrol has associated the number 28 with the start of its mission to protect the borders, beginning in El Paso, TX. The number 28 symbolizes the diligence and dedication demonstrated by thousands of agents over the years, including those who have fallen in the line of duty, protecting the United States. Accordingly, given the U.S. Customs and Border Protection requirement to sponsor a Busch Series race car for purposes of recruitment, the #28 car is a unique source to recruit and retain agents.  In 2007, agents have been pictured with the #28 car in many national and regional front- page newspaper articles, and the Office of Border Patrol #28 car has been seen on syndicated and national television programming.  The Office of Border Patrol is approximately halfway through an advertising campaign featuring the #28 Busch Series car.  Jay Robinson Racing LLC currently owns the rights to the #28 Busch Series car and is therefore the only source available at this time for satisfying the Government's NASCAR viewer recruitment initiative.

<DESC>Amendment 0001 is issued to respond to the following question received:

Question:  Can you confirm that the T53-L-703 engine you have for exchange is in running condition? In other words the engine cannot be crashed, over sped, over torque or running hot. The fact that the engine does not have history on the rotating components is not as big a deal to me, but whether or not the engine is in running condition affects how I will quote.

Response:  The engine is currently fully functioning on wing.  There is no time and cycle history for the turbines and compressor.

There are no other changes.

1.  	Question:  Security Requirements
	
	In the proposal, I see the Security requirements do not state you have to have a Facility Clearance at the time of submittal.  Are you willing to sponsor a clearance at the time of award? 

	
	Answer:

            Solicitation states that ?Contracting Facility and personnel working on contract providing instruction must have a Secret security clearance.?  Contracting facility must meet all local, state, and federal/industry requirements for instruction in Law Enforcement and Force Protection guidelines and hold federal firearms license and certified firearm ranges at time of award.

(2)  QUALITY ASSURANCE SURVEILLANCE PLAN
	(a)  Introduction 
This Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) was developed to evaluate Contractor actions while implementing this Performance-Based Work Statement. It is designed to provide an effective surveillance method of monitoring Contractor performance for each listed objective. 
This QASP is based on the premise that the Government desires to maintain a quality standard in the provision of all necessary supplies and services to ensure a successful conference. 
The Contractor, and not the Government, is responsible for all management and quality control actions to meet the terms of the contract. The role of the Government is to monitor quality assurance to ensure all contract standards are achieved. 
In this contract the quality control program is the driver for product quality. Under the terms of the contract, the Contractor is required to develop a comprehensive program of self inspections and self monitoring of its actions. The first major step to ensuring a "self-correcting" contract is to ensure that the quality control program approved at the beginning of the contract provides the measures needed to lead the Contractor to success. 
Once the quality control program is approved by OPM, careful application of the process and standards presented in the remainder of this document will ensure a robust assurance program.

	
(b)  Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan

REQUIRED SERVICE	PERFORMANCE STANDARD	METHOD OF SURVEILLANCE	INCENTIVE/DISINCENTIVE
Timeliness	All products, services and items shall be delivered within established timeframes	Visual	Incentive: Outstanding performance rating
Disincentive: OPM elects not to consider contractor for future requirements
Consistency to Requirements	All products, services and items shall satisfy the requirements of the contract/order	Visual	Incentive: Outstanding performance rating
Disincentive: OPM elects not to consider contractor for future requirements

Surveillance and Monitoring; An agency representative will monitor performance by a system of inspection and random sampling, any complaints received from OPM personnel will be passed on to the Contractor for correction.

DOCUMENT CONTINUED - Due to space limitations OF A combined synopsis/solicitations in FedBizOpps this DOCUMENT is CONTINUED ON SEPARATE AMENDMENTS ? PARAGRAPHS CONTINUED ON AMENDMENT 1,     (ALL FAR AND OPM CLAUSES) ON AMENDMENT 2 and AMENDMENT 3 (OPM CLAUSES CONTINUED) (2)  QUALITY ASSURANCE SURVEILLANCE PLAN
	(a)  Introduction 
This Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) was developed to evaluate Contractor actions while implementing this Performance-Based Work Statement. It is designed to provide an effective surveillance method of monitoring Contractor performance for each listed objective. 
This QASP is based on the premise that the Government desires to maintain a quality standard in the provision of all necessary supplies and services to ensure a successful conference. 
The Contractor, and not the Government, is responsible for all management and quality control actions to meet the terms of the contract. The role of the Government is to monitor quality assurance to ensure all contract standards are achieved. 
In this contract the quality control program is the driver for product quality. Under the terms of the contract, the Contractor is required to develop a comprehensive program of self inspections and self monitoring of its actions. The first major step to ensuring a "self-correcting" contract is to ensure that the quality control program approved at the beginning of the contract provides the measures needed to lead the Contractor to success. 
Once the quality control program is approved by OPM, careful application of the process and standards presented in the remainder of this document will ensure a robust assurance program.
