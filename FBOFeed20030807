Box 4138, Rapid City, South Dakota 57709. The period of performance is from date of award to February 1, 2004. SAMHSA has long recognized the effects of types of post-traumatic trauma on individuals in the healing and recovery stages of treatment of substance use and mental health disorders. Recognizing and addressing the symptoms of stress and trauma in treating substance use or mental health disorders is critical in meeting the treatment needs of the individual.  Since the traumatic national events of September 11, 2001, the focus on addressing these issues as part of the healing and recovery process has taken on increasing importance.  This acquisition is to support the AModels for Healing Indigenous Survivors of Historical Trauma@ Mini Conference to be held at the Santa Ana Tribal Reservation.  This conference shall address the events of 9/11 and the threats of bioterrorism in uncertain times, and their impact upon designing and delivering effective healing interventions. For many historically traumatized populations, such recent events and threats may trigger specific trauma reactions and associations. Specific treatment implications are addressed in response to these reactions.  It is anticipated that approximately 150 persons will attend this mini conference and planning session. The Contractor shall plan (with SAMHSA/CSAT involvement) and implement the conference, provide a summary report describing the successes and weaknesses of the conference, and recommend next steps in training the TASC field. THE PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION IS FOR SERVICES FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO SOLICIT AND NEGOTIATE WITH ONLY ONE SOURCE UNDER AUTHORITY OF FAR 6.302.  INTERESTED PERSONS MAY IDENTIFY THEIR INTEREST BY RESPONDING TO THE REQUIREMENT WITHIN 10 DAYS AFTER THE DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THIS NOTICE .  A DETERMINATION BY THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO COMPETE THIS PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION BASED UPON RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE IS SOLELY WITHIN THE DISCRETION OF THE GOVERNMENT.  INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL NORMALLY BE CONSIDERED SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING WHETHER TO CONDUCT A COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT. NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, PLEASE CONTACT JULIA SAVOY IN ROOM. 5-101, PARKLAWN BUILDING, 5600 FISHERS LANE ROCKVILLE, MARYLAND 20857, OR ON 301-443-2475.

Interested parties are responsible from obtaining the draft statement of objectives via http://www.govworks.gov/vendor/csolicit.asp.  Also, interested parties may learn more about the National Youth Anti Drug Media Campaign by visiting www.mediacampaign.org. This competitive process will be simplified in order to facilitate the acquisition process and prevent undue administrative burden upon the Contractor(s) and the Government.  In order to compete for this acquisition interested parties must demonstrate that they are qualified to perform the work by submitting a Capabilities Statement both in hard-copy and electronic-copy. The hard-copy must be not more than 30 pages, and in a font size not smaller than 12. The electronic copy must be readable in Microsoft Word. Both versions of the Capabilities Statement must be received by the Contracting Officer no later than 3:00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time, September 8, 2003. Please note: Interested Parties must ensure that their submission is received by the person, time, and date specified herein. The Government will use the Capabilities Statements to assess the experience and capability of each interested party and its relevant personnel.  Each Capabilities Statement received will be reviewed and evaluated by the Government.  The evaluation consists of a review of four criteria. Each of the criterion, 1 though 4, are of equal importance: (1) Provide a Curriculum Vitae for each of your key personnel and program manager (those who would have primary responsibility for performing and/or managing the work at minimum half time) who will perform the necessary services. Describe the specific success and experience each individual has with building public/private partnerships that generate changes in public health or behavior, corporate relations, marketing, and brand management (2) Describe the experience your organization has with implementing and executing corporate involvement in public health campaigns or government programs. References former and current clients (including type of relation, dates of service, names, titles, and telephone numbers) (3) Describe the impact of that corporate involvement, and provide specific examples of how the impact was measured, and how the impact supported the mission of the client and the other entity, and; (4) Demonstrate that your organization is able to work in a rapidly changing environment with shifting priorities and budgets, and its ability to obtain specialized resources when needed, its willingness to provide robust solutions, compliance with the terms of contracts, and delivery and acceptability of products and services rendered. If the Government might find adverse information as a result of checking your organization's past performance record, please provide an explanation and any remedial action your organization took to address the problem. After review of all Capabilities Statements, only those parties deemed "Best Qualified" will be invited to continue the acquisition process. Those selected will be given additional instructions, the full solicitation package and will be asked to submit a proposal.

<CONTACT>Lawrence Carter Contracting Officer's Rep. 5205331213     lawrence.carter@hua.army.mil;
<DESC><BR> 1.  INTRODUCTION:<BR> The National Business Center, acting as the contract agent for the Advanced Research and Development Activity in Information Technology (ARDA), is soliciting proposals for Phase 2 of the AQUAINT (Advanced Question Answering for Intelligence) Program.  ARDA (<A HREF=http://www.ic-arda.org/>http://www.ic-arda.org/</A>) is a research organization jointly established in December 1998 by the Department of Defense and the U.S. Intelligence Community.  While the ARDA office is organizationally part of the National Security Agency, ARDA's mission is to incubate revolutionary Research and Development (R&D) activities within the broad field of Information Technology.  ARDA's individual research programs are organized around broad research topics called "Research Thrusts".  One of these Research Thrusts is Information Exploitation and one of the research programs under this Thrust is the AQUAINT Advanced R&D Program.   <BR> 2.  AQUAINT PROGRAM GOALS:<BR> Phase 2 of the AQUAINT Program is the next two-year effort in the six-year question-answering (Q&A) program; it will be initiated at the end of  2003/early 2004 and run through the end of 2005/early 2006.  The AQUAINT Program seeks proposals for innovative, creative, and high-risk research, continuing to advance the state-of-the-art in technologies and methods for advanced, automated question answering.  <BR> The overall AQUAINT Program goal is to explore and develop innovative technical designs, algorithms, methods, processes, technologies or techniques with the potential of significantly advancing, directly and materially, one or more of the following facets of question answering:<BR> * Accept complex "Questions" in a form natural to an information analyst<BR> * Translate these questions into multiple queries appropriate to the multiple data sources to be searched and to the analyst's information-gathering task<BR> * Find relevant information in multiple, disparate data sources<BR> * Integrate features of the analyst's larger information-gathering task into the information identification process to help define what constitutes an adequate answer<BR> * Analyze, fuse, evaluate and summarize the relevant information extracted or otherwise derived from these multiple data sources into a coherent answer<BR> * Provide access to related, adjunct information uncovered in the process of searching for answers to specific questions<BR> * Provide an answer back to the information analyst in a form natural to and preferred by him or her in a timely fashion<BR> 2.1. Phase 1 Research Goals and Accomplishments:<BR> The Phase 1 technical goals focused on the following three Functional Components and Enabling Technologies in support of the AQUAINT Program goals: <BR> 1. Question Understanding and Interpretation<BR> 2. Determining the Answer<BR> 3. Formulating and Presenting the Answer<BR> 	And/Or <BR> Cross-Cutting/Enabling/Enhancing Technologies directly and materially supporting the goals of the AQUAINT Program and one or more of the areas 1 to 3 listed above. <BR> 2.2. Phase 2 Research Goals:<BR> During the life of the AQUAINT Program, advances are expected to demonstrate significant increases in capability over existing technologies and over the successes of previous phases of the Program.  Therefore, in addition to pursuing the goals identified in Phase 1 of the Program, Phase 2 will encourage efforts, which focus on the following challenges:<BR> * Question Answering as Part of a Larger Information-Gathering Process<BR> * Accessing, Retrieving and Integrating Diverse Data Sources<BR> * Exploring Boundaries / Combinations of Knowledge-based, Statistical and Linguistic Approaches to Question Answering<BR> * Evaluating, Validating and Presenting an Answer <BR> 2.2.1. Question Answering as Part of a Larger Information-Gathering Process.<BR> During Phase 2, the AQUAINT Program seeks to focus on the development of algorithms and methods addressing question answering as a cooperative, information-gathering process between a user and the system.  In standard interactions, questions are rarely asked in isolation; instead, they are linked to a larger information need and sequenced to explore an information space.  The information need helps to define how a question should be interpreted and what information would be considered adequate as an answer.  The question and anticipated answer in a cooperative environment are:<BR> * Conditioned by a knowledge frame, which the analyst brings to the interaction; <BR> * Associated with a larger information-gathering task;<BR> * Shaped by previous questions and by additional topic-related information; and<BR> * Influenced by an analyst's expectations about the format, content, reliability of an answer to the question.  <BR> The AQUAINT Program would expect, in the end, an advanced Q&A system able to generalize larger information-gathering tasks, anticipating the sorts of information which might be useful for such tasks; would decompose a less predictable task; would establish an extended interactive session to refine the task, and would identify domains of knowledge which the analyst brings to the task.  An interactive session with the analyst would validate the system's understanding of the analysts' information needs, the scope of relevant information, additional paths of inquiry and the analyst's expectations about the adequacy, extent and format of the answer.  Such knowledge of the context would then serve as a resource for selecting suitable retrieval strategies and for assigning value to the data discovered. <BR> 2.2.2. Accessing, Retrieving and Integrating Multiple, Diverse Data Sources.<BR> Rarely are the sources of information relevant to questions about global topics of one homogeneous type.  Relevant information can be found in highly diverse and extremely large repositories of unstructured text; knowledge bases; structured databases; Web pages and other HTML and XML tagged documents; document images (e.g., scanned or faxed documents); voice recordings; images (both still and video); and other multi-media data objects.  The data sources of interest to the Program should be viewed as widely distributed and subject to frequent and significant fluctuations in size and to continual updates in content.   <BR> In addition to the diversity in the types of data, the human language content of these data sources can vary dramatically.  Sources may be expressed in English but, more and more frequently, material is found in a foreign language or in multiple foreign languages, in a variety of scripts, a range of fonts, a multitude of formats. <BR> An advanced Q&A system will be able to address the broad range of data and language types, accessing and manipulating them and integrating answers or pieces of answers from these diverse sources into a cohesive response to a question.   <BR> 2.2.3. Exploring Boundaries / Combinations of Knowledge-based, Statistical and Linguistic Approaches to Question Answering.<BR> Prior to and during Phase 1 of the AQUAINT Program, most question answering systems focused primarily on one technical approach, emphasizing knowledge-based reasoning, statistical, or linguistic techniques and theories.  As the AQUAINT Program progresses and the question answering tasks become broader and more complex, it is unlikely that any one single approach will be able to handle all of the AQUAINT Program requirements for advanced question answering.  In particular, we believe that three areas warrant additional attention. <BR> * We believe there are a number of challenging/unsolved problems involving knowledge acquisition, learning, representation and maintenance within an advanced question answering system as well as problems involving significantly more advanced and broadly applicable reasoning, influence and machine learning that builds on and utilizes these more expansive and comprehensive knowledge sources. <BR> * There are a number of challenging/unsolved problems whose solution might involve a combination of multiple approaches (e.g., decomposing complex questions into a series/sequence of simpler questions whose answers can be found; selecting the appropriate sources to search; giving understandable explanations of the "Plan", the "Reasoning Used" and the "Answers Found"). <BR> * Finally, each of the single disciplinary approaches has unique strengths and weaknesses.  Fortunately for advanced question answering, they have significant areas where the strengths of one approach match up against weaknesses of another approach.  The AQUAINT Program wishes to explore more fully and investigate the potential power gained by combined multiple approaches into a single advanced question answering system. <BR> 2.2.4. Evaluating, Validating and Presenting an Answer.<BR> Important progress has been made on formulating and presenting a natural-language answer to a question.  Presentation of documents or document snippets containing the answer is giving way to formulation of appropriate answers in the form of well formed, natural-language sentences, lists, descriptions and so forth.   <BR> Continued movement toward enhanced answer formulation will also depend on being able to generate answers to questions in a form natural to the information analyst when the answer is found in multiple documents, in different formats, in various media, in multiple languages and in varying styles. <BR> Not only is it important for advanced Q&A systems to be able to present information appropriately but the system must also be able to assess the likely relevance, value and reliability of the information.  Reliability indices will also address the challenges of identifying when data are missing from the sources searched, when information is likely to be false and when no on-topic information was discovered.   <BR> 3. SCOPE:<BR> The AQUAINT Program is a 24-month program, open to all research and development organizations located in the U.S., including large and small businesses; academic and eligible non-profit and not-for-profit institutions; collaborative ventures from mixed sources; and Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs).  All AQUAINT Program Phase 1 participants must submit proposals in response to this BAA to be selected for award under Phase 2. <BR> Funding for Phase 2 of the AQUAINT Program will utilize funds from FY 2004-2006 and is anticipated to total $22,000,000.  The Government anticipates funding approximately 15-20 proposals at varying levels of effort ranging from highly focused studies utilizing 1 to 1 1/2 FTE researchers/investigators and aimed at a single, key technical sub-problem to component / system-level investigations utilizing three to four FTE researchers / investigators seeking to address larger, more comprehensive, component wide and/or end-to-end question and answering issues.  It is anticipated any resultant contract(s) will be funded for two years, with each year's level approximately $200,000 to $300,000 for a highly focused study up through $600,000 to $900,000 for a more comprehensive component / system level effort.  Please note this is an approximation only and the cost proposal should reflect the realistic cost of the proposed work. <BR> Information in this BAA is supplemented by a Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) providing further information on the eligibility, support, research areas, multidisciplinary approaches, preparation and submission of proposals, and selection criteria.  It is available at <A HREF=http://www.nbc.gov/acquaint.cfm>http://www.nbc.gov/acquaint.cfm</A>.  This pamphlet may also be obtained by fax, electronic mail, or official mail.  Send requests for PIP to the Department of Interior, Fort Huachuca by email to <A HREF=mailto:Lawrence_H_Carter@nbc.gov>Lawrence_H_Carter@nbc.gov</A> or call 520-533-1213. <BR> This Broad Agency Announcement constitutes the entire solicitation for this effort. No additional information (beyond the PIP) is available, nor will a formal request for proposal or other solicitation regarding this notice be issued, requests for the same will be disregarded. <BR> 4.

Confidentiality and Security Requirements:  
  
a. 	The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data being provided under this contract were collected by the BLS under a pledge of confidentiality for exclusively statistical purposes.  Therefore, the Contractor and its employees must handle the BLS data in accordance with Section 512 of the Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act of 2002 (CIPSEA) (Title 5 of Public Law 107-347) and other applicable Federal laws.  As designated agents of the BLS, all Contractor employees are subject to the fines and penalties under Section 513 of CIPSEA and any other fines and penalties that apply to the willful mishandling of confidential information.  The Confidential Information Protection provisions of CIPSEA appear as Exhibit A of this contract.  
  
b. 	The BLS policy on confidentiality is stated in Commissioner's Order No. 3-93, dated August 18, 1993, entitled "Confidential Nature of BLS Records."  This document appears as Exhibit B, and is incorporated into this contract.  It is applicable to the Contractor and the Contractor's employees.  The majority of data collected by BLS are provided on a voluntary basis by respondents who have agreed to provide the information for the statistical purpose(s) specified by the BLS.  A violation of the confidence that respondents place in the BLS would endanger the BLS' ability to carry out its duties.  
  
c. 	For the purposes of this contract, "confidential information" includes:  
  
	(1)	Individually identifiable data.  Any representation of information that permits the identity of participants in BLS statistical programs to be reasonably inferred by either direct or indirect means.  
  
	(2) 	Pre-release economic data.  Statistics and analyses that have not yet been cleared for release (that is, have not yet been officially released to the public), including but not limited to those that have a set date and time of release before which they must not be divulged.  
  
	(3) 	Embargoed data.  Pre-release economic series data for the Principal Federal Economic Indicators produced by the BLS.  Currently, the following BLS data series have been designated by the Office of Management and Budget as Principal Federal Economic Indicators:  the Consumer Price Index, Employment Situation, Employment Cost Index, Producer Price Indexes, Productivity and Costs, Real Earnings, and U.S. Import and Export Price Indexes.  
  
d.	In performing work under this contract, the Contractor agrees that access to the confidential information will be restricted to authorized persons.  For the purposes of this contract, "authorized persons" is defined as:  individuals designated as agents of the BLS who are authorized access to the confidential information for the statistical purposes set out under this contract and have signed a BLS Agent Agreement (Exhibit C) swearing to comply with CIPSEA and other applicable Federal laws in the handling of confidential BLS information.  The Contractor will forward all signed Agent Agreements to the Contracting Officers Technical Representative (COTR) prior to receiving access to the confidential information.    
  
e.	All agents will perform activities subject to this contract under the control of the COTR or any other BLS official that the BLS designates.  The BLS will notify the Contractor of any such designations.  
  
f.	All agents must agree, in writing, to comply with all provisions of law that affect information acquired by the BLS including, among other laws, the Trade Secrets Act and the Privacy Act.  They must specifically swear to comply with the provisions of Section 512 of CIPSEA.  Agents who improperly disclose confidential information may be subject to criminal sanctions.  
  
g.	Contractor personnel who have access to embargoed data are prohibited from releasing the data to unauthorized persons or gaining financially from knowledge of the data.  It would be a violation of this contract for contractor personnel to:  
  
(1)	use knowledge of embargoed data to buy or sell stocks, mutual funds, bonds, or futures, or to make other similar investments; or  
  
(2)	disclose embargoed data to other persons, or advise or make recommendations to other persons based on knowledge of embargoed data.  
  
h.	The Contractor must provide the COTR a list of all work site(s) at the start of work provided for in this contract and subsequent task orders, and must notify the COTR of any changes (additions or deletions) to the list of work site(s).  All work provided for under this contract will be performed at those locations only.  The Contractor agrees not to remove any tape, compact disk, diskette, or other media containing the confidential information from the listed work sites(s).  
  
i.	The Contractor agrees not to divulge, publish, reproduce, or otherwise disclose, orally or in writing, the confidential information, in whole or in part, to any individual other than authorized persons.  
  
j.	The Contractor agrees not to attempt to link the confidential information with individually identifiable records from any BLS or non-BLS data set.  
  
k.	The Contractor agrees to notify the COTR immediately upon discovering:  
  
	(1)  any breach or suspected breach of security, or   
  
	(2)  any disclosure of the confidential information.  
  
l.	The Contractor agrees to notify the COTR immediately upon receipt of any legal, investigatory, or other demand for access to the confidential information in any form.  
  
m.	The Contractor agrees not to subcontract or transfer any work in the performance of the contract unless specified in this contract or upon prior written approval of the COTR.  
  
n.	The Contractor agrees to include these provisions in all subcontracts awarded, pursuant to this contract, that involve the disclosure of any confidential BLS information orally, in writing, or in any other form, in whole or in part, to the subcontractor.  
  
o.	The Contractor agrees to obtain the written authorization of the COTR to use any courier service(s) not expressly provided for in this contract.  
  
p.	Upon termination or completion of the contract, or at an earlier time if required by the COTR, all source documents or other media provided to the Contractor by BLS and any documents or other media created by the Contractor that contain confidential information must be returned to the COTR, or with the COTRs permission, be destroyed.  The Contractor's failure to surrender or destroy such materials promptly or the Contractor's conversion of such materials to a use not authorized by the contract may be a violation of 18 U.S.C. Section 641.  
  
q.	The Contractor agrees to implement safeguards to prevent unauthorized access, by electronic or physical means, to the confidential information.  The confidential information may be copied to and stored on a network server, a mainframe computer, or the storage device of a personal computer or other device, and may be accessed by modem or other electronic communication device provided that they can be password protected to prevent unauthorized access.  The confidential information may not be accessed by an electronic communication service, such as the Internet.  The confidential information may not be accessed by modem or other electronic communication device from a location other than the work site(s) specified in accordance with paragraph h of this section.  
  
r.	The Contractor agrees to maintain secure work sites within the approved facilities for performance of work under this contract.  The confidential information shall be secured in a manner so that it cannot be viewed by, and it is not accessible to, persons who have not been designated as agents of the BLS and who have not signed a BLS Agent Agreement.  
  
s.	BLS reserves the right to review and approve or disapprove all the security safeguards instituted to comply with the requirements of this contract.  BLS also reserves the right to make unannounced inspections of the Contractor's facilities to determine compliance with the requirements.  
  
t.	The Contractor agrees to assign overall responsibility for the security of all source documents and other media used in performing the work provided for in this contract to a specific officer or employee.  The Contractor shall provide the COTR with the name, address, and phone number of this person and any changes thereto.  
  
u.	The Contractor agrees, in the performance of this contract, to screen employees and to use only those employees who have a demonstrated record of honesty, trustworthiness, integrity, and reliability as ascertained by the Contractor.  
  
v.	All Contractor personnel selected to work under this contract shall be subject to any United States Office of Personnel Management (OPM) background investigation(s) deemed appropriate by BLS, including a National Agency Check and Inquiry (NACI) or higher level of investigation.  BLS will pay all costs directly related to the background investigation(s), and will arrange for the conduct of, and payment for, the investigation(s).  Contractor personnel may be required to complete forms and be fingerprinted for the OPM investigations.  Such investigation(s) may be conducted at any time during the existence of the contract.  If there are questions concerning the suitability (as defined in the Office of Personnel Management, Federal Personnel Manual Chapter 731, Subchapter 3) of an individual following such background investigation(s), notification and an opportunity to respond will be provided to the individual.  If the individual is found to be unsuitable, BLS reserves the right to require the Contractor to remove and/or replace said individual from his/her duties under the contract.  Such removal and/or replacement shall not alter or affect the responsibility of the Contractor to meet the performance standards prescribed in this contract.  In the absence of a written waiver by contract personnel, the provisions of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a) may preclude discussion with the Contractor of the details of the background investigation(s) and/or BLS action.  
  
w.	If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements contained in these clauses, the Contractor shall be deemed to have failed to perform the provision of this contract within the meaning of the default clauses and the contract shall be subject to termination for default.  
  
x.	In accordance with contract provisions, this contract may be formally modified by BLS if a requirement of the courts (e.g., grand jury investigations), a statutory requirement (e.g., civil investigative demands), or other circumstances dictate such a modification.  


BLS AGENT AGREEMENT  
  
PURPOSE.  The purpose of this Agreement is to inform persons who may have access to confidential Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) records of their responsibility for complying with the Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act and other applicable Federal laws and with the confidentiality policies of the BLS.  
  
BACKGROUND.  The BLS of the Department of Labor is the Government's principal fact-finding agency in the field of labor economics.  The majority of the data collected by the BLS are provided on a voluntary basis by respondents who have agreed to provide the information for the purpose(s) specified by the BLS.  A violation of the confidence that respondents place in the BLS would endanger the ability of the BLS to carry out its duties.  Confidential information includes all names, addresses, and other information for units in BLS samples, all identifiable respondent submissions, and any other information in any medium and format that would reasonably disclose the identity by either direct or indirect means of any participant in a statistical program conducted under the auspices of the BLS.  
  
The Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act (CIPSEA) of 2002 (Title V of Public Law 107-347) requires that information acquired by the BLS under a pledge of confidentiality for exclusively statistical purposes shall be used by BLS officers, employees, and agents for statistical purposes only.  CIPSEA further authorizes the BLS to designate individuals who are self-employed researchers, consultants, contractors, and the employees of contractors, with whom contracts or other appropriate agreements are executed, as agents to perform exclusively statistical activities under the control of the BLS.  All designated agents are subject to the fines and penalties under Section 513 of CIPSEA for any willful and knowing disclosure of confidential information.  
  
Further, the BLS confidentiality policy is stated in Commissioner's Order 3-93, dated August 18, 1993, entitled, "Confidential Nature of BLS Records."  This document states that, in conformance with existing law and Departmental policies, data collected or maintained by, or under the auspices of, BLS under a pledge of confidentiality shall be treated in a manner that will assure that individually-identifiable data will be used only for statistical purposes and will be accessible only to authorized persons.  Further, pre-release economic series data prepared for release to the public shall not be disclosed or used in an unauthorized manner before their official date and time of release, and shall be accessible only to authorized persons.

<DESC>This is a solicitation for services.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is being issued as a Request For Quotation (RFQ) # BLS-03-27 in accordance with FAR Part 13, NTE $50,000.00  
  
  
Description of Services Needed  
  
Services are needed to investigate clustering techniques and develop tools for improving BLS website usability.  This is a continuation of the work completed under PO B9J21144.  This phase of the project will focus on the creation of a set of indexes for BLS vocabularies that will represent 'official' terminology used in reports, releases, data sets, and research papers.  The proposed period of service is September 1, 2003-August 31, 2004.  
  
Statement of Work  
  
Clustering Techniques and Tools for Improving BLS Website Usability  
  
Scope of Work  
  
This work shall investigate a series of statistical clustering techniques to discover logical categories for organizing the tens of thousands of webpages on the BLS website.  In addition to testing different techniques, a suite of computational tools shall be developed that BLS can use to conduct its own analyses over time as the website continues to evolve.  
  
Objectives of Work  
  
1. To improve how people find information on the BLS website.  
  
2. To develop automatic techniques that BLS can use to improve indexing for the BLS website.  
  
3. To apply these techniques to alternative indexes for the BLS website, both to the existing alternative indexes (A-Z, home page organization, etc.) and new ones.  
  
4. To evaluate the effectiveness of these new indexes with respect to existing BLS search and browse services.  
  
5. To develop a set of computational tools that BLS can apply for future iterations of its data collection.   
  
Tasks  
  
The results of this work should provide support for the following tasks:  
  
	Improve the organization of existing indexing schemes;   
	Identification of areas of usage within the agency of important terms, based on program, type of document, or purpose of document;  
	Identification of collocations and phrases for inclusion in a glossary, thesaurus, index, table of contents, or other vocabulary-based resource;  
	Creation and maintenance of alternative user interfaces;  
	Help individual program areas within BLS to better customize their information dissemination services; and  
	Application to content management and email management services throughout BLS offices.  
  
Deliverables  
  
1. A prototype statistical tool kit that accepts BLS webpage documents (HTML, PDF, ASCII), computes alternative representation parameter settings (e.g., stemming, collocation, stop lists), computes term weights (e.g., term frequency X inverse document frequency), produces term-document matrices, and provides alternative dimensionality reduction (e.g., principal component projections) and clustering algorithms (e.g., k-means).  
  
2. Candidate index terms and candidate glossary entries, drawn from different automatic categorizations computed using the tool kit.   
  
3. Automatic classifications of all BLS webpages into the different categorizations.  
  
4. Suggested user interface designs that present these alternative indexes.  
  
5. Final report and recommendations for BLS website evolution.  
  
  
Inspection and Acceptance  
  
Final inspection and acceptance of all items called for in the project will be made by the COTR associated with the project.  
  
  
Period of Work:  September 1, 2003-August 31, 2004  
  
Confidentiality and Security Requirements  
  
a.	The work specified in this contract shall be done exclusively using non-confidential BLS data.  At no point under this contract shall the contractors employees or agents have access to any confidential information.  
  
b.	For the purposes of this contract, "confidential information" includes:

(2) 	Pre-release economic data.  Statistics and analyses that have not yet been cleared for release (that is, have not yet been officially released to the public), including but not limited to those that have a set date and time of release before which they must not be divulged.  
  
(3) 	Embargoed data.  Pre-release economic series data for the Principal Federal Economic Indicators produced by the BLS.  Currently, the following BLS data series have been designated by the Office of Management and Budget as Principal Federal Economic Indicators:  the Consumer Price Index, Employment Situation, Employment Cost Index, Producer Price Indexes, Productivity and Costs, Real Earnings, and U.S. Import and Export Price Indexes.  
  
c.	If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements contained in these clauses, the Contractor shall be deemed to have failed to perform the provision of this contract within the meaning of the default clauses and the contract shall be subject to termination for default.  

BLS AGENT AGREEMENT  
  
PURPOSE.  The purpose of this Agreement is to inform persons who may have access to confidential Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) records of their responsibility for complying with the Confidential Information Protection and Statistical Efficiency Act and other applicable Federal laws and with the confidentiality policies of the BLS.  
  
BACKGROUND.  The BLS of the Department of Labor is the Government's principal fact-finding agency in the field of labor economics.  The majority of the data collected by the BLS are provided on a voluntary basis by respondents who have agreed to provide the information for the purpose(s) specified by the BLS.

<DESC>This is a solicitation for services.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is being issued as a Request For Quotation (RFQ) # BLS-03-30 in accordance with FAR Part 13, NTE $20,000.00  
  
  
Description of Services Needed  
  
Services are needed to continue analysis of the Consumer Expenditure Interview Survey (CEIS) and to expand on work completed in a FY02 project on modeling the reporting error in the screening sections of the CEIS.  The current work will explore new models for estimating the false negative errors in expenditure reports.  The period of service for this work is August 30, 2003 to August 30, 2004.  
  
Continuation of Markov Latent Class Analysis of the CEIS - 2003  
  
I.	Background  
  
Analyses of the data from the Consumer Expenditure Interview Survey (CEIS) have indicated that expenditure estimates suffer from substantial underreporting.  Explorations have been conducted of the first and second order Markov models with and without mover-stayer restrictions and more recently partially latent mover-stayer (pLMS) models in which persons reporting purchasing an item are assumed to report without error.    
  
In addition, recent investigations have been conducted on the correlates of reporting error including age, sex, income, family type, education, and family size of the consumer unit (CU) as well as a constructed variable which combines length of interview and the use of records.  Analysis has provided hypotheses regarding the nature and causes of underreporting in demographic groups and for certain consumer items.  
  
  
II.	Objectives  
  
The objective of this work shall be to continue these investigations of Markov Latent Class Analysis (MLCA) and underreporting in the CEIS to further enhance the understanding of the error.  The major focus of this work shall be to evaluate the validity of the pLMS model for generating estimates of underreporting in all 20 or so consumer items in the analysis.  
  
  
III.	Scope of Work  
  
This work continues the analysis of the CEIS along the lines investigated in Biemer (2000), Biemer and Tucker (2001), and Tucker, Biemer, and Vermunt (2002), and Tucker, Biemer, and Meekins (2003).  The analyses shall continue to focus on modeling the reporting error in the screening sections of the CEIS and exploring new models for estimating the false negative (underreporting) errors in expenditure reports.    
  
  
IV.	Tasks  
  
1.	Evaluate pLMS model fitting methodology.  
  
2.	Refine the definitions of the covariates used in the models and apply model selection approaches to select the most parsimonious models for each item.  
  
3.	Estimate the magnitude of the underreporting error in expenditures due to false negative reports.  
  
4.	Compare estimates of expenditures with estimates from other sources, for example Personal Consumption Expenditures from the National Income and Products Accounts, to assess the validity of the MLCA methodology for estimating the value of missing expenditures.  
  
IV	Data Sets  
  
The data used in the study shall consist of all interviews collected in three years of the CEIS: 1996, 1997, and 1998, beginning in the first quarter of 1996 and ending and the last quarter of 1998.  These are the same data that are being used in the current phase of the work.  
  
V.	Deliverables  
  
The primary deliverable for this work shall be a paper addressing the feasibility of estimating the bias in total value of expenditures.  This document shall describe the estimation methodology and provide preliminary results addressing the feasibility of the MLCA adjustment method.  This report shall be completed by August 2004.  
  
VI.	Inspection and Acceptance  
  
Final inspection and acceptance of all items called for in the project shall be made by OSMR.  
  
VII.  Period of Service:  August 30, 2003 - August 30, 2004  
  
THE CONTRACTOR SHALL ADHERE TO THE BUREAUS CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY REQUIREMENTS.

The Contractor shall be responsible for the following tasks:

A.	TASK AREA 1 - IN VIVO TESTING

In vivo testing panel:  The Offeror shall establish and maintain a panel of pre-clinical models for 6 to 8 childhood cancers, with each cancer type represented by 6-10 different xenograft lines deemed suitable for in vivo drug testing (henceforth termed the pediatric pre-clinical panel).

Stage 1 testing: The Offeror shall conduct experiments to evaluate the therapeutic potential of ten to fifteen agents (or combinations of agents) annually in the first stage of testing.  Stage 1 testing of an agent shall involve evaluating the test agent's activity at its MTD against the entire pediatric pre-clinical panel.

Stage 2 testing:  For agents for which anti-tumor activity is observed in Stage 1 testing, Stage 2 testing shall include a further evaluation of the anti-tumor activity of the agent against the selected tumor types for which activity was observed in Stage 1.  The testing to be performed in Stage 2 will vary depending upon the agent and the responsive tumor types, but may include developing a full dose response curve for the agent against the tumor types for which activity was identified in Stage 1 testing; studying the pharmacokinetics of the agent to correlate anti-tumor activity with the agent's blood levels; studying the agent in orthotopic mouse models and in models of metastatic disease; and studying the agent in relevant genetically engineered mouse models.

B.	TASK AREA 2 - IN VITRO TESTING

In vitro testing:  The Offeror shall establish and maintain a panel of in vitro models for selected childhood cancers to be used for in vitro testing of agents supplied to the Contractor.  Ten to 15 agents entering Stage 1 testing will likely undergo in vitro testing each year against the in vitro panel, and an additional 4 to 8 other agents (or combinations of agents) will likely require testing each year.

C.	TASK AREA 3 - SPECIALIZED STUDIES

Pharmacokinetic evaluations:  The Offeror shall perform studies to determine systemic exposure and plasma elimination kinetics in appropriate animals using the routes of administration used for drug testing for agents progressing to Stage 2 testing for which there are not sufficient extant data describing the pharmacology of the agent in murine models.
Molecular target assessment:  The Offeror shall perform studies to determine to establish whether molecularly targeted agents have achieved target inhibition/modulation under test conditions for selected tested agents.

The Government anticipates that one (1) cost reimbursement completion type contract will be awarded on an incrementally funded basis for a period of five (5) years.  No collect calls will be accepted.  The RFP will be available on or about August 20, 2003 with a due date for receipt of proposals of October 6, 2003.  The RFP may be accessed through internet address: http://rcb.cancer.gov/rcb-internet/.   It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the above Internet site for the release of this Solicitation and Amendments, if any.  POTENTIAL OFFER'S WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR DOWLOADING THEIR OWN COPY OF THE SOLICITATION AND AMENDMENTS.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This is a Request for Proposals (OAM-2003-N-0003).  This combined synopsis/solicitation is organized in eight parts:  (1) Background and Specific Requirements; (2) Cost Proposals; (3) Format and Instructions for Technical Proposal, (4) Technical Evaluation Criteria; (5) Applicability of Federal Acquisition Regulation Provisions, (6) Technical Questions and Mandatory Line of Sight Testing,  (7) Point of contact and (8) Submission of Offers.

1.  BACKGROUND AND REQUIREMENTS:  The General Accounting Office delivers training through a variety of methods, including in house classroom instruction, computer-based and other self-paced training and external programs.  In order to help meet the growing requirements of professional development for both evaluator and support staff, GAO added another delivery method: interactive, instructional television (ITV).  This method has offered GAO the following benefits: greater availability and convenience of external courses delivered directly to GAO classrooms, with the opportunity for just in time training on desired topics taught by experts in the field, live, direct interaction between an instructor and trainees, located at different sites.  GAO initiated an instruction television effort in September of 1993 via microwave transmissions to its classrooms at its 441 G Street NW, Washington, DC headquarters building.  Since that time we had numerous program offerings with participant groups ranging in number from as small as seven (7) participants to as large as 100 plus participants in numerous classrooms.  The term of the requirement is a base period (date of contract award through September 30, 2004) and four (4) renewable option years.  All equipment and support services are to be in place and ready for operational use by GAO within thirty (30) calendar days after the award of contract.  Programming is to be delivered on an as-needed basis according to schedules published by the contractor or as mutually agreed. Requirements:  A copy of the Statement of Work (SOW) can be requested via e-mail Dannerp@GAO.gov or via fax number (202) 512-3999. 2. COST PROPOSAL:  Offerors are required to request via email: Dannerp@GAO.gov) or fax (202) 512-3999 a copy of the  pricing schedule. Failure to complete  and submit the pricing may exclude your offer from consideration. The Pricing Schedule will identify fixed rates over the five-year contract period.  Offeror must submit an original and four (4) copies as a separate document from the technical proposal. 3.  FORMAT AND INSTRUCTIONS FOR PROPOSALS:  The proposal must be signed by an official authorized to bind the offeror.  Proposals must contain: (a) the name, address and telephone number of the offeror, (b) cost proposal (c) Representations and Certifications at FAR 52.212-3 (d) technical proposal (original and four copies) addressing the technical approach of how GAO's requirements will be satisfied.  Technical proposals should not exceed 25 pages.  Pages beyond 25 will not be considered. Offerors that fail to furnish required representation and certifications or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from further consideration.  4. TECHNICAL EVALUATION CRITERIA:  FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation Commercial Items).  This is a best value procurement.  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the government, price and other factors considered.  For this solicitation, technical quality is more important than cost or price.  As proposals become more equal in their technical merit, the evaluated cost or price becomes more important. Also, the government reserves the right to make an award on the basis of 
initial proposal, without holding discussions.  Therefore, the offeror initial proposal should contain their best terms from a technical and cost standpoint. The following elements are to be included in your technical proposal. The following factors will be used to evaluate offers and should be addressed in your technical proposal:   (a) Technical 
Approach and Management (45 points):  The offeror must submit a description of the Services/products it will provide that demonstrates it clearly understands the Statement of 
Work and all required details of the RFP.  The offerors technical approach should include how its firm plans to meet all components of the GAOs requirement as identified in the Statement of Work.  Technical and Equipment, Administrative and Support; and Programming must be addressed.  Each of these components will be evaluated on the basis of its contribution to the offerors overall ability to deliver satisfactorily training to GAO.  Points will be awarded by assessing the offerors project plan or descriptive literature and supporting documents as follows: Programming (25 points):  Programming includes the range and selection of actual courses offered, as identified in the requirement above); Technical and Equipment (10 points): Technical and equipment includes the transmission of broadcast signals (and any backup system of providing programming) 
plus the provision, I installation, maintenance and removal of equipment, as identified in the requirement above; and Administrative and Support (10 points): Administrative and 
support includes all activities, which contribute to effective delivery and programming as well as procedures, which facilitate efficient administration and management as identified in this requirement. (b) Corporate Experience and Past Performance (including references), (45 Points):  Corporate Experience: The offeror proposal should include a general description of background, experience and qualification that is related to the requirement in this CBD/RFP.  The offeror must also demonstrate that it has provided products/services and programming to other government agencies and/or private entities for which it done business with either as a contractor or subcontractor satisfactorily within the last three (3) years.  Past Performance (references) The offeror must submit the name(s) of the agency/firm, address, phone number and a name of contact for each reference listed as a contractor or subcontractor. If performed as a subcontractor, to what extent the offeror are/were regularly engaged in and have successfully conducted project similar 
in magnitude and its complexity.  GAO reserves the right to contact any of the named agencies and entities.  In evaluating past performance, GAO will consider information obtained from past and present customers.  By past performance, GAO means the 
offerors record of conformity to specifications and to standards of good workmanship, adherence to contract schedules, and cooperation and commitment to customer satisfaction.  ( c) Key Personnel (10 points) : Key Personnel includes the qualifications 
of the key management, administrative and technical staff that would have a significant bearing on the quality of equipment, services and programming delivered to GAO.  This includes,

The YMP is a monitored geologic repository for spent nuclear fuel and high level radioactive waste that will be licensed by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). 

To be deemed pre-qualified to receive an RFP, potential bidders must respond affirmatively to all seven (7) questions in the "Pre-Qualification Criteria" section below.

Summary Scope of Work:

The scope of work for this Subcontract will include furnishing technical expertise, supervision, labor, research and development capability for robotic, remote control, and automation design information for a highly radioactive and high temperature environment.  Final and advanced designs of remotely and autonomously operated vehicles will be done by others.  This work scope entails providing conceptual design options, technical review, and consulting capability to ensure that remotely operated systems meet a rigorous set of requirements pertaining to operations in a hazardous environment.  The Subcontractor will be an academic institution with a deep talent pool of researchers, students (both undergraduate and graduate), professors and others with a wide range of experience for developing new and innovative solutions to very complex robotic problems.

Specialized robotic and remotely operated equipment will be used on the surface and underground at a high-level nuclear waste repository.  Equipment will function near waste packages and high radiation areas containing different forms of commercial spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive wastes.  Robotic underground vehicles will venture into, take measurements, and then return safely from an environment that is hot (plus 360o F) and radioactive (plus 180 rad/hr).

Location of the Work:

Work shall be performed at the Subcontractorfs facilities unless otherwise directed by the Contractor.  All work shall be performed within the United States.

Phone: 255-27-2504253/8 Fax: 255-27-2504255/2504481  :  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide technical assistance to the East African Community (EAC) to develop a plan for the implementation of GPS/GNSS technology in the region.   
At a November 2002 GPS/GNSS Planning Meeting of the Africa Indian Ocean regional civil aviation directors, held in Nairobi, Kenya, the EAC delegates unanimously agreed to implement the use of GPS/GNSS on a regional basis.  In order to support this decision, the meeting sponsors (the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA), the Office of the Secretary of Transportation (OST) at the Department of Transportation, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), and the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority), the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA), and the World Bank have held discussions about the steps needed to assist East African countries to implement ICAO and U.S. FAA approved satellite navigation practices.  It was decided that the proposed USTDA-sponsored technical assistance would be a key step in this initiative. The potential grantee, the EAC Secretariat, would serve as a central coordinator for this project.  

Components of the study include:
1.  Economic Analysis
a.     International industry analysis	
b.     Market demand analysis 
c.     Competitive analysis:  
d.     Equity sponsor analysis
e.     Project company analysis
2.  Financial Analysis
a.     Updated financial model
b.     Sensitivity analysis of the model
c.     Appropriate financial structure and products
d.     Due diligence (risks and mitigants) analysis 
3.  Technical Analysis
4.  Preliminary Environmental Analysis
5.  Development Impact Analysis (for the South African Government)
6.  Identify U.S. Equipment and Services
7.  Implementation Plan
8.  Final Report

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $199,960 grant to the Grantee from USTDA.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firms name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mailroom before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 5:00 PM, local time on September 22, 2003 at the above address. Any proposal received after the deadline will be returned unopened.  Bidders should be warned that documents at times (even where sent by courier), may be delayed or held at Customs border points in East Africa. Therefore, it is in the bidders interest to factor that into their timing and logistics to meet the submittal deadlines.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>POC: Evangela Kunene, Procument Data Manager, Tel: 703-875-4357, Fax: 703-875-4009, E-mail: ekunene@tda.gov:  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE  :  Proposal Submission Place:  Dr. Krishnaswamy Rajivan, CEO, Tamil Nadu Urban Development Fund, Vairam Complex, 112 Theyagaraya Road, 1st Floor,  T. Nagar, Chennai, India - 600 017.,  Phone: (044) 28153103, 28153104, 28153105, Fax: 	(044) 28153106,  Email: admin@tnudf.com or venkataraman@tnudf.com  :  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for assisting the Tamil Nadu Urban Development Fund (TNUDF) improve its capacity to provide sub-sovereign financing for water and sanitation infrastructure projects in the state of Tamil Nadu, India

Although official statistics indicate that 85 percent of urban residents have access to safe water, many Indian cities provide water for only a few hours a day.  Water access for the poor and sanitation services are even less adequate.  The Government of India (GOI) has made a commitment to improve this situation.  The Ninth Five-Year Plan sets a broad objective of achieving 100 percent coverage with water supply in urban areas and 60 percent coverage with sanitation.  The plan calls for significant private funding to be mobilized to meet these targets. 

The use of public-private partnerships, such as Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) schemes, have had limited success in India to date.  Over the past seven years, with assistance from the U.S. Government, the GOI has actively experimented with sub-sovereign finance mechanisms.  Only a handful of projects have been successfully financed to date, but the potential for expansion of this market is great.  One of the states that has played a leadership role to date is Tamil Nadu.  They are now at the point where they are ready to raise a pool of funds to support municipal projects within the state.  

The Tamil Nadu Urban Development Fund (TNUDF) was established in 1996 by the Government of the State of Tamil Nadu to mobilize funding from public and private sources for urban development in the state.  TNUDF is a joint venture between the state and three Indian financial institutions:  ICICI Ltd., the Housing Development Finance Corporation, and Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Limited.  The Grantee is a private fund management company established to manage the TNUDF.

TNUDF is described by the World Bank as the first public-private joint financial intermediary in India specializing in municipal financing without the use of state government guarantees.  TNUDF was the outgrowth of more than 20 years of assistance to Tamil Nadu State by the World Bank, USAID, and other donors, which has helped the state to become a model for decentralization and sound urban management in India.  Specifically, TNUDF was created to build on and strengthen an experiment begun with the creation of the Municipal Urban Development Fund.  With support from the World Bank and its own funds, the Fund had, by 1999, financed more than 500 sub-projects covering roads, bridges, street lights, solid waste plants, storm water drains, bus stations, and markets in 90 out of 110 municipalities in Tamil Nadu.  TNUDF has successfully completed its first bond issuance, which was a refinancing of existing debt (debt swap) for 14 municipalities.  The next bond issuance is expected to finance $20 million of water and sanitation projects in about 9 municipalities.

TNUDF is similar in many ways to U.S. State Revolving Funds.  It therefore constitutes an important experiment in transferring this model to the developing world.  Unlike the BOT model of project finance, the TNUDF model mobilizes private capital from diverse sources but retains the primary responsibility for servicing this debt within the public sector.  Ultimately, TNUDF wishes to operate on the model of a U.S. bond bank.  In the short term, TNUDF requires assistance with managing existing bond issuances and in establishing effective systems for future bond issuances.  The Grantee has requested USTDA technical assistance to advise on the following topics:
	The development of a system to service bonds issued by the fund and to track the issuance and repayment of debt by participating municipalities and local authorities; 
	Potential credit enhancement strategies to increase the creditworthiness and marketability of their issues, making it possible to issue bonds successfully without continued government guarantees; and
	The establishment of more effective systems for assessing and improving the creditworthiness of municipalities and authorities within its scope of operation, including measures to mobilize public support for bond issues and the financial stability of municipal services.

The objectives of this Technical Assistance are to assess current TNUDF procedures, capabilities and systemic deficiencies, as well as identify and develop alternative approaches to remedying these deficiencies to develop financial sustainability and independence.  

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $300,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firms name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 P.M., July XXX, 2003 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>Technical POC/Program Manager, Mr. David E. Krzysiak, AFRL/IFGA, 525 Brooks Rd, Rome, NY, 13441-4505, telephone: (315) 330-7454, email: David.Krzysiak@afrl.af.mil.  Contracting POC: AFRL/IFKA, Renee F. Arcuri, Contracting Officer, 26 Electronic Parkway, NY 13441-4514, telephone: (315) 330-4777, email: Renee.Arcuri@rl.af.mil. AFRL Rome Research Site is soliciting white papers for concept developments, experiments, and demonstrations involving new and innovative approaches to support future Air Force networking, services, and information assurance requirements in the context of a Global Information Grid (GIG). The GIG is a globally interconnected, interoperable, and secure system of systems for collecting, processing, storing, disseminating, and managing information on demand to warfighters, policy makers, and support personnel. Leveraging commercial technologies and the potential for dual use by both the military and civilian communities are two additional aspects of this program. This activity is aimed at addressing the scale and complexity of a GIG which will provide new, end-user, multimedia, information services and support, distributed   command & control, intelligence, telemedicine and similar applications. These services and applications are vital to the Air Force mission to deploy and sustain forces anywhere in the world. To this end, the ability to send a wide variety of data across a global network comprised of communications channels of varying characteristics, in a secure, survivable manner, is of prime importance. An underlying assumption is that DOD communications will be derived from the commercial, national, and international fiber optic cable infrastructure. However, to reach deployed or airborne units, wireless extension of that infrastructure is necessary. Both terrestrial and satellite transmission systems will be required to support this extension capability and will also be inherent components of these deployed networks. In both instances, they will be required to support large amounts of information throughput. Candidate areas of technical research in support of communications networking, services, and information assurance technology for a GIG are: 1) Implementation and novel Extension of High Speed Large Scale Networks:  Effective implementation of networks to support a deployed Joint Forces Air Component Command and below. Efforts should address areas related to security and authentication, survivability and dependability, traffic management and traffic flow control, network management in a virtual network environment, mobile nodes and networks, self reconfiguring, and dynamic routing.  Technologies to support network management will provide global management of the entire information infrastructure. Future management systems must provide for this overall management capability. This infrastructure includes numerous resources such as communications equipment, network switching equipment, distributed operating systems, and user applications. Encouraged are new and innovative ideas in management systems technologies including visualization techniques, network emulation, artificial intelligence, and any other appropriate technology. Also encouraged is technology to provide specific management techniques for heterogeneous network environments, as well as cooperating management entities. Effective extension of network technology developments to provide launch points from high speed networks into highly constrained deployed networks.
2) Interoperability: For interoperability of an increasingly diverse set of transmission systems, work is encouraged but not limited to; development and demonstration of theater (deployed) fiber optic and high bandwidth RF (including satellite links) networking technology for high bandwidth communications between multi-media display systems that provide an interactive, common picture of battlespace to Theater and Component Commanders. The network should be scaleable, modular, survivable, secure, and provide for interoperability with global commercial communications infrastructure. Examples of enhancing the bandwidth capacity are: Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM), ultra short pulse Time Division Multiplexing (TDM), Optical Code Division Multiplexing (OCDMA) and a hybrid of such schemes. Examples of devices are: integrated transmitters and receivers, amplifiers, switches (SONET, ATM, Packet), synchronizers, frequency translators, filters, and routers. 3) User Network Services: The goal is to formulate innovative ideas for user services which use high bandwidth global networks, low bandwidth battlesite networks, airborne segments, and combinations of the these, experiment with them, and possibly develop promising ideas into demonstrable prototypes. Future services will provide the capability for day-to-day mission planning/execution in a distributed C2 coalition environment and assist commanders in making critical decisions in heavy stress situations. Past work in this area has centered around interactive, interpersonal communications services (workstation video windows, video conferencing, shared workplace graphics, multimedia presentation, multimedia conferencing, imagery dissemination) that provide the capability of collaboration among distributed users, both fixed and mobile. Also encouraged are new and innovative ideas for communications services which will support emerging technologies such as visualization and distributed virtual reality, and technologies which support new and innovative communications services such as data compression techniques or others. Also encouraged is work addressing the psychology of individuals and groups in the decision making process in distributed military C2 and the definition of new communications services which support that process. 4) Ultra-wide- bandwidth, multi-channeled, air and space-based communications networks on and between platforms:  Efforts should develop and define optical/electronic network architecture, system and subsystem (transmitter, receiver, switch, optical mux and demux, optical amplifiers, etc.) requirements for multi gigabit per second optical/electronic networks on-board air and space platforms and other AF/DOD applications.  Design and develop passive and active optical/electronic chip scale networking components (transmitters, receivers, switches) for Wave-length Division Multiplexing, RF, Code Division Multiple Access, etc. communications. Implement photonics modules for optical/electronic networking architectures utilizing Integrated Optical Circuits (IOCs) in hybrid and monolithic format.
5) Network Modeling and Simulation: Efforts should research and develop modeling and simulation tools that are trustworthy to predict, with known and characterizable accuracy, network behavior over a broad range of time scales, network sizes and technology composition.  This solicitation also seeks research on appropriate online network measurement methodologies, which in conjunction with modeling and simulation tools will provide the basis for online network analysis and control.   Deliverables should include technical reports, and when appropriate, software and/or advanced technology demonstrations.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. DO NOT SUBMIT A FORMAL PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME. Offerors are required to submit three (3) copies of a three (3) to five (5) page white paper summarizing their proposed approach/solution. The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government. The white paper will be formatted as follows: Section A: Title, Period of Performance, Cost of Task, Name of Company; Section B: Task Objective; and Section C: Technical Summary. Multiple white papers within the purview of this announcement may be submitted by each offeror. Offerors must mark their white papers/proposals with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a). All white papers/proposals shall be double spaced with a font no smaller than 12 pitch. In addition, respondents are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number, a fax number, and an e-mail address with their submission.

DARPA intends to enter into a sole source contract with Photon Research Associates, Inc., San Diego, CA, to perform this effort. The effort is a continuation of research and development currently being performed by Photon Research, and it is likely that award to any other source would result in a substantial duplication of cost that is not expected to be recovered through competition and would also result in unacceptable schedule delays. The research is deemed to be available only from the original source.  This Notice is intended for informational purposes only; it is not a Request for Proposals.

<DESC>ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS.
The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) through its Office of Native American Affairs is implementing a new Native American initiative that will provide small business opportunities and economic development services to this country's most disadvantaged tribal areas.  Accordingly, the SBA seeks qualified small business concerns to propose economic development projects that will empower Native American entrepreneurs located in disadvantaged and under-served Indian reservations and tribal areas.  SBA will make award based on the project(s)' ability to provide increased entrepreneurial development opportunities, and other criteria as set forth in the statement of work.  Selected projects must have the potential to become "best practices" for implementation by other entities around the U.S.  They must also include viable plans for identifying alternate funding options so that successful projects can continue without further SBA funding.  The total amount budgeted for this effort is $682,300.  Selection of projects for award may involve partial and/or multiple awards.  This requirement is a 100% set aside for small business concerns.  NAICS Code 541690, "other scientific and technical (economic) consulting services"  applies, with a size standard of $6 million.
The solicitation document is in final preparation and will be posted in Fedbizopps within 5 business days.  The proposal due date will be specified at that time.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>NA The Garrison Commander, Fort Myer, Virginia announced on 7 August 2003 its tentative decision to retain in-house the Base Operations Support Services functions. This decision is the result of a competitive process conducted in accordance with Office of Man agement and Budget Circular A-76. The final analysis indicated that the Government did not receive any acceptable private-sector offer to compete against the Most Efficient Organization (MEO). There was no cost comparison and the tentative decision in the Base Operations Support Services study is to implement the MEO.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center, Weapons Division, China Lake, CA is issuing this synopsis to modify the original synopsis published 8 Nov 99. N68936-00-D-0027 was issued on a sole source basis on 24 Feb 00. It was issued to Syracuse Research Corporation (SRC) as the sole designer and manufacturer of the initial Passive Surveillance Radar (PSR). The purpose of the proposed contract modification is to extend the Period of Performance (POP) and add work to the contract in support of the upgrade to the PSR Engineering Development Model (EDM). Further development is needed to support joint field experiments planned in FY04 and to ultimately meet fleet requirements in FY06. The contract modification will extend the POP for a period of two years and include a Level of Effort (LOE) of 7,800 hours. This will allow continued design and fabrication of the PSR EDM unit and integration testing of the EDM unit with the NAWCWD control computer and operator interface software. It is in the governments best interest to utilize the designer and manufacturer of the PSR to continue upgrade efforts. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, any firms believing that they can fulfill the requirement may submit a written response to be received at the contracting office no later than 15 days after the date of publication of this notice, clearly showing its ability to do so without causing programmatic hardship. All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency. Respond to Bryan Gregory, by email to bryan.gregory@navy.mil, by fax to 760-939-9651, or by mail to Commander, NAWCWD, code 210000D (B. Gregory), China Lake CA 93555-6100.

<DESC>POC: Evangela Kunene, Procument Data Manager, Tel: 703-875-4357, Fax: 703-875-4009, E-mail: ekunene@tda.gov:  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE  :  Proposal Submission Place:  Dr. Krishnaswamy Rajivan, CEO, Tamil Nadu Urban Development Fund, Vairam Complex, 112 Theyagaraya Road, 1st Floor,  T. Nagar, Chennai, India - 600 017.,  Phone: (044) 28153103, 28153104, 28153105, Fax: 	(044) 28153106,  Email: admin@tnudf.com or venkataraman@tnudf.com  :  The Grantee, Tamil Nadu Urban Infrastructure Financial Services, Ltd., invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide Technical Assistance to assist the Tamil Nadu Urban Development Fund (TNUDF) improve its capacity to provide sub-sovereign financing for water and sanitation infrastructure projects in the state of Tamil Nadu, India

The Tamil Nadu Urban Development Fund (TNUDF) was established in 1996 by the Government of the State of Tamil Nadu to mobilize funding from public and private sources for urban development in the state.  TNUDF is a joint venture between the state and three Indian financial institutions:  ICICI Ltd., the Housing Development Finance Corporation, and Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Limited.  The Grantee is a private fund management company established to manage the TNUDF.

TNUDF is described by the World Bank as the first public-private joint financial intermediary in India specializing in municipal financing without the use of state government guarantees.  TNUDF was the outgrowth of more than 20 years of assistance to Tamil Nadu State by the World Bank, which has helped the state to become a model for decentralization and sound urban management in India.  Specifically, TNUDF was created to build on and strengthen an experiment begun with the creation of the Municipal Urban Development Fund.  With support from the World Bank and its own funds, the Fund had, by 1999, financed more than 500 sub-projects covering roads, bridges, street lights, solid waste plants, storm water drains, bus stations, and markets in 90 out of 110 municipalities in Tamil Nadu.  TNUDF has successfully completed its first bond issuance, which was a refinancing of existing debt (debt swap) for 14 municipalities.  The next bond issuance is expected to finance $20 million of water and sanitation projects in about 9 municipalities.

TNUDF is similar in many ways to U.S. State Revolving Funds.  It therefore constitutes an important experiment in transferring this model to the developing world.  Ultimately, TNUDF wishes to operate on the model of a U.S. bond bank.  In the short term, TNUDF requires assistance with managing existing bond issuances and in establishing effective systems for future bond issuances.  The Grantee has requested the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) Technical Assistance to advise on the following topics:

	The development of a system to service bonds issued by the fund and to track the issuance and repayment of debt by participating municipalities and local authorities; 
	Potential credit enhancement strategies to increase the creditworthiness and marketability of their issues, making it possible to issue bonds successfully without government guarantees; and
	The establishment of more effective systems for assessing and improving the creditworthiness of municipalities and authorities within its scope of operation, including measures to mobilize public support for bond issues and the financial stability of municipal services.
	Develop TNWSPF on the lines of US bond bank/State Revolving Fund

The objectives of this Technical Assistance are to assess current TNUDF procedures and  capabilities and systemic deficiencies, as well as identify and develop alternative approaches to improve and develop remedying these deficiencies to develop financial sustainability and independence.  

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $300,000 grant to the Grantee from the USTDA.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firms name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mailroom before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 P.M., September 26, 2003 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

Service:  Contractor shall process and/or transport Government furnished cylinders, marked both as containing Halon 1301 and empty to be filled with Halon at/from Defense Depot Richmond Virginia (DDRV); weigh cylinders, provide a detailed report of findings, inspect and refurbish Government furnished 1,000 empty cylinders.  Material to be processed is contained in 910 filled system and storage containers, approximately 100,000 pounds.  Contractor shall then reclaim material to remove physical impurities, package reclaimed Halon 1301 in Government furnished cylinders and have material certified by an independent laboratory that packaged Halon 1301 meets all requirements of ASTM D 5632 Type II specification.

<RESPDATE>090603
<CONTACT>Dave Keehan, 202-264-3056
<DESC>This is the third announcement regarding the Federal Aviation Adminis= tration Data Display System (FAADDS).  The first announcement was a Market = Survey for the Information Display and Control System.  The second announce= ment renamed the procurement the Federal Aviation Administration Data Displ= ay System (FAADDS), with no changes in functionality, and alerted Industry = that a draft Requirements Document and Statement of Work would soon be post= ed to the FAA Contract Opportunities Website.  This third announcement prov= ides Industry with the Preliminary Requirements Document and Preliminary St= atement of Work for the Federal Aviation Administration Data Display System=  (FAADDS).  The FAA is releasing these preliminary documents to obtain Indu= stry comment and recommendation.  The FAA is especially interested in cost = saving recommendations based on Industry experience with previously develop= ed systems that are operational. As described in previous FAA Contract Opportunity Website announcements (Se= ptember 2002 and March 2003), FAADDS is proposed as the FAA=E2=80=99s next = generation data display system.  FAADDS will provide rapid retrieval and di= splay of a wide range of weather, operational support, and administrative d= ata to air traffic controllers in Air Traffic Control Towers (ATCTs) and Te= rminal Radar Approach Controls (TRACONS), as well as in other FAA and non-F= AA facilities. =20 Information will be displayed in formats and with contents designed for rap= id operator understanding and assimilation with minimum human interaction. =  The system will interface with a large number of FAA systems to receive in= formation for display.  Information displayed will be identical in content = and format to the source. The system will be comprised of workstations networked together in local ar= ea networks (LANs) and wide area networks (WANs) to provide shared informat= ion management and display.  The system will be scalable in order to meet t= he information display needs of a full spectrum of facilities from very lar= ge to small terminal areas. The system will be comprised of commercial off-= the shelf (COTS) and non-developmental item (NDI) hardware and software to = facilitate configuration control, maintenance, training, and system upgrade=  by Government personnel.  The Government intends to procure data rights ne= cessary for itself or third parties to maintain and enhance the software. It is estimated that approximately 3000 workstations for 500 sites will be = procured.  Delivery is estimated at 600 workstations per year over a five-y= ear period starting in FY05/FY06. Industry comment/recommendation will be accepted until 30 calendar days aft= er this posting.  Specific comments should identify the document, page numb= er, and section number.  The Government reserves the right, to meet in pers= on with any, all, or none of the respondents, in order to clarify comment/r= ecommendation.  If this is necessary, all meetings will be completed within=  90 days after the posting date of this announcement.  The Government will = not respond either in writing or verbally, to any comment/recommendation ot= her than as described above.  The final Requirements Document and Statement=  of Work will provide evidence of Government consideration of comments/reco= mmendations received. It is the Government=E2=80=99s intention to release within a year, via the = FAA Contract Opportunities Website, either a draft Solicitation Information=  Request (SIR) for Industry comment or a formal SIR for Industry response. Please forward all comments/recommendations via email, to the Contracting O= fficer, Mr. David A. Keehan.

<DESC>NA The Army FCMP (Forms Content Management Program) is asking industry to provide information to support a solution that will become the platform upon which to revolutionize the current forms management to content management and to create a development plan f or a common enterprise-wide infrastructure. The selected infrastructure must adhere to government and industry standards to ensure all developed solutions are interoperable. The Infrastructure must provide all Army personnel with the ability to seamlessly access all applicable processes currently managed by forms through an online portal, with or without internet access to manage the lifecycle of information.  Also,  create an d assist existing program offices with modernization of local solutions per unique requirement using standard hardware and software infrastructure to automate these manual forms-based processes while reducing redundant technical solutions. Vendors are encouraged to submit, along with their descriptive literature concerning their products, current government pricing for said products. The Army is sensitive on total cost of ownership of the host service; availability; speed and degree of distr ibution of services and support for the solution; security features of the solution; global scalability; vendor direction and long-term viability. While the Army requires a solution with the smallest desktop footprint possible, the information provided sho uld support an Army enterprise that is global in scope and addressing the needs of all personnel supporting the Army mission.        This RFI will be used to gather information about the commercially available solutions able to satisfy the mission objectives of the FCMP. This RFI is designed to identify vendors who have successfully implemented their products in a solution similar to the FCMP in size and scope. The information  sought hereunder is for informational purposes only and is not a request for proposals.       The Army does not intend to award a contract as a result of RFI responses.  Responses are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. This RFI requests corporate marketing information about commercial off-the-shelf p roducts and demonstrated corporate capability.  The Army intends to analyze the information it receives to plan and implement its FCMP mission objectives.         Information reguarding submission is contained in the Draft requirement at the DCC-W web page.       For a more detailed information referencing the Governments needs go to the Defense Contract Command -Washington Web page @ http://dccw.hqda.pentagon.mil for downloading.

<DESC>The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center (FISC) Norfolk Detachment Washington, 1014 N street SE, Suite 400, Washington Navy Yard, DC 20374-5014 is soliciting REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION (RFI) from potential industry sources to provide mediation services and mediation training services for the Department of the Navy (DON) ADR Program and the Legal Assistance Program. **This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a request for proposal (RFP) or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any services.  Additionally the Government may utilize any information submitted by interested parties to assist in developing a statement of work and/or statement of objectives that could potentially result in a competitive solicitation.  We advise offerors not to submit any information that they would not want to be used for this purpose.  BACKGROUND:  The Department of the Navy (DON ADR Program and the Legal Assistance Program will sponsor a pilot program testing a specific model of facilitative mediation in the context of legal assistance services for eligible clients, e.g., Sailors, Marines, retirees and dependents.  This pilot involves local mediation training programs that offers co-mediation training to students from the general public and is the primary subject of this request.  All mediators provided by the contractor under this contract must be certified and have mentor status pursuant to Guidelines adopted by the Judicial Council of Virginia or an equivalent certification.  DON locations for services and training will be the Maryland, Washington, DC and Virginia areas.  DON reserves the right to designate services and training locations not included in the Washington Metro area.  Should this pilot go formal, it is anticipated that it will be for a one-year period, with possible option years.  If a lawyer in one legal assistance office recommends mediation to his client, one of the other offices involved in the pilot will convene the mediation, including scheduling and providing a meeting room.  Legal assistance offices operate under the general authority found in 10 USC 1044, which makes services available subject to the availability of legal staff resources.  One of the purposes of this pilot program is to find the most cost-effective method of providing high quality mediation service for eligible clients, while recognizing the statutory resource limitation.  To maximize cost-effectiveness, mediations conducted under this pilot program will not include the participation of attorneys as advocates or representatives of the clients.  While parties are free to retain, consult and rely upon counsel, such counsel will not be present at joint or caucus mediation sessions.  Clients are free, as the need might arise, to take breaks for telephonic consultation with their attorneys.

<DESC>Sandia is a multi-program laboratory operated by Sandia Corporation, a Lockheed Martin company, for the United States Department of Energy (DOE).  Test Capabilities Revitalization (TCR) is a proposed federal line item construction project intended to modernize a number of experimentation and test capabilities in Sandias Engineering Sciences Center.  The overall goal of the project is to modernize infrastructure and diagnostic capability to support the Stockpile Stewardship Plan and in particular the Stockpile Life Extension Program (SLEP), the Accelerated Strategic Computing Initiative (ASCI), and the Weapons Systems Engineering Certification Campaign (C6) Program.  This project will provide Sandia with the capability to (1) qualify the active nuclear weapons stockpile in accordance with SLEP; (2) investigate and develop weapon components, sub systems, and systems; and (3) develop and validate modeling and simulation codes.  A subproject of the TCR Line Item is the Thermal Test Complex (TTC).

The suggested web site to learn more about Sandia is http://www.sandia.gov/

Sandia National Laboratories (Sandia), in Albuquerque, New Mexico is issuing this Request for Statement of Qualifications  (SOQ) for the construction of the Thermal Test Complex facility, (TTC).  This facility includes a new FLAME/Radiant Heat test cell, an indoor Crossflow Fire Test Facility (XTF), a Thermal Test Facility (TTF) to house the Radiant Heat lab along with other labs (e.g. environmental chambers, diagnostic development, abnormal thermal environments lab, etc.), and various support structures (e.g. covered storage, central utility building, etc.).

The Contractor shall have full responsibility for this project, including construction, installation of equipment, hardware systems integration, documentation and commissioning.  

Construction Estimate:  $15,000,000 to $20,000,000. 

Following is a high-level look at the required technical capabilities to perform this SOW.

REQUIRED TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES:

Proposing firms shall demonstrate relevant knowledge and construction experience similar to the following types of industrial and commercial facilities (Note:  all quantity estimates are approximate):	

	FLAME/Radiant Heat Test Cell

This consolidation of the existing Radiant Heat and FLAME test capabilities will provide the ability to simulate combined convective-radiative thermal environments.  The existing Radiant Heat Facility in TA-III provides controlled temperature and heat flux environments using quartz lamps (up to 3,000C).  This dial-a-fire capability will be integrated into the new FLAME/Radiant Heat Test Cell within the TTC.  The structure will be a cylindrical water-jacketed test cell.   The facility will be used to investigate the properties of fire environments in an enclosed, air flow- and temperature-controlled structure.  

	Test Facility Size (approx.)	50 ft high x 60 ft diameter 
	Area ( 5%)	3,100 gsf
	Maximum Fuel Fire	20.0 MW
	Maximum Radiant Test, (Electrical Power)	5.2 MW
	Airflow	0150,000 scfm inlet

	Thermal Test Facility (TTF)

The TTF will be a multiuse facility that will house various diagnostic labs and test areas, a machine shop, assembly area, offices, and meeting rooms.  These components will include a 1,600 sf (&#61617;5%) Radiant Heat Test Cell, a 2,500 sf (&#61617;5%) Abnormal Thermal Environments Laboratory and approximately 9,800 sf (&#61617;5%) allotted for a Central Control Room, secure storage, light laboratories, environmental chambers, and office space (six to eight offices).  The TTF will also include the separate Central Utilities Building (CUB) and 2,000 sf of external covered storage.  

	Thermal Test Facility Size: (approx.)	130 ft x 104 ft 
	Area (5%)	13,900 gsf
	Maximum Radiant Test, (Electrical Power)	5.2 MW
		
	Crossflow Test Fire Facility (XTF)

The XTF will provide a unique indoor test environment capable of convective heat testing environments with controllable air cross flow.  The XTF is designed to safely test the effects of thermal flux on test articles that could contain explosives and/or hazardous materials.  The XTF is isolated from other structures within the TTC and blast walls have been incorporated into design in case a test article was to inadvertently fail.  The interior walls have also been specially designed for heat rejection and ease of decontamination.   

	Test Facility Size (approx.)	25 ft x 25 ft x 60 ft 
	Area (5%)	4,715 gsf
	Maximum Fuel Fire	20.0 MW
	Maximum Radiant Test, (Electrical Power)	2.0 MW
	Airflow	8,500170,000 scfm inlet

	General Site Utilities

	Appx. 35,000 cy of backfill will be required to raise the entire complex above the floodplain.
	Appx. 300 lf of 10 X 12 High Temperature Ductwork, (some portions installed 70 above grade) is required between the facilities.
	Primary Exhaust Fan will be 700 HP with an 80 freestanding 10 diameter exhaust stack.
	The complex will include a total of appx. 10MW of connected Electrical Load.

SOQ Process:

At this time, we are only requesting SOQs to establish a short-list of qualified General Contractors.  For the purpose of this initial SOQ, Sandia National Laboratories is only interested in responses from General Contractors that can perform all of the above stated technical requirements, have the capability to bond a project of this size and can provide all necessary construction resources.  Selection of the short listed construction firms will be based on the SOQs that represent the best overall value to the government based on the specific criteria indicated below.   Short listed Firms will be sent a Request for Quotation (RFQ) with drawings, specifications, etc, (electronically on compact disk - CD) in October 2003.  Bid packages will be due back to Sandia approximately five weeks later.  Again, selection of the successful construction firm will be based on the RFQ that represents the best value to the government based on the updated detailed criteria indicated within the RFQ.  Note that the RFQ will likely request the extent of the contractors intent to use New Mexico and small subcontractors for this SOW.  Contract award is anticipated to be early January 2004.  Construction duration is anticipated to be 14 months.

<SUBJECT>Y -- RFP for Construction of Thermal Test Complex Facility
<DESC>Description:
Sandia is a multi-program laboratory operated by Sandia Corporation, a Lockheed Martin company, for the United States Department of Energy (DOE).  Test Capabilities Revitalization (TCR) is a proposed federal line item construction project intended to modernize a number of experimentation and test capabilities in Sandias Engineering Sciences Center.  The overall goal of the project is to modernize infrastructure and diagnostic capability to support the Stockpile Stewardship Plan and in particular the Stockpile Life Extension Program (SLEP), the Accelerated Strategic Computing Initiative (ASCI), and the Weapons Systems Engineering Certification Campaign (C6) Program.  This project will provide Sandia with the capability to (1) qualify the active nuclear weapons stockpile in accordance with SLEP; (2) investigate and develop weapon components, sub systems, and systems; and (3) develop and validate modeling and simulation codes.  A subproject of the TCR Line Item is the Thermal Test Complex (TTC).

The suggested web site to learn more about Sandia is http://www.sandia.gov/

Sandia National Laboratories (Sandia), in Albuquerque, New Mexico is issuing this Request for Proposals Statement of Qualifications (RFP) (SOQ) for the construction of the Thermal Test Complex facility, (TTC).  This facility includes a new FLAME/Radiant Heat test cell, an indoor Crossflow Fire Test Facility (XTF), a Thermal Test Facility (TTF) to house the Radiant Heat lab along with other labs (e.g. environmental chambers, diagnostic development, abnormal thermal environments lab, etc.), and various support structures (e.g. covered storage, central utility building, etc.).

The Contractor shall have full responsibility for this project, including construction, installation of equipment, hardware systems integration, documentation and commissioning.  

Construction Estimate:  $15,000,000 to $20,000,000. 

Following is a high-level look at the required technical capabilities to perform this SOW.

REQUIRED TECHNICAL CAPABILITIES:

Proposing firms shall demonstrate relevant knowledge and construction experience similar to the following types of industrial and commercial facilities: 	

	FLAME/Radiant Heat Test Cell

This consolidation of the existing Radiant Heat and FLAME test capabilities will provide the ability to simulate combined convective-radiative thermal environments.  The existing Radiant Heat Facility in TA-III provides controlled temperature and heat flux environments using quartz lamps (up to 3,000C).  This dial-a-fire capability will be integrated into the new FLAME/Radiant Heat Test Cell within the TTC.  The structure will be a cylindrical water-jacketed test cell.   The facility will be used to investigate the properties of fire environments in an enclosed, air flow- and temperature-controlled structure.  

	Test Facility Size (approx.)	50 ft high x 60 ft diameter 
	Area ( 5%)	3,100 gsf
	Maximum Fuel Fire	20.0 MW
	Maximum Radiant Test, (Electrical Power)	5.2 MW
	Airflow	0150,000 scfm inlet

	Thermal Test Facility (TTF)

The TTF will be a multiuse facility that will house various diagnostic labs and test areas, a machine shop, assembly area, offices, and meeting rooms.  These components will include a 1,600 sf (&#61617;5%) Radiant Heat Test Cell, a 2,500 sf (&#61617;5%) Abnormal Thermal Environments Laboratory and approximately 9,800 sf (&#61617;5%) allotted for a Central Control Room, secure storage, light laboratories, environmental chambers, and office space (six to eight offices).  The TTF will also include the separate Central Utilities Building (CUB) and 2,000 sf of external covered storage.  

	Thermal Test Facility Size: (approx.)	130 ft x 104 ft 
	Area (5%)	13,900 gsf
	Maximum Radiant Test, (Electrical Power)	5.2 MW
		
	Crossflow Test Fire Facility (XTF)

The XTF will provide a unique indoor test environment capable of convective heat testing environments with controllable air cross flow.  The XTF is designed to safely test the effects of thermal flux on test articles that could contain explosives and/or hazardous materials.  The XTF is isolated from other structures within the TTC and blast walls have been incorporated into design in case a test article was to inadvertently fail.  The interior walls have also been specially designed for heat rejection and ease of decontamination.   

	Test Facility Size (approx.)	25 ft x 25 ft x 60 ft 
	Area (5%)	4,715 gsf
	Maximum Fuel Fire	20.0 MW

<SUBJECT>99 -- Assistance in statistical methodologies and generally accepted statistical practices
<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services intends to negotiate with Dr. Alan H. Kvanli, 3837 Hunters Trail, Carrollton, TX 75007, on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302.1.  The purpose of this contract would be to obtain expertise to assist the DHHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG)/Office of Audit Services (OAS) in the area of statistical methodologies and generally accepted statistical principles for use in statistical analysis in accordance with the OIG guidelines set forth in OAS Audit Policies and Procedures - Chapter 20-02.   OIG seeks to expand and refine their statistical capability as continually increasing demands on audit resources create a need to develop more efficient and effective sampling plans.   Dr. Kvanli has written computer programs to select sample items using the RHC (Rao, Hartley and Cochran) methodology to appraise audit data.  This methodology is used in multistage audits and has led to a significant reduction in audit resources required.  As the author of these methodologies, he is uniquely qualified to address legal challenges to statistical sampling and estimates.  He is also the developer of the OAS Windows RAT-STATS 2003 statistical software used by OIG/OAS.  Dr. Kvanli alone has both experience, pre-established computer programs and methodologies necessary to appraise, analyze and defend the data collected.  Any other contractor would have to: 1) develop specialized knowledge of the required methodologies,  2) develop similar computer programs, and, 3) acquire knowledge of the on-going audit legal challenges Dr. Kvanli is currently defending for OIG and the knowledge to defend future legal challenges.  Therefore, the government believes that to award this contract to any contractor but Dr. Kvanli would result in a significant increase in cost and even then would not assure adequate service.  The purpose of this synopsis is to determine whether there may be other sources with the requisite qualifications to perform the work described above.  Any organization capable of performing the work should submit a statement of capabilities with documentation supporting its ability to meet the Government=s requirement as described above including a specific statement addressing the fourth factor listed above (source of additional funding).  No solicitation document is available.  Capability statements should be submitted within 45 days of the publication of this synopsis to the contact point and address given above.  See Note 22.

<SUBJECT>F -- Engine/Tender Crew Training Record Inspection
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION  Purpose:  The U. S. Forest Service Regional Office, Portland, Oregon, annually solicits the services of wildland firefighting engines and water tenders for use in suppressing wildland fires on an as-needed basis.  These services are acquired through the Pacific Northwest Interagency Engine and Tender Agreement.  These engines and tenders are required to be staffed with individuals who meet established training, experience, and fitness requirements.  The purpose of this inquiry is to determine the interest in providing services through formal contracting procedures to ensure that these engine and water tender personnel meet the established requirements as described in this Request for Information (RFI).  These services include:  1) Work capacity fitness test monitoring; 2) Certification of contractor employees incident qualifications based on review of training and experience records; (3) Issuing individual employee Incident Identification/Qualification Cards; (4) Maintenance of contractor employee incident qualifications in an electronic database.  We anticipate that these services will be solicited through three contracts, one for western Oregon, one for eastern Oregon, and one for the state of Washington.  The Washington area contract will require that these services be performed for approximately 800 personnel.  The Western Oregon contract area will include all contractors located west of the Cascade Mountains from the Columbia River to the California border, and will require that these services be performed for approximately 700 personnel.  The eastern Oregon area contract will include all contractors located east of the Cascades from the Columbia River to the California border, and will require that these services be performed for approximately 2,000 personnel.  Services To Be Performed:  1)  Work Capacity Fitness Test MonitoringAnnually all engine and water tender personnel are required to pass the Work Capacity Fitness Test at the appropriate level for their position.  Information on the Work Capacity Fitness Test is contained in Fitness and Work Capacity, Second Edition, NFES 1596, April 1997, available from the National Interagency Fire Center, 3833 S. Development Avenue, Boise, ID 83705.  Engine and water tender contractors are required to provide five working days notification prior to administering each test, providing the date, time, address, estimated number of people taking the test, and name and phone number of the person administering the test.  Each work capacity fitness test will be monitored to ensure that it is administered properly to each employee.  Monitoring will include verification of pack weights (where appropriate), documentation of distance and time completed for each employee, and roster of all personnel who took the test (both pass and fail).  2)  Certification of Incident QualificationsThe Pacific Northwest Interagency Engine and Tender Agreement requires that each engine and tender contractor employee be certified as qualified to perform in the position assigned in accordance with Appendix A of the Pacific Northwest Interagency Engine and Tender Agreement (see website below for copy of Appendix A).  Each engine and tender contractor is required to maintain a complete set of employee training, experience, and fitness records for each employee, including position task books that validate the employee meets all requirements for each position the employee is certified to perform in.  These records will be made available for review, and each employees records will undergo intensive review based on standards in PMS 310-1 and supplemental PMS 310-1 established in the Pacific Northwest Interagency Engine and Tender Agreement.  Based on the review of each employees training, experience, and fitness record, each employee will be certified for the position in which they are qualified in accordance with Appendix A of the Pacific Northwest Interagency Engine and Tender Agreement.  3)  Issuing Contractor Employee Incident Identification/Qualification CardEvery person performing work under the Interagency Engine and Tender Agreement must carry an Incident Identification/Qualification Card issued for the effective calendar year of the agreement.  The card must be laminated so that it is tamper proof.  Information on the card must be typewritten and include:  a)  Unique employee number (not a social security number).  b)  Full legal name.  c)  Recent digitized photograph, similar to the size and clarity of a state drivers license.  d)  Date and level of the work capacity fitness test.  e)  Specific incident qualifications.  f)  Seasons of experience.  g)  Card must be color coded to reflect seasons of experience or supervisory level.  4)  Electronic Training Data Base MaintenanceAll firefighter contractor employees incident qualification will be maintained in an electronic database and provided to the Forest Service.

<SUBJECT>F -- Inspection Services for Wildland Firefighting Equipment
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION  Purpose:  The purpose of this inquiry is to determine the interest in providing vehicle inspection services necessary for the U. S. Forest Service to acquire wildland firefighting engines and water tenders as described in this Request for Information (RFI) through formal contracting procedures.  We anticipate that engine and water tender inspection sites will be located in two locations in Oregon (one eastside and one westside), and one location in Washington.  Locations will be determined at a later date.  The one Washington inspection site will service the entire state of Washington and will require inspections for approximately 100 wildland engines and 60 water tenders.  One inspection site in western Oregon will service all wildland engines and water tenders in western Oregon from a line along the crest of the Cascade Mountains from the Columbia River to the California border, and will require inspections for approximately 70 wildland engines and 80 water tenders.  The eastern Oregon inspections site will service all wildland engines and water tenders in all of eastern Oregon from the crest of the Cascades and will require inspections for approximately 250 wildland engines and 165 water tenders.  Total of all inspection may reach 900 pieces of equipment.  Services To Be Performed:  The U. S. Forest Service Regional Office, Portland, Oregon, annually solicits the services of wildland firefighting engines and water tenders for use in suppressing wildland fires on an as-needed basis.  These services are acquired through the Pacific Northwest Interagency Engine and Tender Agreement.  Prior to awarding an agreement to the contractor, each wildland engine and water tender must pass an initial inspection to ensure that the vehicle and equipment meet all requirements of the Interagency Engine and Tender Agreement.  Each vehicle inspection involves checking the vehicle to ensure it is mechanically sound; is within the manufacturers gross vehicle weight limitations when fully loaded; has the required compliment of tools, accessories, and personal protective equipment; and the pump and tank meet all requirements of the agreement.  The period for conducting these inspections will generally be from April 1 through May 15.  Detailed information on the inspection requirements and forms for completing these inspections can be found on the U. S. Forest Service website at www.fs.fed.us/r6/ppm/fire_procurement.htm, Interagency Engine and Tender Agreements, 2003 Interagency Engine and Tender Solicitation RFQ R6-03-004, Appendix J.  Electronic Training Data Base MaintenanceAll firefighter contractor employees incident qualification will be maintained in an electronic database and provided to the Forest Service.  The electronic database format will be Microsoft XLS or Microsoft ACCESS program compatible.  Information Requested:  Companies interested in providing wildland engine and water tender inspection services in one or more of the three inspection sites are requested to provide the following information:  a) Company Name, Mailing Address, Phone Number, and Email Address, b) Describe the nature of your company business; qualifications; capability, including facilities, to provide the inspection services and any experience, c) Identify whether you are interested in these services for Washington, Western Oregon, or Eastern Oregon (interest may be expressed for any or all areas).  Companies that furnish engines and tenders for wildland firefighting, or that have conflicts of interest with companies that provide engines and tenders for wildland firefighting will not be considered for providing these inspection services as outlined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation, Part 3.

<SUBJECT>18 -- Request for Information - Space Lego Project
<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory, Space Vehicles Directorate is soliciting information and follow-up discussions to support research and development of concepts for rapid-prototyping of space systems based on a kind of space "LEGO_TM".   These "LEGOS", also referred to as "protosats", would be a (hopefully small) family of building blocks, from which any complex structure could be built, in this case the skeletal structures of spacecraft.  The protosats could, for example, be panels that contain automatic mechanisms for engaging connections when two panels are placed together.  The panels could contain wiring resources, computing blocks, etc. that when put together form a superset.  The superset can be customized under software control (like FPGAs).  A collection of protosats combined to form an assembly are also referred to as "macrosats".

In addition to "LEGO" or protosat primitives, we envision the possibility of attaching third party devices (e.g. payload elements) in a modular fashion to the skeleton.  The devices could be payload elements, motors (such as reaction wheels, solar panel articulators, etc.) that fit into recesses (perhaps) on the lego panels and engage into the wiring systems.

We further seek to develop the feasibility of a concept referred to as "encapsulation".  With encapsulation, we seek to build systems in a way that is both decentralized and self-organized.  AFRL sponsored projects before in which this idea was demonstrated on the tabletop.  In this example, five or more modules, each with processors, are connected together, forming a collective.   When one module is removed, the "collective" senses the removal and adjusts accordingly.  Temporary masters are "appointed", and if killed, new ones are assigned.  The closest things like this in the industry are smart sensor standards (like IEEE 1451.x, LonWorks, HART), which embody some of the  "plug and play" principles we seek.

Our motivation is to build systems in the most rapid time possible.  It takes 5 years minimum and sometimes more than 15 to build a major space system, from thought to orbit. We believe that under the right "framework", even the most complex systems could be assembled and fielded in phenomenally short timeframes, perhaps days.  Most of the barriers to this goal are: 

(1) wiring harnesses, 
(2) software, 
(3) human fallibility, and
(4) closed, proprietary "standards".  

By using configurable wiring harnesses, it could be possible to eliminate the need to fabricate them as custom assemblies.  We would instead connect "LEGOs" with built-in reconfigurable wiring harnesses (a whole separate discussion), and configure them on the spot.  It is our hope that somehow "encapsulation" might eventually eliminate the need for centralized custom flight software.  Finally, self-organizing interfaces could negotiate the various elements of a system as it is being assembled, while serving as an open systems scheme to overcome closed approaches.

AFRL is considering funding research in this specific technology area and is attempting to gauge industry / academic interest and capability.  Responses should be sent to:  Air Force Research Laboratory/VSSE, Attn: Space Lego Project, 3550 Aberdeen Ave SE, Kirtland AFB, NM 87117-5776.  Written and e-mailed responses are acceptable.  E-mail information to microsys@kirtland.af.mil. The information can be in the form of white papers, presentations, or proposals.  This industry survey does not obligate the government in any manner for any future acquisitions.  This is not a notice of intent to contract.  The government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request for information or otherwise pay for information solicited.  Qualified participants are invited to submit their interests and capability in writing.  Only detailed written or e-mail responses, received within in thirty (30) days after the publication of this announcement will be reviewed.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to pursue future research effort based on responses to this notice.

(v) & (vi) American University  Washington Internships for Native Students Program (WINS) General Requirement:  The Department of Defense is committed to increasing representation of persons of Native American backgrounds within the overall DoD work force.  A key method of accomplishing this requirement is to better inform students at colleges and universities of employment possibilities with DoD upon graduation through temporary internships of such students in DoD facilities during the summer months, as well as during the fall and spring semesters.  How Requirement Developed:  WINS is a visionary effort founded on the idea that young people of the sovereign Native American nations can build leadership skills while, living, studying, and interning in Washington, DC, and bring those skills back to their communities.  The WINS program is administered by the Washington Semester and World Capitals Programs of American University.  We believe this is an exciting opportunity for us to target a hard-to-reach minority population  Overall Program Objectives:  The primary goal is to increase the visibility of DoD within the Native American communities in order to enhance employment opportunities for a wide range of persons.  The expectation is that the interns who work within DoD offices will either themselves apply for permanent positions with DoD upon graduation, or at the very least, communicate a favorable impression of DoD as an employer to fellow students, family members, and friends.  Specific Objectives:  Participating interns are provided employment placement to the maximum extent possible into offices closely matching their areas of interest and expertise.  This will serve the two-fold purpose of ensuring that they are able to use their skills in meaningful employment opportunities, and that the offices to which they are assigned achieve maximum benefit of their skills and knowledge in specific functional areas of science, management, financial operations, technology, program planning, or other fields of study.  Supplier Requirements:  WINS will provide the following services:  recruitment of participants; employment (receiving and processing applications, matching assignments); orientation in Washington, DC prior to entry on duty; developmental activities; support services such as program handbooks and updates, communication; housing assistance; travel expenses to DC area and program evaluation.  Direction on specific methodologies to be used:  Merit principles and careful matching of candidate to employment opportunities.  Applicability of Specification and Standards:  Interns will be fully qualified in specific skills set forth by offices in which employed, and will meet any security requirements.  Period of Performance:  The period of performance for this period is for one fiscal year beginning October 1, 2003 through May 1, 2004.  Government-furnished elements:  OSD and other participating components serviced by WHS will provide office space and requisite office equipment for use by interns during their service.  Government Review and Approval:  A staff member of WHS, Personnel & Security will serve as the internal program manager to provide assistance to management officials and to interns, as required.  Also, will assess the effectiveness of the program at its completion to determine if it should continue in future years.  Reporting Requirements:  WHS, P&S will be continuously monitoring the process to ensure optimum placement opportunities, and overall quality and performance of interns once on board.  Will work closely with WINS to resolve any operational problems, which may arise, plus to assess the program at the end of the summer.  Control Procedures:  The WHS, P&S specialist will work closely with WINS Program Manager to ensure the highest quality interns, and with OSD managers to ensure that realistic work opportunities are identified to match skills and requirements.  A continuous monitoring will be conducted to quickly and efficiently resolve any program problems.  Inspection and acceptance requirements:

The selection process will result in a group of highly qualified interns to be placed in participating offices.  Interns are subject to review in terms of qualifications and security requirements, and will be in-processed to the extent necessary upon their reporting dates.

(vii) Date(s) and place(s) of delivery and acceptance and FOB point: See Item number (v & vi) for dates/performance period.

<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Munitions Directorate, Ordnance Division, Energetic Materials Branch (MNME) seeks commercial quotations for a highly-specialized pulsed-laser spectroscopic diagnostic system.  The following paragraphs explain the minimum technical specifications/requirements for the tunable excitation laser component of this system, consisting of a Nd:YAG pump laser and a wavelength-tunable Optical Parametric Oscillator (OPO).  

Basic Configuration:  In this paragraph, system components to be provided by the vendor are discussed. Those to be provided by AFRL/MNME are identified as government furnished equipment (GFE).  The GFE will not be made available to the vendor for testing.  The output of a Nd:YAG pump laser will be used to drive a wavelength-tunable Optical Parametric Oscillator (OPO) with both items residing on an optical table (GFE).  Vendor will provide any internal or external beam steering optics required to redirect the Nd:YAG output for a secondary function (relay imaging focusing onto a target; these relay imaging optics and the target are GFE) without mechanical displacement of either the Nd:YAG pump laser or the OPO.  Sufficient internal or external beam dumps will be provided for safe operation of the system.  Vendor will supply any interface computer card required for communication between the laser systems electronic control unit and an IBM-compatible personal computer (GFE).  This computer will run a Windows 2000 compatible software package to control the function of, and collect output wavelength and other performance data from the laser system.  The system will include all power supplies, power cables, and control cables required for operation with any combination of the following electrical services:  208 VAC three phase, 30 amp, 60 Hz; 240 VAC single phase, 40 amp, 60 Hz; 110 VAC single phase, 20 amp, 60 Hz operation.  

Mechanical Dimensions:  Vendor will include a mechanical sketch of the entire system with correct external dimensions and relative component placements in their quotation.  The Nd:YAG laser, OPO, and beam steering optics must fit onto a 4 foot x 10 foot section of the optical table.  Free space within this 4x10 foot section will be reserved for the GFE relay imaging optical system, which is proposed to occupy a 6 inch wide by 12 inch tall corridor extending straight out along the Nd:YAG fundamental output port; functionally equivalent alternative placements of these relay imaging optics proposed by the Vendor will also be considered.  Due to extreme lab space limitations smaller power supplies (shorter than 30 inches) capable of fitting underneath the optical table are desirable.  

Anticipated Environmental Variations:  The laser system will be required to operate in a laboratory environment with poor temperature and humidity control.  Typical temperature variations during working hours can cover a 6 degree Celcius (C) range, with occasional variations over a 10 C range also possible.  Vendor will clearly state the temperature ranges over which the following System Performance and Warranty requirements will be met.  Vendor is invited to describe any special design or manufacturing considerations for their system which may mitigate against potential problems caused by the anticipated environmental variations.  

System Performance:  Vendor will provide typical test data from previously manufactured laser systems for all of the following technical requirements for the purpose of source selection.  Vendor will provide actual test data from the laser system built for AFRL/MNME for all of the following performance requirements as a deliverable.  The Nd:YAG laser will operate at 10 Hz and will provide at least 1.5 Joules per pulse at the 1064 nanometer (nm) fundamental for the secondary function; higher pulse energies are desirable.  Short-term 1064 nm pulse energy variations will not exceed  3 % for 99 % of the pulses over any 1 hour period.  Long-term (8 hour) average 1064 nm pulse energy drift will not exceed  3 %.  Duration of the 1064 nm pulse must fall within the 5 to 10 nanosecond (ns) range.  Timing jitter between the 1064 nm pulse and an externally accessible TTL trigger output signal must not exceed  1 ns.  The 1064 nm laser linewidth will not exceed 0.003 reciprocal-centimeters (cm-1).  The 1064 nm beam near field intensity spatial profile will approximate as closely as possible a top hat or flat top distribution (essential for the secondary application), with over 99 % of the beam energy contained within a 1 cm radius from the beam center.  The pointing stability of the 355 nm OPO pump beam will not exceed  30 micro-radians.  The OPO will provide tunable output covering the 450 nm to 1700 nm wavelength range; a small tuning gap near 710 nm is acceptable, but the absence of such a gap is preferred.  Vendor is invited to propose a wavelength extension option to provide for tunable output into the ultraviolet spectral region.  The OPO will provide pulse energies of at least:  50 milli-Joules (mJ) at 500 nm, 50 mJ at 600 nm, 30 mJ at 800 nm, 10 mJ at 1000 nm, and 5 mJ at 1600 nm.  Short-term OPO pulse energy variations will not exceed  10 % for 99 % of the pulses over any 1 hour period.  Long-term (8 hour) average OPO pulse energy drift will not exceed  10 %.  Duration of the OPO pulse must not exceed 10 ns.  Timing jitter between the OPO pulse and an externally accessible TTL trigger output signal must not exceed  2 ns.  The OPO linewidth must not exceed 0.08 cm-1 throughout the tuning range.  The diameter of the OPO beam (99 % beam energy) will not exceed 1 cm.  The divergence of the OPO beam will not exceed 2 milli-radians.  

Hardware/Software Manuals:  Vendor will include pricing for all technical manuals necessary to operate the proposed hardware and software.   

Serviceability and Warranty:  Vendor is invited to describe any special design or manufacturing considerations for their system which may reduce or eliminate the need for on-site service visits.  Vendor will clearly describe which parts are covered under the standard Warranty, the duration of the standard Warranty, and their estimated daily labor rate for an on-site service visit.  Vendor is invited to propose as an option an extended Warranty plan which will cover all parts, labor, and travel charges for a limited time period.
