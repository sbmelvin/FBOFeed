<SUBJECT>Collection of Data on Doses to Members of the Public Exposed to Patients Treated with Iodine-131
<SOLNBR>NRC-HQ-13-R-04-0167
<RESPDATE>121713
<CONTACT>La'toya Cooper, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 287-0886, Email latoya.cooper@nrc.gov
<DESC><p>Radioactive iodine, mainly the isotope Iodine-131, is used in the diagnosis and treatment of several medical conditions, the primary ones in the present context being treatment of hyperthyroidism and thyroid cancer following thyroidectomy. The importance of these conditions arises from the fact that their treatment protocols generally call for administration of relatively large doses of Iodine-131, and such patients therefore pose the greatest potential for exposure of others.</p>
<p>Patients are often released from the hospital following treatment if they meet the release conditions specified in the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's (NRC) Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 10, Part 35.75, "Release of individuals containing unsealed byproduct material or implants containing byproduct material." The basic criterion underlying the release conditions is that "the total effective dose equivalent to any other individual from exposure to the released individual is not likely to exceed 5 mSv (0.5 rem)."</p>
<p>To assist licensees in implementing the above release requirement, NRC published Regulatory Guide 8.39, "Release of patients administered radioactive materials." This guide provides formulas and tables that are considered acceptable to NRC in translating the basic 5 mSv requirement into operational quantities to be used in releasing patients. For example, an operational quantity used in releasing patients is the dose rate measured at a specified distance from the patient. The formulas and tables in the guide use very conservative assumptions in estimating the dose to an individual that results from exposure to the released patient, but the guide also permits licensees to base their calculations on patient-specific conditions, which are often much less conservative than the generic conditions.</p>
<p>There have been a number of publications in the technical, peer-reviewed literature describing studies that attempted to measure or estimate the doses received by persons coming in contact with released patients, and a preliminary review of some of these publications suggested that the release condition of 5 mSv noted above is being met in practice. However, the NRC Commission has decided that a more extensive review of available data, and a re-examination of the calculation methods and tables described in Regulatory Guide 8.39, shall be conducted to ensure that exposures to members of the public resulting from release of patients according to 10 CFR 35.75 do in fact meet the release criterion, and that the methods used to calculate operational release criteria are reasonably accurate and not excessively conservative. In addition, the Commission instructed staff to generate additional data on exposure of members of the public if the available data is considered to be insufficient to provide reasonable assurance that the release criterion is being met in practice. The objective of tasks under this upcoming solicitation are to undertake, through contracts, to carry out the Commission's directions.</p>
<p>To supplement data found in the available literature on typical exposures to members of the public that are expected to come in proximity of released patients who were treated with high activities of Iodine-131 for hyperthyroidism and thyroid cancer. Exposed persons include personnel at the hotels and nursing homes where patients sometimes stay immediately following their release from the hospital. Measurements made under this task, however, shall only include nursing home and hotel staff. The study shall include collection of data on both external and internal doses, and may involve measurement of doses using personnel dosimetry for external exposures and some form of bioassay for internal exposures.</p>
<p>The resulting contract is expected to be a cost-plus-fixed fee contract. The expected period of performance is 2 years</p>
<p>This procurement is expected to be awarded in Fiscal Year 2014.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) intends solicit proposals under solicitation number NRC-HQ-7G-14-R-0002 for a procurement to provide the NRC with International Regulatory Assistance. The solicitation will be competitive and set-aside for certified vendors under the 8(a) Program. The NAICS code is 541330 with a size standard of $14 million. The contact type will be time-and-materials.
<p>Background</p>
<p>The NRC has been providing regulatory assistance and support to its international counterparts since 1991. The general areas where NRC has focused its technical safety and security assistance and training efforts include currently operating nuclear power and research reactors, nuclear power plants planned or under construction, radioactive waste, nuclear fuel cycle, radioactive sources and fissile materials. At the present time, work involving select countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Middle East, Europe, Latin America, Africa and Asia is either underway or planned for the near future. Continuation of these efforts is anticipated for the next five years, and new needs will likely arise. Currently the NRC's Office of International Programs (OIP), is responsible to support the adoption and implementation of international nuclear safety and security regimes.</p>
<p>Objective</p>
<p>The objective of this procurement is for a contractor to work with OIP to strengthen global nuclear safety and security by supporting efforts of international regulatory counterparts to enhance their regulatory oversight of the use of nuclear and radioactive material.</p>
<p>Scope</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide personnel with specific technical and scientific expertise, including research and development and training, applicable to nuclear safety and security regulations, including operating nuclear power plants, nuclear power plants planned or under construction, radioactive sources, materials and waste, to assist the NRC's Office of International Programs staff in providing a continuous and uninterrupted transfer of nuclear-related assistance to select countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Middle East, Europe, Latin America, Africa and Asia. The Contractor shall also work with OIP to assist international regulatory authorities in:</p>

<SUBJECT>Effects of Internal Distractions on Driving
<SOLNBR>DTNH22-14-R-00037
<RESPDATE>052014
<CONTACT>Sherese A. Gray, Email sherese.gray@dot.gov
<DESC>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is an integral part of the United States Department of Transportation (DOT) and its mission is to save lives, prevent injuries, and reduce traffic-related health care and other economic costs. To accomplish this, NHTSA develops, promotes, and implements effective educational, engineering, and enforcement programs with the goal of ending preventable tragedies and reducing economic costs associated with vehicle use and highway travel.
<p style="BACKGROUND: white">Studies estimate internally-distracted driving, in contrast to externally-distracted driving (e.g. texting), to be the most deadly and least understood form of distracted driving. According to an analysis of 2010-2011 Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) data by Erie Insurance and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (Press Release: April 3, 2012), the number-one cause of distracted driving fatalities was not, as might be expected, talking on a cellular phone or texting; unspecified internal distraction, more commonly termed "mind wandering" in the psychological literature, was the prime culprit. In fact, Erie's analysis found that 62% of all FARS cases involving distracted driving could be attributed to mind wandering. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The second deadliest source of distraction, cell phone use, accounted for 12% of fatalities.</p>
<p style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none">Internal distractions can generally be defined as the decoupling of attention from an individual's perception of the outside world coincident with his or her shift in focus to internal thought processes. Some mind wandering can be consciously directed while some is unintentional. Mind wandering can involve any topic and can last mere seconds or be protracted over many minutes. Regardless of content, length, or intensity, whenever perception and attention is decoupled the risk of looking but not seeing increases.</p>
<p style="BACKGROUND: white">The primary objective of this procurement is to review the current literature and algorithms associated with mind wandering detection and determine the plausibility of using different methods, or combinations of methods to assess the incidence and impact of mind wandering on traffic safety.</p>
<p style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan lines-together; mso-layout-grid-align: none">NHTSA seeks a Contractor to develop a methodology, informed by the literature/algorithm review, to detect the overall incidence of mind wandering in a driving simulator or equipped car. The Contractor will demonstrate and report on their methodologies effectiveness through the use of a pilot study, or with previously acquired simulator/sensor equipped car data.</p>
<p>This acquisition is being offered for full and open competition. The NAICS Code for the anticipated contract is 541720. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Contractors must be registered in the Systems for Award Management Database located at <a href="http://www.sams.gov"><span style="COLOR: windowtext; TEXT-DECORATION: none; text-underline: none">http://www.sams.gov</span></a>, and must complete electronic representations and certification on the ORCA database located at <a href="http://orca.bpn.gov"><span style="COLOR: windowtext; TEXT-DECORATION: none; text-underline: none">http://orca.bpn.gov</span></a> to be considered for contract award.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is the Government's intent to award a Time and Materials type contract resulting from the solicitation, with or without discussions, to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is most advantageous to the Government based on the evaluation factors contained in the solicitation. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>It is the Offeror's responsibility to monitor the FedBizOpps Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any). <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Potential Offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any). Requests for paper copies of the RFP will not be accepted. The estimated date for release of the solicitation is on or about April 18, 2014.</p>
<p style="BACKGROUND: white">Period of Performance:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Base period of twenty four (24) months.</p>
<p style="BACKGROUND: white">Contract Award: The anticipated award date for the resultant contract is expected to be on or about July 2014.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to award a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Contract on a sole source basis to Battelle Memorial Institute in Columbus, OH for the NRE, Validation/Verification, and Production of LED Caution Advisory Panels to address Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages (DMSMS) and obsolete parts in the HH-60H Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) Seahawk Helicopter. The NRE will add two additional rows of light indicators due to the differences between the Navy Seahawk and Army Blackhawk versions of the LED CAP and ensure the enhanced Night Vision Google (NVG) is compatible with the solid-state LED CAP. The new CAP is expected to have higher reliability, reduced maintenance cost, lower cost per unit, and improved performance that is functionally superior to the legacy units. This effort is for an estimated quantity of 37 units: 2 for testing purposes; 2 for validation/verification; and production of 33 retrofit units. <br /><br />This action is being awarded on a sole source basis to Battelle Memorial Institute in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements;" because Battelle owns the design, technical data, and possesses the detail knowledge making the company the only qualified one to perform the NRE, validation/verification, and production of the retrofit units in a timely and cost efficient manner. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, responsible sources may submit a capability statement, which will be considered by NAVAIR. Questions concerning subcontracting opportunities at Battelle should be directed to Ms. Amanda Winkle at (614) 424-4503.<br />

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development, Philippines (USAID/Philippines) intends to release a solicitation for an activity entitled "E-PESO". The purpose of this activity is to facilitate retail e-Payments and promote the technological advancement of the payment system that smoothen economic exchange and value. Emanating from the goal of the broader Partnership for Growth (PFG) of shifting the Philippines to a sustained and more inclusive growth trajectory on par with other high-performing emerging economies, With the emerging shift of retail payments from cash to digital, electronic payment (e-Payment) options stimulate local consumption by easing flow of capital to a larger portion of the population. USAID believes that e-Payments can transform development and facilitate access to economic opportunity that the PFG promises.
<p>E-PESO will expand upon USAID/Philippines' initial mobile money (m-Money) deployment - Scaling Innovations in Mobile Money (SIMM) implemented by the Development Alternatives Inc. (DAI) and the Microenterprise Access to Banking Services (MABS) Phase IV implemented by Chemonics International Inc. - to facilitate the critical mass of e-Payment users that will irreversibly tip the scale towards broad e-Payment usage and widespread adoption. USAID will move from the tactical initiative of its m-Money activities to a more strategic imperative with E-PESO's broader deployment towards a cash-lite society. To accelerate the shift to digital payments, E-PESO will (1) Drive transaction volume of large payment streams; (2) Promote retail and market-level infrastructure; (3) Improve the enabling environment for e-Payments including policies that will promote consumer protection and security measures; and (4) Address gaps in the broader e-Payment ecosystem. These interventions will help scale e-Payment usage towards the threshold of self-sustaining growth, lead to a more efficient, transparent, and inclusive retail e-Payment system, increase the regularity and predictability of financial services to a broader segment of the Philippines population, and eventually open up more economic opportunities for broad-based growth.</p>
<p>The anticipated solicitation date is on or about 14 April 2014. The period of performance is anticipated for a total of five years and is subject to availability of funds.</p>
<p>Except for the above information, no additional information regarding this planned Request for Proposal (RFP) is available at this time. All necessary information will be supplied at the time the RFP is posted at www.fedbizopps.gov. Questions/requests for information will not be responded to until RFP issuance. Interested parties are advised to periodically monitor the above website for updates concerning this procurement. No proposals should be submitted until after the RFP is issued.</p>
<p>The purpose of this notice is to comply with the synopses and pre-solicitation notice requirements for FAR Subpart 5.2, Synopses of Proposed Contract Actions. Any solicitation resulting from this notice will be handled in accordance with FAR 5.102(d). The notice does not obligate USAID to release a solicitation or award a contract nor does it commit the Government to pay for costs incurred in the preparation and submission of a proposal.</p>

<DESC>FBO Synopsis Language
<p>Project Summary Description: The project involves the replacement of two steam fired ASME rated hydronic heat exchangers in the mechanical space of the JC Cleveland FB located in Concord, NH. The heat exchangers will be replaced with government supplied exchangers. The new exchangers are in the mechanical space. The existing condensate return system associated with the heat exchangers will be demolished and a new system will be configured. The existing condensate transfer station will be re-used. The new steam, steam condensate, hot water return and hot water supply lines will be insulated. The new insulated lines will be painted to match the existing building convention. The new lines and the new heat exchangers will be labeled. Any and all local and DDC based instrumentation will be relocated as shown. The electrical power to operate the condensate transfer pumps will be extended to accommodate the new location of the condensate recovery system. The system will be operationally tested once the piping changes are completed.<br /><br />Open to Small Business only.<br /><br />Estimated Cost is between $25,000 and $100,000.<br /><br />The Solicitation will be available on or about April 11, 2014</p>

<DESC>Description of Requirement:  This synopsis is not a request for quotes or proposals.  This is a pre-solicitation notice that a solicitation is scheduled to be released via FedBizOpps (www.fbo.gov) in the near future detailing requirements for Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) Tags.   The PIT Tags needed are glass-encapsulated electronic devices measuring approximately 12-12.5 mm long by 2.0- 2.1 mm in diameter.  The tag can be coded with one of 35 billion unique codes.  As the tagged fish migrates through the hydro system, it passes though electronic interrogation coils established at juvenile detection sites located at federal dams in the Columbia River Basin and other rivers, streams, adult ladders, etc.  Each PIT tag must provide the necessary readability, reliability, high performance standard, and unique codes designed for all detection devices in the Columbia River Basin.  Each tag must satisfy the Corps's requirements without requiring major purchases of new receiver equipment (134-136 kHz range) or compromised reliability.   <br>  <br> Notice to all potential offerors:  the solicitation will require all offerors to ship a lot of 200 tags to the contracting office for independent testing of the PIT Tags.  The lot of 200 tags must be received prior to the closing date specified in the solicitation.   <br>  <br> This announcement is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, implied or otherwise, to issue a solicitation or award a contract. <br>  <br> Set-aside Status:  The solicitation is scheduled to be issued on an unrestricted basis.    The North American Industry Classification System code (NAICS) is 334511 and the related size standard is 750 employees. <br>  <br> Conducting Business with the Government: <br> In order for contractors to conduct business with the Department of Defense, the contractor must provide registration information to the System for Award Management Registration (SAM). All Offerors must be SAM registered prior to receiving an award.  Registration instructions may be obtained and online registration may be accomplished, at www.sam.gov.  By submission of a quote, a vendor acknowledges the requirement to be registered in the SAM database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract resulting from the solicitation.  When available, the solicitation documents for this project will be accessible via FedBizOpps at www.fbo.gov.   No CD's or hard copies will be available.  Offerors are responsible for checking the referenced page for any update(s) to the Notice.  The Government is not responsible for any loss of Internet connectivity or for an offeror's inability to access the document posted at the referenced website.

<DESC>Heavy Combat Crossdrive Transmission (HCCT) Request For Information (RFI) <br>  <br> 1. Market Survey Request. This Request For Information (RFI) is being issued to address the need of a heavy combat cross-drive transmission.  TARDEC will demonstrate a highly power-dense propulsion system designed for a 60-70-ton tracked vehicle to support the long-term powertrain needs of tracked military vehicles.  The propulsion system includes the components and elements necessary to propel the vehicle and produce exportable power (i.e. engine, transmission, final drives, cooling systems, control systems, and electrical generator).  The transmission will be installed to the propulsion system to achieve a system power density of 4.5hp/ft3. <br>  <br> The transmission design should achieve a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 6 by March 2019.  This level is defined as completion of a 75hr durability test.  The design should include architecture which maintains high energy efficiency across the operating speed and load range of the transmission. <br>  <br> 2. Transmission Specifics. The transmission is intended to operate to the following requirements: <br>  <br> 1.	Input Power of 1500 brake-horsepower (BHP) <br> 2.	Pivot steerability <br> 3.	Dead-engine steerability <br> 4.	Regenerative speed-control steering <br>  <br> The transmission will interface with other propulsion system components, their control systems, and their cooling systems.  The transmission architecture will need to be reconfigurable and developed to meet the interface requirements of the other propulsion system components.  Products offered are desired to be already developed or under development.  However, we understand development and modifications of the transmission system may be required. <br>  <br> 3. Proprietary Information. The United States Government (USG) acknowledges its obligation under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (18 U.S.C.  1905) to protect confidential information provided to the Government.  Pursuant to this statute, the USG is willing to accept any trade secrets or proprietary restrictions placed upon data presented in response to this survey and to protect such information from unauthorized disclosure, subject to the following: <br>  <br>  	Data must be clearly marked PROPRIETARY and be accompanied by an explanatory text so that the Government is clearly notified on what data is proprietary. <br>  	Mark only data that is truly confidential. <br>  	Do not mark data that is already in the public domain or is already in possession of the USG or third parties on an unclassified basis.  Do not submit any classified data in response to this market survey. <br>  	Proprietary data transmitted electronically must have the PROPRIETARY legend on both the cover of the transmittal email as well as at the beginning of the file.  Proprietary information contained within the correspondence shall use the legends:  quote mark PROPRIETARY PORTION BEGINS quote mark  and  quote mark PROPRIETARY PORTION ENDS. quote mark  <br>  <br> 4. Disclaimer. This RFI is for a market survey.  It is an inquiry intended to measure the product capability, developmental needs, and level of industry interest.  Responses to this survey may affect the Government's decision to issue the subject contracts for full and open competition.  This is not a pre-solicitation notice or Request for Proposal (RFP), nor will any contracts be awarded from this announcement.  Information provided regarding the potential contracts, as presented in this market survey, is subject to change.  Additionally, this inquiry does not bind the Government to solicit for, or award any contracts.  Participation in this survey from a potential offeror is solely voluntary; no reimbursements will be made to any offeror for costs associated with participation in this survey.  Data submitted to the Government will not be returned, but will remain archived as part of historic records.  Participation in this market survey, while important to Army acquisition planners, is neither mandatory nor is it requisite for future participation by the potential offeror in forthcoming Government solicitations. <br>  <br> 5. Clarification of this Action. The Government is not responsible for the public disclosure of unmarked data received in response to this market survey.  Accordingly, the potential offeror shall ensure that technical data provided in response to this market survey shall be appropriately marked (i.e. proprietary) to ensure proper Government handling of the data.  Should the USG need to reproduce the protected data for distribution purposes between Government offices, all such data will be reproduced with restrictive legends in place. <br>  <br> 6. Questionnaire. Offerors who would be interested in competing for any potential contracts, please take the time to respond to the questionnaire below.  The Government requests that all responses be returned by 5:00pm, Detroit local time on 30-May 2014. <br>  <br> Instructions for Completing the Questionnaire: Interested offerors are asked to complete the following questionnaire and provide answers back electronically to Patty Roussin, Contract Specialist, at patricia.m.roussin.civ@mail.mil. <br>  <br> Response Format: Electronic responses are required.

<DESC><p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1396033953066_1925">This RFI is issued solely for information, planning purposes, and market research only; it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP.&nbsp; This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service.&nbsp; The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is not at this time seeking proposals.&nbsp; The purpose of this RFI is to seek industry information about existing commercially available portable controlled substances and chemical identification system.&nbsp; This RFI is not seeking information about commercially available portable controlled substances and chemical identification systems which are in the developmental phase.<br /><br />DEA consistently seeks to obtain information and comments from industry that will provide the agency with insight into market conditions and/or scientific advances that will aid in the refinements of requirements and the formation of an acquisition strategy for portable controlled substances identification systems.&nbsp; This RFI is designed to conduct market research to determine the current level of technology and availability of such technology in the current market.&nbsp; DEA is interested in obtaining information related to existing, fully developed, and integrated commercially available portable controlled substances identification systems technology described in the following sections.&nbsp; Small businesses are encouraged to respond to this RFI in order to assist DEA in determining the potential level of interest, adequate competition, and technical capability of the Small Business community to fulfill this requirement.&nbsp; However, responses to the RFI are solicited from all interested parties.&nbsp;</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1396033953066_1935">REQUIREMENTS:<br /><br />The DEA has a requirement for a portable controlled substances system that can operate in the field during investigations in which controlled substances are seized.&nbsp; The system must be portable so that investigators can easily transport the system to the location of a seizure, and be of a nature that doesn't require extensive scientific training or certification, and can be operated safely.&nbsp; The system should be robust enough to prevent damage under routine and reasonable use by investigators in the field.&nbsp; The resulting identification must be scientifically sound to support a presumptive identification of the seized substance.&nbsp; The system must have the field capability to positively identify all schedules of controlled substances and listed chemicals commonly seized during the course of criminal investigations, principally traditional pharmaceutical drugs such as synthetic and semi-synthetic opioids, benzodiazepines, amphetamines, and similar, and pre-cursor and other listed chemicals. In addition, this device would ideally be able to detect non-pharmaceutical substances such as heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine, synthetic cathinones and cannabinoids, and others. The system should be able to detect these substances whether in pure form or in combination with other ingredients, and in both powder and pill/tablet form.&nbsp; The system should be able to complete the analysis of the material through clear plastic bags.&nbsp; The system should also include a drug library consisting manufacture's imprints, labels and photographs.</p>
<p>The system should be able to provide immediate results on-site to investigators in a manner that is recordable and reproducible, allowing investigators to download and store reports using commonly utilized software such as Microsoft Word or the like.&nbsp; The report should be erase-protected to ensure that each report file is downloaded for use by investigators as evidence prior to erasure.&nbsp; Likewise, the system should have the ability for investigators to completely erase files from the systems memory with some protection to prevent inadvertent deletion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The system should have an updateable substance identification library which is updated by the manufacturer at frequent intervals.&nbsp;</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1396033953066_1652">User should be able to apply substance identification library updates through downloadable files.</p>
<p>The manufacturer should provide technical support capabilities for the portable controlled substance and chemical identification system.</p>
<p>The system should be covered against manufacturing defects.</p>
<p>RESPONSES:<br /><br />This is a Request for Information (RFI).&nbsp; This is not a solicitation, award or request for proposals and does not obligate the Government to award a contract.&nbsp; The DEA will not be responsible for any cost incurred by interested parties in responding to the RFI.&nbsp; Any and all associated costs shall be expended solely at the expense of the responder.&nbsp; Unsolicited proposals or offers of any kind will not be considered in response to this RFI.&nbsp; All information received in response to this RFI will not be returned.&nbsp; At this time, questions concerning the composition and requirements for a future RFP, as well as those regarding the nature of the services to be performed under any future initiative will not be accepted.&nbsp; Responses must include the following information:</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1396033953066_1949">Company name; mailing address; physical address; point of contact(s); telephone number, fax number; email address; Federal Tax Identification Number, DUNS number; NAICS code; company business size (if small indicate type); and GSA schedule number (if applicable), and must be registered in Systems for Award Management (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.sams.gov/" target="_blank">www.SAMS.gov</a>) to be considered for this requirement.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1396033953066_1948">&nbsp;<span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>A corporate or company capability statement between one and 5 pages that includes relevant experience within the last three years.&nbsp; Relevant experience is defined as possessing the experience described in the "Requirements" section above.&nbsp; The capability statement should include a technical description of the system hardware and maintenance and other contractor support services required for the Government use and support of all items related to the system.&nbsp;<br /><span><br />2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>A representative sample of contracts your firm was awarded to provide the requirements as described in this notice within the past three years.&nbsp; For each contract listed include the type of contract; total estimated value; contract period of performance (e.g., base and number of option periods); customer (i.e. federal agency) and respective point of contact (e.g., point of contact's name, phone number, and email address).<br /><span><br />3.<span>&nbsp;</span></span>Published documentation about the system to include manuals, white papers and other technical documentation (if available).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Government encourages creativity and innovation in responses to the RFI.&nbsp; Any questions about this RFI should be submitted in writing to John Girard no later than 11:00 a.m. local Eastern Standard Time on April 4, 2014.&nbsp; Answers to general questions will be provided under an amendment to the RFI and posted on FBO.&nbsp; Answers to vendor specific questions will be provided directly to vendors.&nbsp; Interested parties are requested to submit the above requested information directly via e-mail to: John.C.Girard@usdoj.gov no later than 11:00 a.m. local Eastern Standard Time on April 11, 2014.&nbsp; Any responses received after the closing date will not be considered.&nbsp; No literature will be returned to responding sources and each source is solely responsible for all expenses associated with submitting their literature.&nbsp; All information will be kept confidential and will not be disseminated to the public.&nbsp; This sources sought synopsis neither constitutes a Request for Proposal (RFP), nor does it restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach.&nbsp; This synopsis should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose.&nbsp; Request for a solicitation will not receive a response.</p>

<DESC>NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) intends to issue sole source procurements to the following companies as described: Northrop Grumman Electronic Systems - Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS), three units; Exelis  Cross-Track Infrared Sounder (CrIS), three units; Raytheon Space and Airborne Systems  Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), two units; Ball Aerospace and Technologies Corporation  Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS), two units. <p> At the inception of the JPSS program, the intent was to manifest the same instruments on the JPSS-1 and JPSS-2 missions. The plans for JPSS-3 and JPSS-4 were undefined at the time, but in the intervening 18 months, NOAA has determined that the same instrument suite will meet its observational needs for those missions. NOAA has also determined that continuity of JPSS capabilities is sufficient to meet National Weather Service needs beyond 2028, and that it will be difficult to obtain the necessary budget increases for all new instrument designs before 2030.  Sole-source procurements are thus sought for the instruments to be manifested on JPSS-3, JPSS-4 and a spare for early satellite or launch vehicle failure risk mitigation.  Specifically, the planned JOFOC is for three each of ATMS and CrIS, and two each of VIIRS, and OMPS.  The proposed procurements are for the instruments only, as the spacecraft will be procured separately. <p> Statutory authority for this sole source procurement is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1)  Only One Responsible Source. However, any organization who believes they can provide these items without any detrimental impact to the program mission should fully identify their interest and capabilities within 15 days after publication of the synopsis. <p> Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform any of these efforts in writing to the identified point of contact no later than 5:00 pm EST on April 11, 2014. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. <p> All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. <p> Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. <p> The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. See Note 26. An Ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA Specific Note B. Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<DESC>SOLICITATION NUMBER: HHS-NIH-NIDA-SS132
<p>TITLE: Microfluidizer Processor</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION<br />This is a Sources Sought notice.<br />This is NOT a solicitation, request for proposals (RFP), proposal abstracts, nor a request for quotations (RFQ).</p>
<p>The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources that includes; (1) other than small businesses (large businesses, education institutions, non-profits, etc.); (2) small businesses sources; (3) HubZone small businesses; (4) service-disabled small businesses; (5) veteran-owned small businesses; (6) 8(a) small businesses; (7) veteran-owned small businesses; (8) woman-owned small businesses; (9) small disadvantaged businesses; and (10) private contractors and consultants, who can perform the requirements of the size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code as specified below.</p>
<p>This notice is issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes. No award will be made as a result of this notice. The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice. The notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.</p>
<p>The information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a small business social-economic set-aside, competitive or non-competitive method is possible, and to determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government's requirement.</p>
<p>ALL organizations with the capability and availability to perform the requirement under the applicable NAICS code are invited to submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>NORTH AMERICAN CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE<br />The NAICS code applicable to this requirement is 541712 - RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN THE PHYSICAL, ENGINEERING, AND LIFE SCIENCES (EXCEPT BIOTECHNOLOGY)<br />and the associated small business size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p><br />PROJECT BACKGROUND/DESCRIPTION<br />This acquisition is necessary for preparation of cytoskeletal regulatory proteins purified and characterized in the laboratory. We routinely need to lyse bacterial and yeasts cells in order to purify our proteins of interest. The proteins that we purify using this microfluidizer are important for advancing our understanding of the basic physical chemical phenomena that underpin the function of human cells in health and defined thus: "Our mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce the burdens of illness and disability."</p>
<p>CONTRACTORS REQUIREMENT<br />The microfluidizer uses the patented technology of Microfluidics fixed-geometry fluid processors. The processors disrupt cells by forcing the cell sample at high pressure through a proprietary interaction chamber containing a narrow channel that generates the highest shear rates commercially available. The ultra-high shear rates allow for: processing of more difficult samples, fewer repeat passes to ensure optimum sample processing. It should be noted that the Microfluidizer&reg; systems provide a highly reproducible, convenient, and efficient method for cell lysis. The fixed geometry of the interaction chamber offers direct scalability from laboratory scale (20 ml) to production scale (several liters) with a short processing time and without the possibility of cross contamination between samples.

<DESC><strong>Description<br /></strong><br />The department of Health and Human Services, The Office of Human Services Emergency Preparedness and Response (OHSEPR) within the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) exists to strengthen our nation's emergency response and recovery system through the integration and delivery of human services to persons affected by disasters. ACF, in partnership with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), provide Immediate Disaster Case Management (IDCM) services to states affected by both natural and man-made disasters utilizing a National contractor to provide case management services. We are looking for highly qualified organizations capable of conducting DCM operations to support both federal and state agencies in the recovery of disasters.
<p><strong>Background<br /></strong><br />ACF administers federal programs that promote the economic and social well-being of families, children, individuals, and communities. ACF programs aim to achieve the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Empower families and individuals to increase their economic independence and productivity<br />&bull; Encourage strong, healthy, supportive communities that have a positive impact on quality of life and the development of children<br />&bull; Create partnerships with front-line service providers, states, localities and tribal communities to identify and implement solutions that transcend traditional program boundaries<br />&bull; Improve access to services through planning, reform and integration<br />&bull; Address the needs, strengths and abilities of vulnerable populations including the elderly, displaced children without parents, people with developmental disabilities, refugees and migrants</p>
<p>Post Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, it became apparent that individuals and families impacted by disasters often require disaster case management services to regain self-sufficiency and return to a pre-disaster state. However, at the time, there was no Federal authority to fund disaster case management as part of a Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act) declaration. As a result, Congress passed the Post Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 (PKEMRA) which "grants the President authority to provide case-management services, including financial assistance to state or local government agencies or private organizations to provide such services, to survivors of major disasters".</p>
<p>Much has been accomplished since 2006 to improve human service preparedness delivery for a disaster, including the provision of disaster case management for individuals and families. Many States, human service organizations, and Voluntary Agencies Active in Disaster (VOAD) have developed plans that include provisions of, or support for, disaster case management. However, there are still many States that do not have the capacity or plans for disaster case management. Most plans assume that human services will be delivered to those adversely impacted by disaster by existing agencies at the state or local level with some federal assistance and that case management will be either delivered by those same agencies or supported by voluntary agencies and faith-based groups within the impacted area. However, when a major disaster occurs and then impacts thousands of individuals or families, the ability of those agencies within the impacted area to provide disaster case management services could be compromised. Therefore, it is necessary to have a plan to support States and local communities in a manner that will fill existing gaps identified by the State, until the State is able to implement their own case management program. In 2007, to address the issue of providing disaster case management, meetings were held with some of the Nation's foremost experts in disaster case management. These meetings were hosted by the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) through support from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR). The purpose of OHSEPR is to focus attention on human services preparedness and response activities after a disaster has occurred. One of the primary goals of OHSEPR is to promote self-sufficiency of individuals, families, and access and functional needs populations prior to, during and after disasters.</p>
<p>The Federal Government, to the maximum extent possible endeavors to prepare for and reduce a disaster's impact on existing service delivery to citizens by assisting and connecting disaster clients to services. Quickly linking disaster clients to appropriate resources and assistance will most likely reduce the disaster survivor's dependency for more intensive healthcare and traditional social service benefits; thus reducing the impact on states and existing programs.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose<br /><br /></strong>The purpose of this sources sought notification is to identify sources that can provide Immediate Disaster Case Management services to individuals impacted by a disaster at the request of an affected State or Tribal government. Responding sources are being ask to show their ability to advance a statement of work that enables the federal government to provide trained, screened and credentialed disaster management assets that are able to deploy within seventy-two (72) hours following notification by ACF of a request for Immediate Disaster Case Management (IDCM) services.</p>

<SUBJECT>Next Generation Remote Vehicle (NGRV)
<SOLNBR>DTRT5714SS00004
<RESPDATE>041414
<CONTACT>Thomas A. Wilga, Contract Specialist, Phone 6174942177, Email thomas.wilga@dot.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT) Office of the Secretary of Transportation-Research, John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center), Cambridge, MA, is seeking to identify sources capable of developing a Next Generation Remote Vehicle (NGRV) in order to assess the requirements for such devices that will be used to conduct future testing of motor vehicle crash warning and avoidance applications using various on-board sensor technologies and vehicle-to-vehicle communications. The use of crash avoidance systems in connected vehicles is a potential solution to address approximately 4.4 million annual police-reported automotive crashes. Crash avoidance systems encompass safety applications that warn the driver of crash-imminent situations and apply automatic controls to prevent or reduce the impact severity of the crash. Target crash types include rear-end, lane-change, opposite-direction, and junction crossing-path collisions. Testing of these crash warning and avoidance applications is inherently dangerous due to the crash-imminent scenarios to which the drivers and vehicles are exposed in order to gather useful data about their crash avoidance capability. Because of this danger, testing of these safety applications is currently limited only to those scenarios that can be conducted safely. The Volpe Center is providing support to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to develop requirements for a NGRV that can safely be used in testing crash avoidance systems under a multitude of crash-imminent scenarios and conditions. This research meets NHTSA's mission to save lives, prevent injuries, and reduce health care and other economic costs associated with motor vehicle crashes.
<p>In support of this effort, the Volpe Center requires an NGRV that may be used as a strike able remote vehicle for future safe testing of crash warning, crash avoidance, and crash mitigation safety applications on closed-course test tracks. The primary requirement of the NGRV is that it must mimic a light vehicle (e.g., passenger car) visually and be recognized by various sensor technologies while also being able to be struck by another light vehicle (i.e., host vehicle of the safety applications) without causing injury or harm to either the vehicle or any human drivers involved. The NGRV must perform routine driving maneuvers with no human operator onboard with the same dynamics as a typical light vehicle that includes passing, changing lanes, merging, turning, decelerating, and accelerating actions at different speeds on curved and straight roads typical of highway and arterial driving. The NGRV will be used as the remote vehicle in crash-imminent scenarios in coordination with a host vehicle to safely test crash-warning and avoidance applications based on vehicle-to-vehicle Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) and using remote sensors such as imaging, laser, or radar. Due to the high risk of collisions between the remote and host vehicles during testing, the NGRV must not require the presence of a human driver to operate. In addition, the NGRV must be able to be struck by a host light vehicle (i.e., gross vehicle weight rating under 10,000 pounds) during testing from any direction without causing any damage to either vehicle. Moreover, the NGRV must be re-buildable after being struck within a reasonable amount of time so that multi-run testing of specific scenarios can be resumed with minimal effort. The NGRV must also have a mechanism to abort the active maneuver and come to an immediate stop or perform an evasive maneuver if the conditions are deemed unsafe. Finally, the NGRV must provide internal space and power connections to allow the installation of a differential GPS ground truth positioning system and a DSRC radio required for testing.</p>
<p>Interested sources must submit a capabilities package demonstrating their past and current experience related to the development of an NGRV. Information provided shall be of sufficient detail for the Government to assess the ability of your company to develop /provide the NGRV described above. All Offeror capability information shall include the following: contract number; customer (DOD agency, other Government agency, private industry); for government contracts, the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) name, telephone number and email address; for private industry contracts, the point of contact (POC); contract value, and type of contract; period of performance; and a description of product/services. All of the information should be conveyed in no more than five (5) pages. Font size should be between 11-12 with page size set at 8 X 11, doubled spaced in either Microsoft Word or PDF. Each response must reference the sources sought title. The NAICS code for this acquisition is 336999 and the small business size standard is 500 employees. In accordance with the NAICS code provided, all Offerors must state whether they are a large or small business. Offerors are requested to provide their DUNS and CCR numbers.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS <br> Repair Scouring Holes, MKARNS  <br> Ozark Lock and Dam No. 12, James W. Trimble Lock & Dam No. 13, and Dardanelle Lock & Dam No. 10 <br> Arkansas, White, and Verdigris Rivers <br>  <br>  <br> This is a SOURCES SOUGHT announcement; a market survey for information only, to be used for preliminary planning purposes.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this synopsis or any follow up information requests.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers - Little Rock District has been tasked to solicit for and award a Spall Repair by the preplaced aggregate methodology at McClellan Kerr River Navigation System, Arkansas.  The work includes repair of eroded concrete, in the wet, in the following areas; end sill on the lock wall side, stilling basin near the lock wall, lock wall (river side) from the intersection of the lock wall and end sill and downstream.  Due to complex geometries, the only cost efficient concrete repair is accomplished using the placement method of preplaced-aggregate.  This includes, but is not limited to, the following processes:  existing concrete surfaces to which preplaced-aggregate concrete will bond should be thoroughly cleaned and all deteriorated concrete removed, as well as the removal of any exposed, embedded reinforcement and debris in the void; anchoring and placement of additional reinforcement into sound concrete; placement of coarse aggregate within the eroded area; erection and anchoring of water-tight formwork with adequate grout and vent pipes; design of the grout to be used in the repair; mixing and pumping of grout into the voids of the preplaced coarse aggregate; cure and finish of concrete repair; use of divers and/or acoustical imaging to verify repair results; cleanup of site, and incidental related work.  <br>  <br> Proposed project will be a competitive, firm-fixed price, design/bid/build contract procured in accordance with FAR 15, Contracting by Negotiations.   The type of set-aside decision to be issued will depend upon the capabilities of the responses to this synopsis. <br>   <br> The purpose of this synopsis is to gain knowledge of interest, capabilities and qualifications of various members of industry, to include the Small Business Community: Small Business, Section 8(a), Historically Underutilized Business Zones (HUB-Zone), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB).

<SOLNBR>
<CONTACT>
<DESC>Contract No. R14PC00004
TAS:  14 0680
This J&A is also available for viewing at http://www.usbr.gov/mso/aamd/doing-business-acquisitions-noncompetitive.html FAR 6.302-1 - Only one responsible source and not other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.
Riverbottom Farms, Inc. (Riverbottom) is the cooperative farmer for Cibola National Wildlife Refuge (CNWR) and is responsible for setting the irrigation schedules for over 1500 acres of farm fields.  As cooperative farmer, Riverbottom controls, maintains, and provides the irrigation for the entire area and currently employees a full time staff to provide farming and irrigation to the CNWR.  Integration and coordination of the irrigation requirements for both the active farm fields and restoration projects is critical and cannot be separated.  Riverbottom Farms is responsible for the upkeep of the irrigation system as well as the release and management of the water delivered for irrigation.
Riverbottom is currently the only cooperative farmer authorized by CNWR to farm, manage and irrigate these fields.  As the cooperative farmer for CNWR, they have been provided a staging area for their equipment and therefore currently have all the needed equipment readily available for this requirement.  Since Riverbottom has equipment readily available to use for the Reclamation requirement, this would be a significant cost savings to the Government as there will not be any mobilization costs.  Also there currently is no additional space available on the CNWR for equipment to be stored, therefore requiring all other contractors to remove their equipment daily and store at an offsite facility.  Having to mobilize equipment on a daily basis would be large expense.

<CONTACT>Joel L. Perlroth, Program Management Specialist, Phone (301) 713-9204 x143, Fax (301) 713-9219, Email joel.l.perlroth@noaa.gov
<DESC><br />Introduction<br />The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) is soliciting industry input to improve our understanding of existing and potential options to deploy atmospheric remote sensing instruments to mitigate the loss of data should a failure occur in polar satellite coverage provided by the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS).  NOAA's current polar and geosynchronous orbiting satellites collect critical data for the U.S. National Weather Service (NWS) and other national users.  The JPSS microwave and infrared sounders produce global vertical temperature, moisture, and pressure profiles that provide critical input to the NWS numerical weather prediction models.  Though these models incorporate data from multiple sources, a gap in JPSS sounding data would reduce their accuracy.  This RFI focuses only on options for mitigating a possible loss of data and does not affect the current JPSS program.
<p>NOAA/NESDIS has an immediate interest in understanding options for rapidly deploying assets that provide Earth observational capabilities to mitigate the impact of a gap in data from the JPSS sounders on a best value basis that balances observational needs with rapid deployment time and low cost.  NOAA is interested in options with performance that replaces or sustains current performance ("gap filler") as well as options with partial performance ("gap mitigation").  NOAA will use industry responses to this RFI to inform near-term programmatic planning as well as long-term strategic planning to define what may follow the current JPSS program.</p>
<p>The Government for Planning Purposes is seeking a Request for Information (RFI) only, and does not obligate the government to reimburse any costs associated with the preparation and/or submission of this information.  Nor does this RFI guarantee that the government will issue your company a request for proposal or award a contract for supplies or services.  No specific RFP is planned to follow this RFI; however, the responses could impact the government's decision to release an RFP in the future.</p>
<p>Request for Information<br />This RFI focuses on:</p>
<p>1.  Atmospheric sounding data with the capability and performance the same as, or comparable to, the currently operating Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS) and/or Cross-Track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) weather instruments.</p>
<p>2.  Low-cost methods for providing the spacecraft and the launch vehicle for rapid deployment of the JPSS ATMS and/or CrIS instruments or alternatives within a year from call up.</p>
<p>3.  Comparable global atmospheric profiles that do not fully meet the current requirements, and in particular, approaches that include new technologies that show promise for lowering costs in the future.</p>
<p>The relevant JPSS requirements are attached as supplemental documentation.  The first document is the Level 1 Requirements document for the JPSS Program.  The 2nd document is the Supplemental, more details on the requirements.  Submitters will be particularly interested in sections 4.1 and 4.3, as that's where we address the requirements for the ATMS and CrIS instruments.</p>
<p>1.  JPSS_L1RD-FINAL_v1_7_RevA10<br />2.  JPSSL1RDS-F_v29RevA</p>
<p>NOAA is interested in innovative cost-effective methods to obtain these gap filler and/or gap mitigation capabilities, and in particular, specific risk/cost trades.  These could include:</p>
<p>1.  More efficient acquisition models for procuring the   flight segment</p>
<p>2.	Streamlined oversight methods</p>
<p>3.	Accepting more risk</p>
<p>NOAA is interested in capabilities that would be on-orbit or could launch rapidly to bridge the possibility of a 3-year gap in the event of a failure.  This includes options that could provide this operational data at any time during JPSS's nominal operational period from now through 2038, with a particular focus on the early 2020s when the lifetime of current on-orbit assets is exceeded.  Respondents may offer solutions that leverage existing ground resources or alternative solutions that comply with best practices for information technology.  In all cases, the solutions must provide data products that support NOAA's numerical weather prediction models.  <br />Respondents are hereby notified that NOAA may share responses with other government agencies, especially the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and that the government may utilize Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) to provide technical advice and evaluate responses.  All personnel assigned to assist in the RFI assessment will sign both nondisclosure and conflict of interest forms and will be made aware that responses shall not be duplicated, used, or disclosed in whole or in part for any purpose other than to consider the response.</p>
<p>Submittal Instructions</p>
<p>RFI responses must be received in soft copy no later than 10:00 am Eastern Time, 30 days following the date of this RFI, which is the date of its posting.  The government is not obligated to review responses to this RFI received after the deadline.  Submissions are limited to not more than 15 pages, including supporting appendices, title page(s), all graphics, pictures and figures.  A page is defined as each face of an 8 1/2 by 11 inch sheet with information contained within an image area of 7 by 9 inches.  Type size shall be 12 point proportional font.  Information shall be submitted in Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat (PDF) format.  Follow the instructions posted for specific soft copy submittal instructions.</p>
<p>Issues and questions regarding this RFI shall be submitted to Joel Perlroth at Joel.L.Perlroth@noaa.gov until the time and date it is due.  The government will entertain questions on a case-by-case basis.  Respondents should be advised that all questions submitted will be posted to FedBizOps as an amendment for all respondents to review, although the identity of the requesting organization will be withheld.  Respondents may reply to some of all of the RFI.</p>
<p>If contractors decide not to respond to this RFI, it will not preclude them from submitting a proposal for any subsequent NOAA or NASA work.</p>
<p>The government would like to thank all respondents in advance for expending the time and resources in support of this critical activity.</p>

<DESC>The United States Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) at Fort Detrick, MD intends to issue a sole source award utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures to Executive Information Systems Inc. for SAS Software Licenses. <br>  <br>      SAS is a unique statistical software package published by SAS Institute Inc. used by investigators and technical staff to provide predictive analytics for research studies and protocols. This procurement will keep the software up to date at the current version and to allow technical support via phone should it be necessary. A letter was obtained from SAS Institute Inc. ( quote mark SAS quote mark ) stating that it is the sole manufacturer and publisher of SAS software. Eligible government entities may license the Software and obtain subsequent maintenance from an authorized reseller of the software. Currently, Executive Information Systems, LLC ( quote mark EIS quote mark ) with offices at 6901 Rockledge Drive, Suite 600, Bethesda, Maryland 20817, is SAS' sole authorized reseller for Version 8 and later of the Software to such government entities.   <br>  <br>      This notice of intent is for information purposes only, therefore, no solicitation will result from this announcement. All sources eligible to provide this service must respond in writing. Responses must be supported with clear and convincing evidence to clearly be able to provide services outlined above. A request for documentation will not be considered as an affirmative response. If no responses are received, within 15 days, 14 April 2014, after publication of this notice, to the effect that comparable services are available, and that it is more advantageous to the Government than obtaining these services through a sole-source contract, then a sole source acquisition award will be made.

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   

No other sources exist for organ procurement. "The Center for Organ Recovery & Education (CORE) is one of 58 federally designated not-for-profit organ procurement organizations (OPO) in the United States. In addition to supporting families during the grieving process and talking with them about the opportunity to donate the agency also notifies the organ transplant team and coordinates the surgical recovery of organs tissue and eyes. CORE also is responsible for facilitating the computerized matching of donated organs and placement of corneas. Founded in 1977 as the Transplant Organ Procurement Foundation of Western Pennsylvania, CORE changed to its existing name in 1992 to reflect its expanding role in the procurement field. With headquarters in Pittsburgh, CORE is a well-established OPO. Its assigned region encompasses 155 hospitals and more than six million people throughout Western Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Chemung County, NY".

"Each of the hospitals in CORE's designated region serves as a referral site for potential donors. Five of the hospitals also perform life-saving organ transplants: Allegheny General Hospital, Charleston Area Medical Center, Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and Veteran's Administration Pittsburgh Health System."

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable: 

 CORE has one of the lowest fees for procured organs nationally.

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  

CORE has one of the lowest fees for procured organs nationally.

Not applicable.

. This acquisition will be accomplished using commercial procedures in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 15 and in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, for Other Than Full & Open Competition. The Contracting Officer believes that it is in the best interest of the government to continue operations with this company for another six months of service to complete jobs that have been delayed by construction and renovation delays. It is expected that the government will benefit from continuity of service until the projects are completed. While this is not a request for offers, the Contracting Officer would appreciate knowing about other contractors doing business in VISN 4 who could offer this service. A determination to compete this procurement will be based on responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. The anticipated date of award is April 1, 2014. Please direct all inquiries and responses to the Procurement Analyst, referencing VA244-14-C-0206.

<DESC>Washington Headquarters Services / Acquisition Directorate (WHS/AD) intends to award a follow-on sole source contract to SRA INTERNATIONAL, INC., 4300 FAIR LAKES CT, FAIRFAX VA 22033-4232; the current order number is HQ0034-09-F-3001. This contract is planned to be awarded NLT 01 May 2014 for a base of six months and two option periods of three months each.<br /><br />The contract action is due to an unanticipated Life Safety Backbone (LSB) outage and will provide continued support for the Pentagon Force Protection Agency's (PFPA) Life Safety System Network (LSSN) and upgrade/repair of the Life Safety Backbone (LSB) network which provides access to the mission-critical systems needed to properly safeguard personnel and facilities across the National Capital Region (NCR). As a result of the LSB network outage PFPA, with SRA, has developed a four-phased approach:<br /><br />&bull; Phase #1 - Immediate recovery of the LSB; <br />&bull; Phase #2 - Update the existing LSB Network Core devices<br />&bull; Phase #3 - Replace existing LSB Network Core devices<br />&bull; Phase #4 - Replace existing LSB outer edge devices.<br /><br />Awarding the proposed contract to another source would result in unacceptable delays and substantial additional costs to the Government, as the new source would require time to develop the skills needed to meet PFPA's immediate requirements. Based on the time constraint and expected increase in cost inherent to awarding to another contractor, it is not in the best interest of the Government to award to any vendor other than SRA.<br /><br />This proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(A). This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A competitive follow-on will be issued after the existing LSB network is upgraded. As a result of this proposed short-term contract action, solicitation number HQ0034-14-R-0015 will be cancelled. <br /><br />THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. The Government does not intend to pay for information provided in response to this publication. Written responses to this synopsis shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bona fide capability to fulfill this requirement. All interested parties shall submit clear and convincing documentation demonstrating their capabilities to satisfy the requirements listed above to Tequilla Wheeler by email at tequilla.n.wheeler.civ@mail.mil. The capability documentation should include general information and technical background describing in detail the prospective contractor's capabilities and experience that will demonstrate the ability to support these requirements.<br />

Schedule B unit prices shall be limited to two decimal places. <br />b. Identify a CLIN/SLIN (Contract Line Item/Sub Line Item) as Not Separately Priced by entering "NSP" in the unit price. Identify a CLIN/SLIN as No Charge by entering "NC" in the unit price.<br />c.

<p>(c) Period of Acceptance of Offers. The Offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 120 days from the date specified for receipt of offers.</p>

Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided.

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. The basis for award will be use of best value in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award a CSA for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:</p>
<p>Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>
<p>(x) Complete all representations and certifications electronically at the following website: https://sam.gov/. If not completed on-line, Offerors must include a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3, which can be obtained at http://farsite.hill.af.mil, FAR Part 52 or online at https://sam.gov/. In addition, complete the following Addendum I to 52.212-3:<br /><br />52.212-3 Addendum, Certification to Accept the Government Purchase Card (GPC).

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'">(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'">(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'">(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers.

<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'">(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors.

The Office of Criminal Justice Assistance and Partnership (INL/CAP) provides technical assistance to INL program offices in addressing the full range of criminal justice development issues in over 70 partner countries around the globe. INL/CAP assists INL in developing strategic partnerships with U.S. state, county, municipal, and federal law enforcement, justice sector, and corrections agencies and institutions to bring up-to-date and relevant expertise to bear in INL programs. INL/CAP also conducts pre-deployment training for many of INL's advisors before they deploy to their assignments.</p>
<p>Criminal justice assistance is a core component of rule of law development, which is critical to helping countries fight destabilizing crime and corruption and promoting good governance. Currently, INL manages criminal justice programs in numerous countries, employing hundreds of people in the field to implement these programs. Programs include deployment of American experts in the fields of policing, corrections, and justice to multilateral stabilization and reconstruction missions, including direct secondment of U.S. officers to United Nations missions; bilateral programs to train and build capacity of justice sector institutions, deployment of mentors or other technical advisors, and provision of infrastructure and equipment.</p>
<p>Purpose<br />The INL Training Coordinator (TC) is responsible for the design, development, delivery, and evaluation of a comprehensive and tailored pre-deployment training program(s) for INL's police, corrections and justice trainers and advisors deploying to assignments in INL Programs. The TC is responsible for the management and supervision of a team of up to three full time instructors and program support staff. In performing this function, the TC is required to work with INL program officers to actively identify INL program pre-deployment training requirements, coordinate training with INL program offices, with the UN and other multilateral organizations, with DOS and other USG entities, and identify appropriate, qualified subject matter experts (SMEs) to assist with curriculum development and deliver instruction as needed. The TC will also oversee pre-deployment classes when in session, liaise with the training facility and contract service providers, maintain contracts for training center and staff functions and oversee contract personnel on the training team.

<p>4. Oversees all contractor staff and activities at the training center. Works with training team staff to achieve excellence and promotes good teamwork.

<p>6. Provides analysis and evaluation of the appropriateness and effectiveness of the pre-deployment training program.</p>
<p>7. Maintains and applies to pre-deployment training a working knowledge of contemporary, professional adult centric training and education principles, methods and techniques.</p>
<p>8. Participates in outreach activities with domestic and international law enforcement, think-tank communities, academies, universities and professional associations to increase awareness of INL programs and to make formal and informal information sharing and resource development.</p>

The Incentive Agreement (IA) resulting from this RFIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor (PV) Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access the web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil/<br /><br />This RFIAQ is intended to solicit pricing quotes from vendors who are on the <strong>QSL MW-1202-26_Safety_Lancets_Adult</strong>. The pricing that is provided must be discounted from DAPA prices or proposed DAPA prices. Vendors who are currently qualified for the QSL must meet the requirements below. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection, with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is October 2013.

<DESC><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistic Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Request for Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFIAQ) for the standardization of Fluid Solidifiers. Vendors who qualified for the Qualified Suppliers List (QSL) MP-1201-22_Fluid_Solidifiers are eligible for participation. The MMESO Pacific is the lead MMESO for this project.</strong>
<p>These Fluid Solidifiers products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. The Incentive Agreement (IA) resulting from this RFIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor (PV) Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access the web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil/</p>
<p>This RFIAQ is intended to solicit pricing quotes from vendors who are on the QSL MP-1201-22_Fluid_Solidifiers. The pricing that is provided must be discounted from DAPA prices or proposed DAPA prices. Vendors who are currently qualified for the QSL must meet the requirements below. The resulting IA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection, with three (3) 12-month "option" periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. <strong>Anticipated selection date is December 2013. Among vendors who are on the QSL MP-1201-22_Fluid_Solidifiers, best price will determine selection. It is intended that the selected vendor(s) for this IA will support the enterprise goal of medical materiel standardization that combines operational and institutional requirements. The government is seeking a single vendor selection for an IA.</strong> The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Fluid Solidifiers.</p>
<p>A. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Fluid Solidifiers. The total estimated enterprise-wide annual demand for this product line is approximately $415,559.85 based on Medical Product Data Bank (MedPDB) usage data over a recent 12-month period.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Sellers must present their representations and certifications, upon request, through the System for Award Management at http://sam.gov <BR> <BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

Quotes will be evaluated based on price and technical acceptability.  Quoter certifies that the product quoted meets or exceeds all minimum requirements as stated in the Request for Quotes. <BR> <BR>Quotes must be submitted per unit price and total price.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ???6212,which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ???6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing,and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ???6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Sellers must present their representations and certifications, upon request, through the System for Award Management at http://sam.gov <BR> <BR>The award decision is based on Lowest Price Technically Acceptable. The contractor's Past Performance will be reviewed. Companies that have negative past performance shall not be awarded the contract. The price will be determined fair and reasonable IAW Far Part 13.106 <BR> <BR>

Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.<br />(c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.<br />(d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the sender's request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing.<br />(e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.<br />(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers.<br /> (1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.<br /> (2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and-<br /> (A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or<br /> (B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or<br /> (C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.<br />(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.<br /> (3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.<br /> (4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.<br /> (5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers.

The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.<br />(h) Multiple awards.

<p>FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items.   (Jan 1999)<br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.

<p>1    The facility must have parking available for 135 vehicles.<br />2.   The facility must be located within 1/4 mile of the Bureau of Fiscal Service facilities located at 401 14th Street, SW, Washington, DC 20227 <br />3.

Offerors shall provide demonstrated experience in work efforts similar in scope, and relevancy to the requirements outlined in the SOW.  The data can include information on contracts on which the offeror, or any proposed subcontractor has performed, or is performing, as a prime contractor or subcontractor.</p>

Surveys shall be sent back to the Government prior to being considered for award. Surveys shall be returned to the point of contact identified on the form within the time frame allotted.</p>
<p>NOTE:  In the event that an offeror has no Past Performance history, (e.g. a new firm), this rating factor will be considered neutral and will neither increase an offeror's overall rating nor decrease</p>
<p>In accordance with Executive Order 13589 - Promoting Efficient Spending, preference will be given to those offerors that offer space controlled by the Federal Government.</p>
<p>Technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p><br />52.209-5 Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010)</p>
<p>(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-</p>
<p>(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-</p>
<p>(A) Are __ are not __ presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(B) Have __ have not __, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation);</p>
<p>(C) Are __ are not __ presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision;</p>
<p>(D) Have __, have not __, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(2) Examples.</p>
<p>(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect; 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect; 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect; 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(ii) The Offeror has __ has not __, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.</p>
<p>(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).</p>
<p>This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.</p>
<p>(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.</p>
<p>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.</p>
<p>(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.</p>
<p>(End of provision)</p>
<p><br />52.209-7  Information Regarding Responsibility Matters (Jul 2013)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. As used in this provision-</p>
<p>"Administrative proceeding" means a non-judicial process that is adjudicatory in nature in order to make a determination of fault or liability (e.g., Securities and Exchange Commission Administrative Proceedings, Civilian Board of Contract Appeals Proceedings, and Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals Proceedings). This includes administrative proceedings at the Federal and State level but only in connection with performance of a Federal contract or grant.

<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0.5in 0pt 0in; TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">This notice is a combined Synopsis/Solicitation, Notice of Intent for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, quotes are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Mountain West Medical &amp; Laboratory, Inc. 3885 US Highway 93 N, Stevensville, MT 59870-6526 under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-72 dated January 30, 2014.&nbsp;This firm-fixed price acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a Total Small Business Set-Aside. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 811219&nbsp;and the small business size is $19.0 million.<br /><br />This requirement is&nbsp;a follow-on action for replacement components on autoclaves, bottle washers, bottle filters, and cage washers which are needed for on-site preventative maintenance and emergency repair performed under an existing service contract. Requirement specifications are provided in the attached Bill of Materials. As this equipment ages, the Rocky Mountain Laboratories (RML) is experiencing significant increases in the number of components that require replacement in order to remain functional. The remaining parts and materials balance on the current service contract is not adequate to absorb the cost of the parts and materials required to keep several equipment systems functioning and still support other critical repairs and/or parts needed to maintain sterilization equipment on the RML campus.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Mountain West Medical currently provides the on-site preventative maintenance and emergency repairs to this equipment under an existing service contract. The Contractor is responsible for repair and replacement of worn or unserviceable parts and components. As this service need is critical, Mountain West Medical is the one source responsible for currently providing the components and maintenance of this equipment. Obtaining additional parts and materials from Mountain West Medical prevents substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. This follow-on order with the existing contractor allows for the most effective use of resources. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (USDOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric and Administration (NOAA), and Atlantic Oceanic and Meteorological Laboratory in Miami, FL intend to acquire a full-service vendor capable of independently collecting samples NOAA's Atlantic Ocean Acidification Test-Bed (AOAT) located at Cheeca Rocks, offshore of Lower Matecumbe Key, Florida. Vendor must deliver the samples to AOML on a monthly basis, assist in Annual MAP CO2 buoy refurbishment and provide support for quarterly field trips required of the AOAT program. All work must be conducted according to applicable standards.<br />Period of performance: Base year and 4 options. In December of 2011, NOAA deployed a &lsquo;MApCO2' buoy and established an Atlantic Ocean Acidification Test-bed (AOAT) site at Cheeca Rocks, Florida. The Cheeca Rocks buoy is part of the Atlantic Ocean Acidification Test Bed, funded by NOAA's Coral Reef Conservation Program. The Florida AOAT includes studies of coral community productivity and calcification rates, along with coral growth and bioerosion rates, and tests advanced technologies for monitoring seawater carbonate chemistry, ocean acidification, and the associated impacts to coral reef ecosystems. Understanding how coral reef communities interact with the surrounding chemical environment is critical towards improving understanding of how ocean acidification unfolds within local ecosystems. The Eastern Region Acquisition Division (ERAD) requires that all contractors doing business with the Acquisition Office must be registered with the Systems for Award Management (SAM). No award can be made unless the vendor is registered in SAM. For additional information and to register in please access the following website: http://www.sam.gov/.

THE FOLLOWING PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES ARE APPLICABLE AND ARE HEREBY INCORPORATED INTO THE SOLICITATION BY REFERENCE AND BY FULL TEXT. THE FULL TEXT OF THE CLAUSES/PROVISIONS FROM THE FAR AND DFARS CAN BE ACCESSED VIA THE INTERNET USING THE FOLLOWING WEB-SITE ADDRESS: 

www.arnet.gov or http://farsite.hill.af.mil

It is the responsibility of the interested contractors to obtain copies of the necessary provisions and or clauses that are required as a part of this solicitation. Required clauses/provisions that are not submitted may render a quote not to be accepted by the Government. 



The following Clauses are applicable:

FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items; NOTE: This provision must be reviewed completely.
 It contains the guidelines for submission of your quotation.

FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation of Commercial Items; 

(a)  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Quoting Contractor  whose quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers.
    (i)  TECHNICAL CAPABILITY TO PERFORM SERVICE TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT
    (ii)  PAST PERFORMANCE
   (iii)  PRICE

Quotes will be evaluated first under Factor (i) above, which represents MINIMUM acceptable criteria.  Under this factor, quotes will be determined to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable.
  Failure to meet the minimum criteria for this factor will render the quote technically unacceptable and not be considered for award.  See paragraph (b) below.

Only those quotes which meet the minimum requirements established by Factor (i) will be further evaluated under Factors (ii) and (iii).  In the second step of evaluating those quotes determined under Factor (i) to be TECHNICALLY ACCEPTABLE, Factor (ii), PAST PERFORMANCE, is equal to Factor (iii), PRICE.  

At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with quoting contractors.  Each initial offer should, therefore contain the quoting contractorâs best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.
   

(b)  TECHNICAL CAPABILITY TO PERFORM SERVICE TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT, Factor (i), IAW FAR 52.212-1(b)(4) âThe contractor shall provide documentation of license in the state the business operates in and compliance with all Federal, State, Local laws, regulations to ensure compliance with all EPA regulations. The contractor shall provide documentation as part of their proposal to support their compliance with licensing that shows conformance to all state and federal regulations that are applicable. 

By submitting a signed proposal under this solicitation, Quoting Contractor asserts that it is technically capable of performing the specification/statement of work and all aspects of this contract.
 The contracting officer will validate quoting contractorâs technical capability to perform by verifying that the contractor has financial resources, organization and facilities required to perform the contract. TECHNICAL CAPABILITY TO PERFORM represents MINIMUM ACCEPTABLE CRITERIA. Quoting Contractorâs technical information will be used to determine whether services proposed meet the specifications included in this solicitation.  Services quoted, as provided in Quoting Contractorâs technical information, will be evaluated and determined to be either technically acceptable or technically unacceptable.  Quotes which are determined to be technically unacceptable may not be considered further for award.
 

Technical data submitted shall be reviewed against the specifications of the individual CLINS and SOW herein. Only those quotes whose technical data demonstrates that proposed items meet the terms of the SOW shall be given a âGOâ rating. If the data is determined to be not technically acceptable a âNO GOâ rating will be assigned and no further evaluation will be conducted. 

(c)  Quoting Contractorâs PAST PERFORMANCE information submitted as required, will be used to make a determination of whether the quoting contractor has a satisfactory record of past performance.  Quoting Contractorâs should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years.
 

PAST PERFORMANCE information should be provided on the form provided below titled âOfferorâs Past Performance Data.â  Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources that may have relevant information. 

Quoting Contractorâs which lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  Any quote which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the other quotes.

The Contracting Officer will evaluate Quoting Contractorâs PAST PERFORMANCE as follows:

SATISFACTORY:  Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the quoting contractorâs past performance.

MARGINAL:  Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the quoting contractorâs past performance.

NEUTRAL:  No relevant past performance available for evaluation.
  Quoting contractor has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience.  Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor.

UNSATISFACTORY: Not capable of meeting the Governmentâs anticipated delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the quoting contractorâs past performance.

(e)  A written notice of award or acceptance of a quote, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful quoting contractor within the time for acceptance specified in the quote, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</strong></p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br /><br /><strong>Informal forum with the Ombudsman.</strong> Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br /><br /><strong>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.</strong> Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest. 

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer.  If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. 

The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<p>8. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

Contractors, contractor personnel, subcontractors, and subcontractor personnel shall be subject to the same Federal laws, regulations, standards, and VA Directives and Handbooks as VA and VA personnel regarding information and information system security.

2. ACCESS TO VA INFORMATION AND VA INFORMATION SYSTEMS

a. A contractor/subcontractor shall request logical (technical) or physical access to VA information and VA information systems for their employees, subcontractors, and affiliates only to the extent necessary to perform the services specified in the contract, agreement, or task order.

b. All contractors, subcontractors, and third-party servicers and associates working with
VA information are subject to the same investigative requirements as those of VA appointees or employees who have access to the same types of information. The level and process of background security investigations for contractors must be in accordance with VA Directive and Handbook 0710, Personnel Suitability and Security Program. The Office for Operations, Security, and Preparedness is responsible for these policies and procedures.

c. Contract personnel who require access to national security programs must have a valid security clearance. National Industrial Security Program (NISP) was established by Executive Order 12829 to ensure that cleared U.S. defense industry contract personnel safeguard the classified information in their possession while performing work on contracts, programs, bids, or research and development efforts. The Department of Veterans Affairs does not have a Memorandum of Agreement with Defense Security Service (DSS). Verification of a Security Clearance must be processed through the Special Security Officer located in the Planning and National Security Service within the Office of Operations, Security, and Preparedness.

d. Custom software development and outsourced operations must be located in the U.S. to the maximum extent practical. If such services are proposed to be performed abroad and are not disallowed by other VA policy or mandates, the contractor/subcontractor must state where all non-U.S. services are provided and detail a security plan, deemed to be acceptable by VA, specifically to address mitigation of the resulting problems of communication, control, data protection, and so forth. Location within the U.S. may be an evaluation factor.

e. The contractor or subcontractor must notify the Contracting Officer immediately when
an employee working on a VA system or with access to VA information is reassigned or leaves the contractor or subcontractor's employ. The Contracting Officer must also be notified immediately by the contractor or subcontractor prior to an unfriendly termination.
3. VA INFORMATION CUSTODIAL LANGUAGE

a. Information made available to the contractor or subcontractor by VA for the performance or administration of this contract or information developed by the contractor/subcontractor in performance or administration of the contract shall be used only for those purposes and shall not be used in any other way without the prior written agreement of the VA. This clause expressly limits the contractor/subcontractor's rights to use data as described in Rights in Data - General, FAR 52.227-14(d) (1).

b. VA information should not be co-mingled, if possible, with any other data on the contractors/subcontractor's information systems or media storage systems in order to ensure VA requirements related to data protection and media sanitization can be met. If co-mingling must be allowed to meet the requirements of the business need, the contractor must ensure that VA's information is returned to the VA or destroyed in accordance with VA's sanitization requirements. VA reserves the right to conduct on-site inspections of contractor and subcontractor IT resources to ensure data security controls, separation of data and job duties, and destruction/media sanitization procedures are in compliance with VA directive requirements.

c. Prior to termination or completion of this contract, contractor/subcontractor must not
destroy information received from VA, or gathered/created by the contractor in the course of performing this contract without prior written approval by the VA. Any data destruction done on behalf of VA by a contractor/subcontractor must be done in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) requirements as outlined in VA Directive 6300, Records and Information Management and its Handbook 6300.1 Records Management Procedures, applicable VA Records Control Schedules, and VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization. Self-certification by the contractor that the data destruction requirements above have been met must be sent to the VA Contracting Officer within 30 days of termination of the contract.

d. The contractor/subcontractor must receive, gather, store, back up, maintain, use, disclose and dispose of VA information only in compliance with the terms of the contract and applicable Federal and VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies. If Federal or VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies become applicable to the VA information or information systems after execution of the contract, or if NIST issues or updates applicable FIPS or Special Publications (SP) after execution of this contract, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to implement the information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies in this contract.

e. The contractor/subcontractor shall not make copies of VA information except as
authorized and necessary to perform the terms of the agreement or to preserve electronic information stored on contractor/subcontractor electronic storage media for restoration in case any electronic equipment or data used by the contractor/subcontractor needs to be restored to an operating state. If copies are made for restoration purposes, after the restoration is complete, the copies must be appropriately destroyed.

f. If VA determines that the contractor has violated any of the information confidentiality,
privacy, and security provisions of the contract, it shall be sufficient grounds for VA to withhold payment to the contractor or third party or terminate the contract for default or terminate for cause under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12.

g. If a VHA contract is terminated for cause, the associated BAA must also be terminated and appropriate actions taken in accordance with VHA Handbook 1600.01, Business Associate Agreements. Absent an agreement to use or disclose protected health information, there is no business associate relationship.

h. The contractor/subcontractor must store, transport, or transmit VA sensitive information in an encrypted form, using VA-approved encryption tools that are, at a minimum, FIPS 140-2 validated.

i. The contractor/subcontractor's firewall and Web services security controls, if applicable, shall meet or exceed VA's minimum requirements. VA Configuration Guidelines are available upon request.

j. Except for uses and disclosures of VA information authorized by this contract for performance of the contract, the contractor/subcontractor may use and disclose VA information only in two other situations: (i) in response to a qualifying order of a court of competent jurisdiction, or (ii) with VA's prior written approval. The contractor/subcontractor must refer all requests for, demands for production of, or inquiries about, VA information and information systems to the VA contracting officer for response.

k. Notwithstanding the provision above, the contractor/subcontractor shall not release VA records protected by Title 38 U.S.C. 5705, confidentiality of medical quality assurance records and/or Title 38 U.S.C. 7332, confidentiality of certain health records pertaining to drug addiction, sickle cell anemia, alcoholism or alcohol abuse, or infection with human immunodeficiency virus. If the contractor/subcontractor is in receipt of a court order or other requests for the above mentioned information, that contractor/subcontractor shall immediately refer such court orders or other requests to the VA contracting officer for response.

l. For service that involves the storage, generating, transmitting, or exchanging of VA sensitive information but does not require C&A or an MOU-ISA for system interconnection, the contractor/subcontractor must complete a Contractor Security Control Assessment (CSCA) on a yearly basis and provide it to the COTR.

4. SECURITY INCIDENT INVESTIGATION

a. The term "security incident" means an event that has, or could have, resulted in unauthorized access to, loss or damage to VA assets, or sensitive information, or an action that breaches VA security procedures. The contractor/subcontractor shall immediately notify the COTR and simultaneously, the designated ISO and Privacy Officer for the contract of any known or suspected security/privacy incidents, or any unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, including that contained in system(s) to which the contractor/subcontractor has access.

b. To the extent known by the contractor/subcontractor, the contractor/subcontractor's notice to VA shall identify the information involved, the circumstances surrounding the incident (including to whom, how, when, and where the VA information or assets were placed at risk or compromised), and any other information that the contractor/subcontractor considers relevant.

c. With respect to unsecured protected health information, the business associate is deemed to have discovered a data breach when the business associate knew or should have known of a breach of such information. Upon discovery, the business associate must notify the covered entity of the breach. Notifications need to be made in accordance with the executed business associate agreement.

d. In instances of theft or break-in or other criminal activity, the contractor/subcontractor must concurrently report the incident to the appropriate law enforcement entity (or entities) of jurisdiction, including the VA OIG and Security and Law Enforcement. The contractor, its employees, and its subcontractors and their employees shall cooperate with VA and any law enforcement authority responsible for the investigation and prosecution of any possible criminal law violation(s) associated with any incident. The contractor/subcontractor shall cooperate with VA in any civil litigation to recover VA information, obtain monetary or other compensation from a third party for damages arising from any incident, or obtain injunctive relief against any third party arising from, or related to, the incident.

5. LIQUIDATED DAMAGES FOR DATA BREACH

a. Consistent with the requirements of 38 U.S.C. Â§5725, a contract may require access to sensitive personal information. If so, the contractor is liable to VA for liquidated damages in the event of a data breach or privacy incident involving any SPI the contractor/subcontractor processes or maintains under this contract.

b. The contractor/subcontractor shall provide notice to VA of a "security incident" as set forth in the Security Incident Investigation section above. Upon such notification, VA must secure from a non-Department entity or the VA Office of Inspector General an independent risk analysis of the data breach to determine the level of risk associated with the data breach for the potential misuse of any sensitive personal information involved in the data breach. The term 'data breach' means the loss, theft, or other unauthorized access, or any access other than that incidental to the scope of employment, to data containing sensitive personal information, in electronic or printed form, that results in the potential compromise of the confidentiality or integrity of the data. Contractor shall fully cooperate with the entity performing the risk analysis. Failure to cooperate may be deemed a material breach and grounds for contract termination.

c. Each risk analysis shall address all relevant information concerning the data breach, including the following:

(1) Nature of the event (loss, theft, unauthorized access);

(2) Description of the event, including:

(a) date of occurrence;

(b) data elements involved, including any PII, such as full name, social security number, date of birth, home address, account number, disability code;

(3) Number of individuals affected or potentially affected;

(4) Names of individuals or groups affected or potentially affected;

(5) Ease of logical data access to the lost, stolen or improperly accessed data in light of the degree of protection for the data, e.g., unencrypted, plain text;

(6) Amount of time the data has been out of VA control;

(7) The likelihood that the sensitive personal information will or has been compromised (made accessible to and usable by unauthorized persons);

(8) Known misuses of data containing sensitive personal information, if any;

(9) Assessment of the potential harm to the affected individuals;

(10) Data breach analysis as outlined in 6500.2 Handbook, Management of Security and Privacy Incidents, as appropriate; and

(11) Whether credit protection services may assist record subjects in avoiding or mitigating the results of identity theft based on the sensitive personal information that may have been compromised.

d. Based on the determinations of the independent risk analysis, the contractor shall be responsible for paying to the VA liquidated damages in the amount of $37.50 per affected individual to cover the cost of providing credit protection services to affected individuals consisting of the following:

(1) Notification;

(2) One year of credit monitoring services consisting of automatic daily monitoring of at least 3 relevant credit bureau reports;

(3) Data breach analysis;

(4) Fraud resolution services, including writing dispute letters, initiating fraud alerts and credit freezes, to assist affected individuals to bring matters to resolution;

(5) One year of identity theft insurance with $20,000.00 coverage at $0 deductible; and

(6) Necessary legal expenses the subjects may incur to repair falsified or damaged credit records, histories, or financial affairs.

6. SECURITY CONTROLS COMPLIANCE TESTING

On a periodic basis, VA, including the Office of Inspector General, reserves the right to evaluate any or all of the security controls and privacy practices implemented by the contractor under the clauses contained within the contract. With 10 working-day's notice, at the request of the government, the contractor must fully cooperate and assist in a government-sponsored security controls assessment at each location wherein VA information is processed or stored, or information systems are developed, operated, maintained, or used on behalf of VA, including those initiated by the Office of Inspector General. The government may conduct a security control assessment on shorter notice (to include unannounced assessments) as determined by VA in the event of a security incident or at any other time.

7. TRAINING

a. All contractor employees and subcontractor employees requiring access to VA information and VA information systems shall complete the following before being granted access to VA information and its systems:

(1) Sign and acknowledge (either manually or electronically) understanding of and responsibilities for compliance with the Contractor Rules of Behavior, Appendix E relating to access to VA information and information systems;

(2) Successfully complete the VA Cyber Security Awareness and Rules of Behavior training and annually complete required security training;

(3) Successfully complete the appropriate VA privacy training and annually complete required privacy training; and 

(4) Successfully complete any additional cyber security or privacy training, as required for VA personnel with equivalent information system access [to be defined by the VA program official and provided to the contracting officer for inclusion in the solicitation document - e.g., any role-based information security training required in accordance with NIST Special Publication 800-16, Information Technology Security Training Requirements.]

b. The contractor shall provide to the contracting officer and/or the COR a copy of the training certificates and certification of signing the Contractor Rules of Behavior for each applicable employee within 1 week of the initiation of the contract and annually thereafter, as required.

c. Failure to complete the mandatory annual training and sign the Rules of Behavior annually, within the timeframe required, is grounds for suspension or termination of all physical or electronic access privileges and removal from work on the contract until such time as the training and documents are complete

852.203-70 COMMERCIAL ADVERTISING
The bidder or offeror agrees that if a contract is awarded to him/her, as a result of this solicitation, he/she will not advertise the award of the contract in his/her commercial advertising in such a manner as to state or imply that the Department of Veterans Affairs endorses a product, project or commercial line of endeavor.

(End of Clause)

852.211-70 SERVICE DATA MANUALS
(a) The successful bidder will supply operation/maintenance (service data) manuals with each piece of equipment in the quantity specified in the solicitation and resulting purchase order. As a minimum, the manual(s) shall be bound and equivalent to the manual(s) provided the manufacturer's designated field service representative as well as comply with all the requirements in paragraphs (b) through (i) of this clause. Sections, headings and section sequence identified in (b) through (i) of this clause are typical and may vary between manufacturers. Variances in the sections, headings and section sequence, however, do not relieve the manufacturer of his/her responsibility in supplying the technical data called for therein.

(b) Title Page and Front Matter. The title page shall include the equipment nomenclature, model number, effective date of the manual and the manufacturer's name and address. If the manual applies to a particular version of the equipment only, the title page shall also list that equipment's serial number. Front matter shall consist of the Table of Contents, List of Tables, List of Illustrations and a frontispiece (photograph or line drawing) depicting the equipment.

(c) Section I, General Description. This section shall provide a generalized description of the equipment or devices and shall describe its purpose or intended use. Included in this section will be a table listing all pertinent equipment specifications, power requirements, environmental limitations and physical dimensions.

(d) Section II, Installation. Section II shall provide pertinent installation information. It shall list all input and output connectors using applicable reference designators and functional names as they appear on the equipment. Included in this listing will be a brief description of the function of each connector along with the connector type. Instructions shall be provided as to the recommended method of repacking the equipment for shipment (packing material, labeling, etc.).

(e) Section III, Operation. Section III will fully describe the operation of the equipment and shall include a listing of each control with a brief description of its function and step-by-step procedures for each operating mode. Procedures will use the control(s) nomenclature as it appears on the equipment and will be keyed to one or more illustrations of the equipment. Operating procedures will include any preoperational checks, calibration adjustments and operation tests. Notes, cautions and warnings shall be set off from the text body so they may easily be recognizable and will draw the attention of the reader. Illustrations should be used wherever possible depicting equipment connections for test, calibration, patient monitoring and measurements. For large, complex and/or highly versatile equipment capable of many operating modes and in other instances where the Operation Section is quite large, operational information may be bound separately in the form of an Operators Manual. The providing of a separate Operators manual does not relieve the supplier of his responsibility for providing the minimum acceptable maintenance data specified herein. When applicable, flow charts and narrative descriptions of software shall be provided. If programming is either built-in and/or user modifiable, a complete software listing shall be supplied. Equipment items with software packages shall also include diagnostic routines and sample outputs. Submission information shall be given in the Maintenance Section to identify equipment malfunctions that are software related.

(f) Section IV, Principles of Operation. This section shall describe in narrative form the principles of operation of the equipment. Circuitry shall be discussed in sufficient detail to be understood by technicians and engineers who possess a working knowledge of electronics and a general familiarity with the overall application of the devices. The circuit descriptions should start at the overall equipment level and proceed to more detailed circuit descriptions. The overall description shall be keyed to a functional block diagram of the equipment. Circuit descriptions shall be keyed to schematic diagrams discussed in paragraph (i) below. It is recommended that for complex or special circuits, simplified schematics should be included in this section.

(g) Section V, Maintenance. The maintenance section shall contain a list of recommended test equipment, special tools, preventive maintenance instructions and corrective information. The list of test equipment shall be that recommended by the manufacturer and shall be designated by manufacturer and model number. Special tools are those items not commercially available or those that are designed specifically for the equipment being supplied. Sufficient data will be provided to enable their purchase by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Preventive maintenance instructions shall consist of those recommended by the manufacturer to preclude unnecessary failures. Procedures and the recommended frequency of performance shall be included for visual inspection, cleaning, lubricating, mechanical adjustments and circuit calibration. Corrective maintenance shall consist of the data necessary to troubleshoot and rectify a problem and shall include procedures for realigning and testing the equipment. Troubleshooting shall include either a list of test points with the applicable voltage levels or waveforms that would be present under a certain prescribed set of conditions, a troubleshooting chart listing the symptom, probable cause and remedy, or a narrative containing sufficient data to enable a test technician or electronics engineer to determine and locate the probable cause of malfunction. Data shall also be provided describing the preferred method of repairing or replacing discrete components mounted on printed circuit boards or located in areas where special steps must be followed to disassemble the equipment. Procedures shall be included to realign and test the equipment at the completion of repairs and to restore it to its original operating condition. These procedures shall be supported by the necessary waveforms and voltage levels, and data for selecting matched components. Diagrams, either photographic or line, shall show the location of printed circuit board mounted components.

(h) Section VI, Replacement Parts List. The replacement parts list shall list, in alphanumeric order, all electrical/electronic, mechanical and pneumatic components, their description, value and tolerance, true manufacturer and manufacturers' part number.

(i) Section VII, Drawings. Wiring and schematic diagrams shall be included. The drawings will depict the circuitry using standard symbols and shall include the reference designations and component values or type designators. Drawings shall be clear and legible and shall not be engineering or productions sketches.

SECTION C - CONTRACT CLAUSES

C.1  FSS RFQ INTRODUCTORY LANGUAGE
  The terms and conditions of the contractor's FSS contract (including any contract modifications) apply to all Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) and task or delivery orders issued under the contract as a result of this RFQ.  When a lower price has been established, or when the delivery terms, FOB terms, or ordering requirements have been modified by the BPA or task/delivery order, those modified terms will apply to all purchases made pursuant to it and take precedence over the FSS contract.  Any unique terms and conditions of a BPA or order issued under the contract that are not a part of the applicable FSS contract will govern.  In the event of an inconsistency between the terms and conditions of a BPA or task/delivery order and the Contractor's FSS terms, other than those identified above, the terms of the FSS contract will take precedence.
C.2  VAAR 852.203-70 COMMERCIAL ADVERTISING (JAN 2008)
  The bidder or offeror agrees that if a contract is awarded to him/her, as a result of this solicitation, he/she will not advertise the award of the contract in his/her commercial advertising in such a manner as to state or imply that the Department of Veterans Affairs endorses a product, project or commercial line of endeavor.
(End of Clause)
C.3  VAAR 852.211-73  BRAND NAME OR EQUAL (JAN 2008)
  (Note: as used in this clause, the term "brand name" includes identification of products by make and model.)
  (a) If items called for by this invitation for bids have been identified in the schedule by a "brand name or equal" description, such identification is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive, and is to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that will be satisfactory. Bids offering "equal" products (including products of the brand name manufacturer other than the one described by brand name) will be considered for award if such products are clearly identified in the bids and are determined by the Government to meet fully the salient characteristics requirements listed in the invitation.
  (b) Unless the bidder clearly indicates in the bid that the bidder is offering an "equal" product, the bid shall be considered as offering a brand name product referenced in the invitation for bids.
  (c)(1) If the bidder proposes to furnish an "equal" product, the brand name, if any, of the product to be furnished shall be inserted in the space provided in the invitation for bids, or such product shall be otherwise clearly identified in the bid. The evaluation of bids and the determination as to equality of the product offered shall be the responsibility of the Government and will be based on information furnished by the bidder or identified in his/her bid as well as other information reasonably available to the purchasing activity. CAUTION TO BIDDERS. The purchasing activity is not responsible for locating or securing any information that is not identified in the bid and reasonably available to the purchasing activity. Accordingly, to insure that sufficient information is available, the bidder must furnish as a part of his/her bid all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings or other information) necessary for the purchasing activity to:
      (i) Determine whether the product offered meets the salient characteristics requirement of the Invitation for Bids, and
      (ii) Establish exactly what the bidder proposes to furnish and what the Government would be binding itself to purchase by making an award. The information furnished may include specific references to information previously furnished or to information otherwise available to the purchasing activity.
    (2) If the bidder proposes to modify a product so as to make it conform to the requirements of the Invitation for Bids, he/she shall:
      (i) Include in his/her bid a clear description of such proposed modifications, and
      (ii) Clearly mark any descriptive material to show the proposed modifications.

<DESC><p><strong>AMENDMENT #1: This amendment is to extend the electronic proposal submission response deadline to no later than 2:00 P.M.&nbsp; EST on Monday, April 7, 2014.</strong><br /><br />***************************************************<br /><br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is being issued as Request for Quotations (RFQ) NIHLM2014039SRE. The resultant order will be a firm-fixed price purchase order.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Library of Medicine (NLM) intends to procure professional services to develop and maintain a Health Literacy Tool Shed educational and outreach website to create a unique resource center to support health literacy researchers and enhance the quality of national and international health literacy research. This acquisition is Full and Open. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541990-All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>Health literacy has become a well-established area of study. The National Library of Medicine (NLM) has a health literacy working group that coordinates NLM's work with similar working groups administered by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). The National Network of Libraries of Medicine (NN/LM) also has an active health literacy interest group among its membership.</p>
<p>The Health Literacy Tool Shed, a one-stop (Internet-based) location, will create an arena where researchers can obtain many of the quantitative tools needed to conduct and improve the methodological quality of health literacy research. The Health Literacy Tool Shed represents a service that provides outreach to health literacy professionals. For the first time, researchers and practitioners will be able to find many of the available constructs and quantitative tools used to measure health literacy in clinical, public health, and health campaign intervention research. Although the project's beneficiaries are health literacy researchers and practitioners, the project is designed to create a needed educational resource.</p>
<p>The Health Literacy Tool Shed will organize constructs, measures, and instruments that are currently scattered across an array of health literacy research. There is no current resource where practitioners and researchers can consult what health literacy measurement measures, constructs, and instruments are best suited to a planned project. Since there is no repository for researchers, clinicians, and practitioners to retrieve detailed information on health literacy assessment instruments, this foundational gap inhibits the field's development as a coherent body of knowledge and practice. The end of methodological fragmentation in the health literacy field (and the availability of a website to find the best instruments for specific projects) also will assist NLM's future health literacy research and help make NLM a leader in health literacy research and practice.</p>
<p>The Health Literacy Tool Shed will be a unique educational resource. While this type of resource often is touted by health literacy researchers and practitioners, currently the proposed educational resource does not exist nor is a similar resource under construction elsewhere.</p>
<p>Purpose/Objective</p>
<p>This Health Literacy Tool Shed educational and outreach project creates a unique resource center to support health literacy researchers and enhance the quality of national and international health literacy research. While the project's beneficiaries are health literacy researchers and practitioners, the current project creates an educational resource that provides outreach to a research community as well as a topic of interest to the NLM.</p>
<p>The project will create a one-stop website, where researchers can assess many of the quantitative tools needed to conduct and improve health literacy research. The proposed Health Literacy Tool Shed educational resource will provide a vital outreach service for the health literacy research community. For the first time, researchers and practitioners will be able to identify and assess many of the available constructs and quantitative measures used to assess health literacy in clinical, public health, and health campaign intervention research in one, accessible location.</p>
<p>Although dozens of health literacy measurement tools have been introduced and the literature has proliferated, a core problem in health literacy outreach and intervention efforts is the uneven quality of methods used by health literacy assessment teams and a confusing array of constructs, measures, and instruments. Some examples of the current methodological confusion and fragmentation in health literacy research is found in Appendix A, which suggests there are at least fifteen (15) separate measures based on the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy. Appendix A also notes there are nine different measures based in the Test of Functional Health Literacy (TOFHLA) as well as many other constructs and measures of aspects of health literacy.</p>
<p>Despite the widespread availability of health literacy measurement tools, criticisms from independent reviewers reflect that health literacy research methodological flaws may stem from a lack of infrastructure to support health literacy researchers and practitioners. Since there is no repository for researchers, clinicians, and practitioners to retrieve detailed information about health literacy assessment constructs, measures, and instruments, the gap impedes the health literacy field's development into a more coherent body of knowledge and practice. <br /><br />The Health Literacy Tool Shed educational resource will create for the first time: 1) access to health literacy assessment tools; 2) a health literacy tool selection process for investigators; 3) an overview of researcher adherence to various health literacy instruments; and, 4) background information about a construct/measure's validity or empirical validation.</p>
<p>The Health Literacy Tool Shed will be a virtual indexing system for health literacy methods with specific information on the following:</p>
<p>&#9679;Administration instructions (how long it takes to administer, number of questions, languages, method of administration, etc.)</p>
<p>&#9679;Constructs measured (i.e. numeracy, word pronunciation, problem solving, general health maintenance, etc.)</p>
<p>&#9679;Links to the instruments (or information on how to obtain the instrument when the Contractor has not secured permission to post the instrument) and to validation articles</p>
<p>&#9679;Expert commentary on strengths and limitations and on how to select instruments in various research and practice contexts.</p>
<p>The Health Literacy Tool Shed also could identify some gaps in the current array of health literacy instruments and provide a venue for users to discuss the development of further health literacy research assessment tools. In addition, the Health Literacy Tool Shed provides an excellent complement to NLM's Consumer Health Informatics Research Resource (chirr.nlm.nih.gov), which provides general information about common constructs used in consumer health informatics assessment, including health literacy.</p>
<p>Mandatory Criteria</p>
<p>1)The Contractor must possess extensive academic knowledge and expertise in the field of health literacy research and extensive experience in health literacy practice in both health care delivery and public health.<br />2)The Contractor must display a track record of national and international leadership in evaluating health literacy research.<br />3)The Contractor's subject matter experts (health literacy researchers and practitioners) must possess a Ph.D. or M.D. degree and publish regularly in a refereed academic journal.</p>

STATISTICAL REPORTING (PPIRS-SR) IN PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (1)   The offeror?s past performance shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 13.106-2 or 15.305(a)(2), as applicable.  This procurement is subject to Past Performance Information Retrieval System ? Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR), authorized by the Department of Defense for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services.  
(2)   The purpose of the PPIRS-SR is to provide contracting personnel with quantifiable past performance information regarding delivery and quality, as collected from existing DoD reporting systems.  PPIRS-SR uses the past performance data collected to classify each supplier?s performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s).
(3)   Quality:  The method used in PPIRS-SR to classify the quality of a supplier?s past performance is a comparison of quality records among all suppliers who have provided goods or services to the Federal Government which are categorized in the same Federal Supply Class or Service Class (FSC).  Based on the comparison among suppliers in a specific FSC group, suppliers are classified by PPIRS-SR into a color rating that represents the supplier?s overall quality performance for that specific Federal Supply Class or Service Class.  The following is a summarization of the PPIRS-SR classification colors:
1.  Dark Blue:Top 5% of suppliers in FSC group* 2.  Purple:Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group* 3.  Green:Next 70% of suppliers in FSC group* 4.  Yellow:Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group* 5.  Red:Bottom 5% of suppliers in FSC group*
* If all supplier performance ratings for an entire FSC group are equal, all suppliers in that group will be classified Green.
(4)   Delivery:  Supplier delivery past performance is classified in PPIRS-SR by the supplier?s percentage of on time deliveries.  On time deliveries are calculated using the number of line items delivered and a weighting factor which reflects the length of time a delivery was overdue.
(5)   PPIRS-SR classifications are established monthly for each supplier and can be reviewed at http://www.ppirs.gov/.  Suppliers are granted access to PPIRS-SR for their own classifications.  Offerors are encouraged to review their own classifications as well as the PPIRS-SR reporting procedures and methodology detailed in the PPIRS-SR Procedures Manual and the PPIRS-SR User Guide available at http://www.ppirs.gov.  The method to challenge a rating is also found on the identified website.
(6)   Suppliers with no history in PPIRS-SR will be considered to have a neutral PPIRS-SR rating. <BR> <BR>Due to the interrelationship of supplies and/or services to be provided hereunder, the Government reserves the right to make a single award to the offeror whose offer is considered in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered.  Therefore, offerors proposing less than the entire effort specified herein may be determined to be unacceptable. <BR> <BR>1)   Award under this procurement will be made to the technically acceptable quote/offer which is most advantageous to the Government, price and past performance considered.
2)   Technically Acceptable - In order to be determined technically acceptable, offers must meet or exceed the specifications, delivery requirements, and other terms and conditions in the solicitation and any subsequent amendments.  If applicable, offers must also meet the requirements of FAR 52.211-6 Brand Name or Equal.   The offer must be determined to be technically acceptable before further consideration.
3)   Price - Evaluation of price will include the following:
(  )Single Award evaluation per the paragraph entitled "Single Award for All Items". (  )Split Award evaluation per the paragraph entitled ?Evaluation of Offers for Split Awards?. (  )Transportation costs per FAR 52.247-__@@___. (  )Evaluation of Options per FAR 52.217-__@@__.
4)   Past Performance - Evaluation of past performance will be based on information obtained from PPIRS-SR as well as any other sources which may have relevant information.  A quote/offer with a low PPIRS-SR rating (red or yellow for quality and/or less than a 70 weighted delivery score) may not represent the most advantageous quote/offer to the Government. <BR> <BR>(a) Definitions.

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Authority. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) (APR 2010) (a) ___________ is hereby designated as the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). The COR may be changed at any time by the Government without prior notice to the contractor by a unilateral modification to the contract. The COR is located at: ____________________ ____________________ ____________________ Phone Number:____________________ E-mail:____________________ (b) The responsibilities and limitations of the COR are as follows: (1) The COR is responsible for the technical aspects of the contract and serves as technical liaison with the contractor. The COR is also responsible for the final inspection and acceptance of all deliverables and such other responsibilities as may be specified in the contract. (2) The COR is not authorized to make any commitments or otherwise obligate the Government or authorize any changes which affect the contract price, terms or conditions. Any contractor request for changes shall be referred to the Contracting Officer directly or through the COR. No such changes shall be made without the express written prior authorization of the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer may designate assistant or alternate COR(s) to act for the COR by naming such assistant/alternate(s) in writing and transmitting a copy of such designation to the contractor. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1313.106?2?70, insert the following provision: Evaluation Utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures (Date) All solicitations using simplified acquisition procedures in FAR Part 13 must include provision 1352.213?70, Evaluation Utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures, or similar language setting out evaluation criteria.The Government will issue an order resulting from this request for quotation to the responsible offeror whose quotation results in the best value to the Government, considering both price and non-price factors. <BR> <BR>Insert provision 1352.213?71, Instructions for Submitting Quotations under the Simplified Acquisition Threshold?Non-Commercial, or similar language in all solicitations for non-commercial purchase orders under the simplified acquisition threshold.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).<br /><br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.<br /><br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br /><br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.<br /><br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

(End of clause) <BR> <BR>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:  Department of Homeland Security United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 Washington, D.

<DESC><p>Radioactive iodine, mainly the isotope Iodine-131, is used in the diagnosis and treatment of several medical conditions, the primary ones in the present context being treatment of hyperthyroidism and thyroid cancer following thyroidectomy. The importance of these conditions arises from the fact that their treatment protocols generally call for administration of relatively large doses of Iodine-131, and such patients therefore pose the greatest potential for exposure of others.</p>
<p>Patients are often released from the hospital following treatment if they meet the release conditions specified in the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's (NRC) Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 10, Part 35.75, "Release of individuals containing unsealed byproduct material or implants containing byproduct material." The basic criterion underlying the release conditions is that "the total effective dose equivalent to any other individual from exposure to the released individual is not likely to exceed 5 mSv (0.5 rem)."</p>
<p>To assist licensees in implementing the above release requirement, NRC published Regulatory Guide 8.39, "Release of patients administered radioactive materials." This guide provides formulas and tables that are considered acceptable to NRC in translating the basic 5 mSv requirement into operational quantities to be used in releasing patients. For example, an operational quantity used in releasing patients is the dose rate measured at a specified distance from the patient. The formulas and tables in the guide use very conservative assumptions in estimating the dose to an individual that results from exposure to the released patient, but the guide also permits licensees to base their calculations on patient-specific conditions, which are often much less conservative than the generic conditions.</p>
<p>There have been a number of publications in the technical, peer-reviewed literature describing studies that attempted to measure or estimate the doses received by persons coming in contact with released patients, and a preliminary review of some of these publications suggested that the release condition of 5 mSv noted above is being met in practice. However, the NRC Commission has decided that a more extensive review of available data, and a re-examination of the calculation methods and tables described in Regulatory Guide 8.39, shall be conducted to ensure that exposures to members of the public resulting from release of patients according to 10 CFR 35.75 do in fact meet the release criterion, and that the methods used to calculate operational release criteria are reasonably accurate and not excessively conservative. In addition, the Commission instructed staff to generate additional data on exposure of members of the public if the available data is considered to be insufficient to provide reasonable assurance that the release criterion is being met in practice. The objective of tasks under this upcoming solicitation are to undertake, through contracts, to carry out the Commission's directions.</p>
<p>To supplement data found in the available literature on typical exposures to members of the public that are expected to come in proximity of released patients who were treated with high activities of Iodine-131 for hyperthyroidism and thyroid cancer. Exposed persons include personnel at the hotels and nursing homes where patients sometimes stay immediately following their release from the hospital. Measurements made under this task, however, shall only include nursing home and hotel staff. The study shall include collection of data on both external and internal doses, and may involve measurement of doses using personnel dosimetry for external exposures and some form of bioassay for internal exposures.</p>
<p>The resulting contract is expected to be a cost-plus-fixed fee contract. The expected period of performance is 16 months, with an option to extend to 24 months.</p>
<p>This procurement is expected to be awarded in Fiscal Year 2014.</p>

Each task order will list the specific activity items.<br />The guaranteed minimum amount for each awarded contract, inclusive of the base and all option periods, will be $2,500. The combined value of the contract for all awards shall not exceed $500,000 over the base period and four option years.<br />All work sites will be located within the administrative boundaries of the Chattahoochee-Oconee National Forest.<br />OTHER INFORMATION: A pre-bid conference is scheduled for March 26, 2014 at&nbsp;10:30am at the Forest Service office in Gainesville GA.

<p><strong>SPECIALIZED SERVICES:</strong></p>
<p>In the course of doing business with Architect/Engineering firms under contract with the Denver Service Center, the NPS occasionally needs to obtain specialized services from subconsultants under the prime contract. In these instances, the majority of the work may be performed solely by the subconsultant with little involvement of the prime contractor. Even though the work is performed primarily by the subconsultant, NPS will ensure that the prime contractor is involved in all discussions and all correspondence is routed through the prime contractor. All task orders will be issued to the prime contractor. Prime contractors have indicated their concerns with the ceiling amounts and the effect these "pass-throughs" would have on the cap. This has been taken into consideration in establishing the maximum contract amount for this solicitation and the resultant contract(s). Prime contractors submitting statements of qualifications are advised that the NPS will continue to acquire such specialized services in this manner. The NPS does not allow the prime consultant an administrative handling or coordination fee on sub-consultant's services.</p>

<p><strong>SUSTAINABLE DESIGN:</strong></p>
<p>The U.S. Government has adopted sustainable design as the guiding principle (http://www.energystar.gov/ia/business/Guiding_Principles.pdf) for its planning, design and construction projects. By definition, this means meeting present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. In practice, sustainable design utilizes best available solutions within the design tradition and conserves global resources, utilizes energy efficiently, recycles materials and waste, and specifies ecologically responsible methods, practices, and materials in the construction and operations of Government facilities. Accordingly, the selected firm(s) must exhibit current credentials and demonstrated competency in sustainable design and certifications and memberships in professionally recognized organizations that promulgate sustainable practices. Firms shall validate their sustainable design abilities and practices through completed LEED certified construction projects and green building awards. LEED accredited professionals should play leading roles on the project team.</p>
<p>Sustainability related executive orders, laws, regulations, best practices, and some recommended products may be found at: http://www.nps.gov/dscw/ds-sustainability.htm</p>
<p><strong>UNIVERSAL DESIGN AND ACCESSIBILITY:</strong></p>
<p>The National Pak Service is dedicated to making projects universally designed and seamlessly accessible to visitors and staff with disabilities. All planning, design and construction projects shall meet and exceed the requirements of the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards (ABAAS), Section 504 (program access) and Section 508 (electronic and information technology access) of the Rehabilitation Act. The 2006 NPS Management Policies requires that projects exceed these federal requirements and apply the tenets of universal design to provide usable and inclusive experiences for all. To meet the requirements of Executive Order 13548, "Increasing Federal Employment of Individuals with Disabilities", NPA assures visitor use areas and employee areas are accessible and provide the connectivity to all amenities so that employees with disabilities can fully participate in all programs.</p>

The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to issue a competitive solicitation for AEGIS Combat System (ACS) Ship Integration and Test (SI&T) efforts. The anticipated requirements include SI&T engineering and technical efforts required to deliver fully integrated combat systems in support of future DDG 51 class new construction ships, fleet modernization programs for in-service DDG 51 and CG 47 class AEGIS ships, and BMD capability upgrades beginning in FY14. AEGIS SI&T represents the management of the physical design, installation, test, and maintenance from concept development throughout a shipâs lifecycle of warfare systems to build and maintain combat ready ships.
 These efforts are focused on the interface and ship design, equipment installation and planning, industrial level testing, and at-sea qualification of the combat system during construction, extended availabilities, and sea trials. Post-delivery SI&T support for DDGs 117 and 118, new construction SI&T for Advanced Capability Build (ACB) 16/Technology Insertion (TI) 16 ships, and ACB 16/TI 16 modernization ships will be included in this procurement.

<DESC>At this time a draft solicitation is attached for industry questions and comments. The government will be accepting questions through 5 PM EST on 18 January 2013. All questions should be electronically submitted to Ms. Jennifer L. Thompson (jennifer.l.thompson1@navy.mil) and Mr. Brendan OâMara (brendan.oâmara@navy.mil). Only questions transmitted electronically will receive a response. It is the Governmentâs intention that questions and responses will be distributed electronically to all Offerors. Information provided with each question should include the document name, document date, specific page, paragraph, clause or other definitive citation requiring clarification. Questions will be answered and may be incorporated into the final Request for Proposal (RFP) at the discretion of the Navy.

Questions received after the date set forth above may not be answered prior to the release of the final RFP.
 Offerors are hereby notified that from time to time, the Government may post additional information to the web site relating to this solicitation (e.g. responses to questions). It is the Offerors responsibility to check the web site for any such information.

Access to classified and other restricted information being made available as attachment(s) to this solicitation can be obtained at https://viewnet.nswcdd.navy.mil.  Connection instructions are contained in Attachment J-28.  Offerors who are unable to access the information on VIEWNET should submit a written request to the Contracting Officer Mr. Brendan OâMara at brendan.oâmara@navy.mil or the Contract Specialist Jennifer L.

  The written request must include data on the company facility and specific individual(s) requiring access as follows: facility security clearance level, issuing Government agency, and expiration date; facility security office phone/fax numbers; facility storage level, cage code, and complete destination addressâ personnel for whom access to classified data is requested to include full name; security clearance level, issuing Government agency, and expiration date; date of birth; and city/state of birth. Once a prospective Offerorâs âneed-to-knowâ and security clearance is verified, classified attachments will be provided.  For all Offerors seeking access to these materials through VIEWNET or via the Contract Specialist, âneed-to-knowâ shall only apply to those Offerors who can demonstrate that they meet the security requirements of this solicitation.
  Offerors must submit the documentation specified above to the Contracting Officer or Contract Specialist, in order to receive access to these materials.  Access to these materials will be granted solely for the purpose of preparing a proposal under this solicitation, and does not establish a common âneed-to-knowâ with any other program, contract, or effort.

This pre-solicitation notice is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at https://www.neco.navy.mil. While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.
 Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command. Disclaimer: This pre-solicitation notice is for information only, and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to solicit contractual offers or award contracts. The Government is not soliciting, nor will it accept, proposals as a result of this synopsis.  If a solicitation is issued in the future, it will be announced via FEDBIZOPPS/NECO and interested parties must comply with that announcement. The Government will not reimburse respondents for any questions submitted or information provided as a result of this notice. This is not an RFP or a promise to issue an RFP and this information is subject to modification and in no way binds the Government to award a contract.

It is the Governments intent to make multiple contract awards under a single solicitation. This solicitation will result in multiple award task order contracts entered into in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 16.504(c). The Government anticipates awarding 2 or more IDIQ contracts as a result of this solicitation. The individual task orders anticipated for this contract will be in support of customers supported by SPA. This type of procurement IDIQ MATOC is expected to help minimize design effort and related overhead expenditures and handle compressed delivery schedules.

The IDIQ for Vertical Construction Work will not be used for Architectural-Engineering (AE) services; however, incidental AE services may be needed for some projects. <br /><br />This requirement will be solicited as a 8(a) set-aside pursuant to FAR Subpart 6.204 Section 8(a) competition. The resultant contracts will be Firm Fixed Price contracts. The proposed contracts feature a base year and one (1) option year. Each individual task order will establish a period of performance for the individual effort. The value of the base year will not exceed $24.5 million (M) dollars, and option year one will not exceed $24.5 M. The total shared capacity of the base contract plus all potential options shall not exceed $49 M. Interested offerors must be able to bond per task order up to $5 M and bond up to $25M aggregate.

<DESC>Washington Headquarters Services / Acquisition Directorate (WHS/AD) intends to award a follow-on sole source contract to SRA INTERNATIONAL, INC., 4300 FAIR LAKES CT, FAIRFAX VA 22033-4232; the current order number is HQ0034-09-F-3001. This contract is planned to be awarded NLT 01 May 2014 for a base of six months.<br /><br />The contract action is due to an unanticipated Life Safety Backbone (LSB) outage and will provide continued support for the Pentagon Force Protection Agency's (PFPA) Life Safety System Network (LSSN) and upgrade/repair of the Life Safety Backbone (LSB) network which provides access to the mission-critical systems needed to properly safeguard personnel and facilities across the National Capital Region (NCR). As a result of the LSB network outage PFPA, with SRA, has developed a four-phased approach:<br /><br />&bull; Phase #1 - Immediate recovery of the LSB; <br />&bull; Phase #2 - Update the existing LSB Network Core devices<br />&bull; Phase #3 - Replace existing LSB Network Core devices<br />&bull; Phase #4 - Replace existing LSB outer edge devices.<br /><br />Awarding the proposed contract to another source would result in unacceptable delays and substantial additional costs to the Government, as the new source would require time to develop the skills needed to meet PFPA's immediate requirements. Based on the time constraint and expected increase in cost inherent to awarding to another contractor, it is not in the best interest of the Government to award to any vendor other than SRA.<br /><br />This proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(A). This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A competitive follow-on will be issued after the existing LSB network is upgraded. As a result of this proposed short-term contract action, solicitation number HQ0034-14-R-0015 will be cancelled. <br /><br />THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. The Government does not intend to pay for information provided in response to this publication. Written responses to this synopsis shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bona fide capability to fulfill this requirement. All interested parties shall submit clear and convincing documentation demonstrating their capabilities to satisfy the requirements listed above to Tequilla Wheeler by email at tequilla.n.wheeler.civ@mail.mil. The capability documentation should include general information and technical background describing in detail the prospective contractor's capabilities and experience that will demonstrate the ability to support these requirements.<br />

Point of Contact/SME: Christine Pal Chee, Ph.D.

COR: Cheylynne Bosley, Administrative Officer, CSP

1.	DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE

HERC has created a dataset that contains the health care utilization, health care costs, health conditions, and socio-demographic characteristics of VA patients from FY2007-2012. This dataset allowed us to characterize the highest cost patients in VA and sources of their health care costs. To understand longitudinal patterns in health care utilization and spending of VA patients both within VA and across the VA, Medicare, and Medicaid programs - and to identify predictors of high, persistently high, and transiently high costs - we require this dataset to be augmented and expanded. In particular, we require a longitudinal dataset with the following information for a 20% random sample of Veterans in enrolled in VHA in FY2008:  

-	VA health care utilization, health care costs, health conditions, and socio-demographic characteristics from FY2005-2013
-	Medicare health care utilization, health care costs, and health conditions from FY2005-2011
-	Medicaid health care utilization, health care costs, and health conditions from FY2005-2010

The original SAS programs used to create the FY2007-2012 dataset will need to be revised to include additional years of VA data, and new programs will need to be developed to process and incorporate Medicare and Medicaid data. These data will be used to inform VA programs and clinical managers in the development and implementation of primary care programs aimed at improving the care and lowering costs of VA's highest cost patients. Given our role in current efforts to develop programs throughout the VA for these patients, the timely creation of this data is critical to our work.

The contractor will be responsible for successfully completing the following tasks:

1.	The identification of the population of Veterans enrolled in VHA in FY2008 and the selection of a 20% random sample from that population of enrolled Veterans (hereinafter referred to as "the 20% sample").

2.	The creation of a dataset containing FY2005-2013 VA health care costs and percentiles, by categories of care, for each Veteran in the 20% sample.
3.	The creation of a dataset containing FY2005-2013 socio-demographic characteristics derived from VA Enrollment, Vital Status, and Utilization data for each Veteran in the 20% sample. 

4.	The creation of a dataset containing FY2005-2013 VA health care utilization, by types of care, for each Veteran in the 20% sample.

5.	The creation of a dataset containing FY2005-2013 chronic and acute conditions derived from VA utilization data for each Veteran in the 20% sample.

6.	The creation of a dataset containing FY2005-2011 Medicare costs and percentiles, by categories of care, for each Veteran in the 20% sample.

7.	The creation of a dataset containing FY2005-2011 Medicare utilization, by types of care, for each Veteran in the 20% sample.

8.	The creation of a dataset containing FY2005-2011 chronic and acute conditions derived from Medicare utilization data for each Veteran in the 20% sample.

9.	The creation of a dataset containing FY2005-2010 Medicaid costs and percentiles, by categories of care, for each Veteran in the 20% sample.

10.	The creation of a dataset containing FY2005-2010 Medicaid utilization, by types of care, for each Veteran in the 20% sample.

11.	The creation of a dataset containing FY2005-2010 chronic and acute conditions derived from Medicaid utilization data for each Veteran in the 20% sample.

12.	The creation of a merged dataset containing variables specified by the Government from datasets identified from items 2-11 above.

13.	The calculation and reporting of descriptive statistics for all cost, socio-demographic, utilization, and condition variables by year. 

14.	The calculation and reporting of additional statistics from the merged dataset identified in task 12 above as specified by the Government.

9.	DATA SECURITY

Contractors, contractor personnel, subcontractors, and subcontractor personnel shall be subject to the same Federal laws, regulations, standards, and VA Directives and Handbooks as VA and VA personnel regarding information and information system security. 

10.	ACCESS TO VA INFORMATION AND VA INFORMATION SYSTEMS

10.1	A contractor/subcontractor shall request logical (technical) or physical access to VA information and VA information systems for their employees, subcontractors, and affiliates only to the extent necessary to perform the services specified in the contract, agreement, or task order. 

10.2	All contractors, subcontractors, and third-party servicers and associates working with VA information are subject to the same investigative requirements as those of VA appointees or employees who have access to the same types of information. The level and process of background security investigations for contractors must be in accordance with VA Directive and Handbook 0710, Personnel Suitability and Security Program. The Office for Operations, Security, and Preparedness is responsible for these policies and procedures. 

10.3	Contract personnel who require access to national security programs must have a valid security clearance. National Industrial Security Program (NISP) was established by Executive Order 12829 to ensure that cleared U.S. defense industry contract personnel safeguard the classified information in their possession while performing work on contracts, programs, bids, or research and development efforts. The Department of Veterans Affairs does not have a Memorandum of Agreement with Defense Security Service (DSS). Verification of a Security Clearance must be processed through the Special Security Officer located in the Planning and National Security Service within the Office of Operations, Security, and Preparedness. 

10.4	Custom software development and outsourced operations must be located in the U.S. to the maximum extent practical. If such services are proposed to be performed abroad and are not disallowed by other VA policy or mandates, the contractor/subcontractor must state where all non-U.S. services are provided and detail a security plan, deemed to be acceptable by VA, specifically to address mitigation of the resulting problems of communication, control, data protection, and so forth. Location within the U.S. may be an evaluation factor. 

10.5	The contractor or subcontractor must notify the Contracting Officer immediately when an employee working on a VA system or with access to VA information is reassigned or leaves the contractor or subcontractor's employ. The Contracting Officer must also be notified immediately by the contractor or subcontractor prior to an unfriendly termination. 

11.	VA INFORMATION CUSTODIAL LANGUAGE

11.1	Information made available to the contractor or subcontractor by VA for the performance or administration of this contract or information developed by the contractor/subcontractor in performance or administration of the contract shall be used only for those purposes and shall not be used in any other way without the prior written agreement of the VA. This clause expressly limits the contractor/subcontractor's rights to use data as described in Rights in Data - General, FAR 52.227-14(d) (1). 

11.2	VA information should not be co-mingled, if possible, with any other data on the contractors/subcontractor's information systems or media storage systems in order to ensure VA requirements related to data protection and media sanitization can be met. If co-mingling must be allowed to meet the requirements of the business need, the contractor must ensure that VA's information is returned to the VA or destroyed in accordance with VA's sanitization requirements. VA reserves the right to conduct onsite inspections of contractor and subcontractor IT resources to ensure data security controls, separation of data and job duties, and destruction/media sanitization procedures are in compliance with VA directive requirements. 

11.3	Prior to termination or completion of this contract, contractor/subcontractor must not destroy information received from VA, or gathered/created by the contractor in the course of performing this contract without prior written approval by the VA. Any data destruction done on behalf of VA by a contractor/subcontractor must be done in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) requirements as outlined in VA Directive 6300, Records and Information Management and its Handbook 6300.1 Records Management Procedures, applicable VA Records Control Schedules, and VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization. Self-certification by the contractor that the data destruction requirements above have been met must be sent to the VA Contracting Officer within 30 days of termination of the contract. 

11.4	The contractor/subcontractor must receive, gather, store, back up, maintain, use, disclose and dispose of VA information only in compliance with the terms of the contract and applicable Federal and VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies. If Federal or VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies become applicable to the VA information or information systems after execution of the contract, or if NIST issues or updates applicable FIPS or Special Publications (SP) after execution of this contract, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to implement the information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies in this contract. 

11.5	The contractor/subcontractor shall not make copies of VA information except as authorized and necessary to perform the terms of the agreement or to preserve electronic information stored on contractor/subcontractor electronic storage media for restoration in case any electronic equipment or data used by the contractor/subcontractor needs to be restored to an operating state. If copies are made for restoration purposes, after the restoration is complete, the copies must be appropriately destroyed. 

11.6	If VA determines that the contractor has violated any of the information confidentiality, privacy, and security provisions of the contract, it shall be sufficient grounds for VA to withhold payment to the contractor or third party or terminate the contract for default or terminate for cause under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12. 

11.7	If a VHA contract is terminated for cause, the associated BAA must also be terminated and appropriate actions taken in accordance with VHA Handbook 1600.01, Business Associate Agreements. Absent an agreement to use or disclose protected health information, there is no business associate relationship. 

11.8	The contractor/subcontractor must store, transport, or transmit VA sensitive information in an encrypted form, using VA-approved encryption tools that are, at a minimum, FIPS 140-2 validated. 

11.9	The contractor/subcontractor's firewall and Web services security controls, if applicable, shall meet or exceed VA's minimum requirements. VA Configuration Guidelines are available upon request. 

11.10	Except for uses and disclosures of VA information authorized by this contract for performance of the contract, the contractor/subcontractor may use and disclose VA information only in two other situations: (i) in response to a qualifying order of a court of competent jurisdiction, or (ii) with VA's prior written approval. The contractor/subcontractor must refer all requests for, demands for production of, or inquiries about, VA information and information systems to the VA contracting officer for response. 

11.11	Notwithstanding the provision above, the contractor/subcontractor shall not release VA records protected by Title 38 U.S.C. 5705, confidentiality of medical quality assurance records and/or Title 38 U.S.C. 7332, confidentiality of certain health records pertaining to drug addiction, sickle cell anemia, alcoholism or alcohol abuse, or infection with human immunodeficiency virus. If the contractor/subcontractor is in receipt of a court order or other requests for the above mentioned information, that contractor/subcontractor shall immediately refer such court orders or other requests to the VA contracting officer for response.
 
11.12	For service that involves the storage, generating, transmitting, or exchanging of VA sensitive information but does not require C&A or an MOU-ISA for system interconnection, the contractor/subcontractor must complete a Contractor Security Control Assessment (CSCA) on a yearly basis and provide it to the COR. 

12.	SECURITY INCIDENT INVESTIGATION

12.1	The term "security incident" means an event that has, or could have, resulted in unauthorized access to, loss or damage to VA assets, or sensitive information, or an action that breaches VA security procedures. The contractor/subcontractor shall immediately notify the COR and simultaneously, the designated ISO and Privacy Officer for the contract of any known or suspected security/privacy incidents, or any unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, including that contained in system(s) to which the contractor/subcontractor has access. 

12.2	To the extent known by the contractor/subcontractor, the contractor/subcontractor's notice to VA shall identify the information involved, the circumstances surrounding the incident (including to whom, how, when, and where the VA information or assets were placed at risk or compromised), and any other information that the contractor/subcontractor considers relevant. 

12.3	With respect to unsecured protected health information, the business associate is deemed to have discovered a data breach when the business associate knew or should have known of a breach of such information. Upon discovery, the business associate must notify the covered entity of the breach. Notifications need to be made in accordance with the executed business associate agreement. 

12.4	In instances of theft or break-in or other criminal activity, the contractor/subcontractor must concurrently report the incident to the appropriate law enforcement entity (or entities) of jurisdiction, including the VA OIG and Security and Law Enforcement. The contractor, its employees, and its subcontractors and their employees shall cooperate with VA and any law enforcement authority responsible for the investigation and prosecution of any possible criminal law violation(s) associated with any incident. The contractor/subcontractor shall cooperate with VA in any civil litigation to recover VA information, obtain monetary or other compensation from a third party for damages arising from any incident, or obtain injunctive relief against any third party arising from, or related to, the incident.  

13.	LIQUIDATED DAMAGES FOR DATA BREACH

13.1	Consistent with the requirements of 38 U.S.C. Â§5725, a contract may require access to sensitive personal information. If so, the contractor is liable to VA for liquidated damages in the event of a data breach or privacy incident involving any SPI the contractor/subcontractor processes or maintains under this contract. 

13.2	The contractor/subcontractor shall provide notice to VA of a "security incident" as set forth in the Security Incident Investigation section above. Upon such notification, VA must secure from a non-Department entity or the VA Office of Inspector General an independent risk analysis of the data breach to determine the level of risk associated with the data breach for the potential misuse of any sensitive personal information involved in the data breach. The term 'data breach' means the loss, theft, or other unauthorized access, or any access other than that incidental to the scope of employment, to data containing sensitive personal information, in electronic or printed form, that results in the potential compromise of the confidentiality or integrity of the data. Contractor shall fully cooperate with the entity performing the risk analysis. Failure to cooperate may be deemed a material breach and grounds for contract termination. 

13.3	Each risk analysis shall address all relevant information concerning the data breach, including the following: 

(1)	Nature of the event (loss, theft, unauthorized access); 
(2)	Description of the event, including: 
(a)	date of occurrence; 
(b)	data elements involved, including any PII, such as full name, social security number, date of birth, home address, account number, disability code;
(3)	Number of individuals affected or potentially affected;
(4)	Names of individuals or groups affected or potentially affected; 
(5)	Ease of logical data access to the lost, stolen or improperly accessed data in light of the degree of protection for the data, e.g., unencrypted, plain text; 
(6)	Amount of time the data has been out of VA control; 
(7)	The likelihood that the sensitive personal information will or has been compromised (made accessible to and usable by unauthorized persons); 
(8)	Known misuses of data containing sensitive personal information, if any; 
(9)	Assessment of the potential harm to the affected individuals; 
(10)	Data breach analysis as outlined in 6500.2 Handbook, Management of Security and Privacy Incidents, as appropriate; and 
(11)	Whether credit protection services may assist record subjects in avoiding or mitigating the results of identity theft based on the sensitive personal information that may have been compromised. 

13.4	Based on the determinations of the independent risk analysis, the contractor shall be responsible for paying to the VA liquidated damages in the amount of $37.50 per affected individual to cover the cost of providing credit protection services to affected individuals consisting of the following: 

(1)	Notification; 
(2)	One year of credit monitoring services consisting of automatic daily monitoring of at least 3 relevant credit bureau reports; 
(3)	Data breach analysis; 
(4)	Fraud resolution services, including writing dispute letters, initiating fraud alerts and credit freezes, to assist affected individuals to bring matters to resolution; 
(5)	One year of identity theft insurance with $20,000.00 coverage at $0 deductible; and 

13.5	Necessary legal expenses the subjects may incur to repair falsified or damaged credit records, histories, or financial affairs. 

14.	TRAINING

14.1	All contractor employees and subcontractor employees requiring access to VA information and VA information systems shall complete the following before being granted access to VA information and its systems: 

(1)	Sign and acknowledge (either manually or electronically) understanding of and responsibilities for compliance with the Contractor Rules of Behavior, Appendix E relating to access to VA information and information systems;

14.2	The contractor shall provide to the contracting officer and/or the COR a copy of the training certificates and certification of signing the Contractor Rules of Behavior for each applicable employee within 1 week of the initiation of the contract and annually thereafter, as required. 

14.3	Failure to complete the mandatory annual training and sign the Rules of Behavior annually, within the timeframe required, is grounds for suspension or termination of all physical or electronic access privileges and removal from work on the contract until such time as the training and documents are complete. 

Line 6:
The C&A requirement do not apply and that a security Accreditation Package is not required. 

Line 7:
VA sensitive data will be protected in accordance with the guidelines spelled out in VA handbook 6500 rules of behavior. 

PDAT:

DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS

JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

1.	Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, NCO 21; 2615 E. Clinton Avenue, Fresno, CA 93703.

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  Justification and approval for Other than Full and Open Competition for Jennifer Scott to perform Statistical Programming and Analysis for the VA Palo Alto Healthcare System.  

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:    HERC has created a dataset that contains the health care utilization, health care costs, health conditions, and socio-demographic characteristics of VA patients from FY2007-2012. This dataset allowed us to characterize the highest cost patients in VA and sources of their health care costs. To understand longitudinal patterns in health care utilization and spending of VA patients both within VA and across the VA, Medicare, and Medicaid programs - and to identify predictors of high, persistently high, and transiently high costs - we require this dataset to be augmented and expanded. In particular, we require a longitudinal dataset with the following information for a 20% random sample of Veterans in enrolled in VHA in FY2008

4.	  The total amount of this service is $28,000.      

4.    Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  FAR 6.302-1(a)(2).  The VA's minimum needs can only be satisfied by unique supplies or services available from only one source (41 USC 253 (c) (1)).

5.    Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   Ms. Scott is the creator of the HERC dataset and the programming code to analyze the data.  The research study for which this analysis is required must adhere to time line for completion of tasks as well as funding period limitations.  The task performed by Ms. Scott cannot be replaced by another person in a timely manner and/or at a fair and reasonable price.  Complex programming procedures are involved.    She searched hundreds of diagnosis codes in order to create her program.  Her knowledge of diagnosis codes to create the variables is indispensable and would take substantial effort to replicate this work if she is not able to complete the program.  Developing the SAS program also involves extensive validating and checking records for diagnosis codes that are uncategorized or mis-categorized.  These steps involved complex coding that few other analysts can perform with successful in the given period of time.  Ms. Scott has unique knowledge about this task and her involvement in the project will save HERC considerable time and resources.

       With the background knowledge that Ms. Scott possesses with regard to these programs, she will be able to properly document the procedure in order to provide training for other programmers and statistical analysts.

6.    Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:    Customer has been unsuccessful at locating an alternate source to perform this task in the allotted time and budget. 

7.    Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  A Research Health Science Specialist is classified by OPM in the 601 series.  The salary range for a Health Science Specialist in the San Jose / San Francisco / Oakland area is a GS-12 or $81,460 to $105,897 per year, locality pay included.  Based on this information, $28,000 is well-below the normal rate of pay for similar services.  Based on this information, price is considered  fair and reasonable to the Government.

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  None for reasons stated above in #5.  

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:   None.  

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  None

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  None, for reasons stated above.

12.	Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.  



Approvals in accordance with FAR 6.304 

a.	Contracting Officer's Certification: (required) I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
