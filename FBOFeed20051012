<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems (SPAWAR) Command Program Office (PMW/A-170) at the Naval Air Systems Command of Patuxent River, Maryland is tasked to acquire GAS-1N Antennas, EDO Corporation part number N100-3-1, to be installed on AV-8B Marine Corps Aircraft.  The applicable NAICS is 334511.  The SIC code is 3812.  The size standard is 750 employees.  The estimated quantity of antennas is 166 units as follows: 126 in support of domestic requirements at the Naval Air Systems Command, 13 spares, 15 units in support of Italian Allied requirements, 12 units in support of Spainish Allied requirements, associated integration services, and technical data.  The government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with EDO Corporation Antenna Products and Technologies, 585 Johnson Avenue, Bohemia, New York  11716.  It is anticipated that a Firm Fixed Price contract will be awarded for one base year with four option years, with the base year period beginning 01 January 2006 and ending 31 December 2006 and each subsequent option period to run from 01 January until 31 December.  The estimated delivery schedule shall include the delivery of 34 units in each contracting period or 3 units per month.  EDO Corporation is the designer of the GAS-1N Antenna System pursuant to a Foreign Comparative Testing (FCT) program administered by SPAWAR for U. S. Navy platforms.  As part of the FCT program and follow-on testing with the GAS-1 antenna electronics unit, EDO’s GAS-1N antenna provided the best compatibility for the AV-8B aircraft based on the number of elements, its size, mounting characteristics, and non-symmetrical connector layout needed to overcome physical interference problems on the AV-8B.  There are no competitive data packages or drawings from which another source can build this GAS-1N antenna to fit compatibly with the AV-8B aircraft.  The EDO GAS-1N antenna, EDO part number N100-3-1, has undergone extensive qualification and flight testing and as such, EDO is the only source that can meet the Navy’s fleet deployment requirements for FY 07 without incurring unrecoverable schedule slippages and substantial duplicative costs to the Government.  EDO Corporation has the knowledge, experience and skills required to provide this equipment and as such, is the only source available with the technical expertise to fabricate and deliver the specified components without causing delays and degradation of mission capability for the AV-8B aircraft. In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or service will satisfy the government agency requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and submit technical information and a technical capability statement in response to this notice. The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Contracts, shall consider responses.  Responses without a return address, mailing address, and company telephone number will not be recognized. No phone calls will be accepted.  Proprietary data in the responses will be protected where so designated. NOTE: Contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database to be eligible for contract award or payment from any DOD activity.  A determination not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Any questions regarding this synopsis should be sent via e-mail to roger.mcaughan@navy.mil or to mary.carter@navy.mil.  See Note 22.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement for the design and delivery of the Leadership Alchemy Program for calendar years 2006-2010 for 20 Goddard personnel and potentially 8 other participants from either NASA/HQ or other Agencies.   NASA/GSFC intends to purchase these services from Bridges in Organization,Inc in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1)--Only One Responsible Source. In FY01-FY02 Bridges in Organizations' personnel designed and implemented the first pilot Leadership Alchemy Program for Goddard’s Financial and Resources Management community.  Their involvement ranged from the conceptual and early design phases through program delivery and completion. To date, Bridges in Organizations is responsible for program design and implementation of what is considered a foundational program among Goddard’s leadership development offerings. The Leadership Alchemy Program is a unique developmental program – there are no other similar programs in the public, private, or academic sectors.  Leadership Alchemy adopts an ontological, holistic, and whole-person approach.	It is a rigorous program that encompasses individual and team learning in the context of workshops, Learning Team meetings, mentoring, coaching, interviewing, and shadowing.  The program’s 5 fundamental practices are action learning, appreciative inquiry, emotional intelligence and relationship building, reading and reflection, and developing the presence of the leader.  This uniqueness, along with the program’s effectiveness, was confirmed in an independent case study conducted by The Partnership for Public Service in 2003.  Also, the Federal Consulting Group identified Leadership Alchemy as a Federal Best Practice.  The quality and impact of the program earned national attention and is the subject of a chapter in a leadership book soon to be published by Jossey-Bass.	The coaches and program facilitators are all Certified or Master Certified ontological coaches in accordance with the International Coaching Federation standards.  One of the coaches is also a Master Certified somatic coach – one of only approximately 3 in the U.S. who is also a Certified Ontological Coach.  Products utilized by Bridges in Organizations, Inc. include, and are not limited to, Learning Guides, workshop handouts and materials, workshop posters, a Mentor-Protégé Conversational Guide, and an Alchemist’s Toolkit.  A notable subset of the material is proprietary to Bridges in Organizations, Inc., having been developed by them prior to the Leadership Alchemy Program and provided to NASA GSFC under a fixed price contract.  Given their lead role in designing and implementation of all four Leadership Alchemy Programs, Bridges in Organization, Inc. possesses unique knowledge and expertise resulting in a minimal learning curve, thus requiring the expenditure of fewer hours and dollars.  Their integral involvement since the need for this program was first identified in FY01, provides Bridges in Organization, Inc. with a unique and comprehensive understanding of the program and the workshops to date. This understanding is essential to ensuring that future workshops align with what has been taught and do not unnecessarily repeat content.  It cannot be underestimated how critically important this thread of learning is to participants of NASA and to their contribution as current and future leaders of the Center.  Qualifications aside, there would be a substantial duplication of costs were another contractor given responsibility for Leadership Alchemy.  These costs include the research needed to learn about NASA and its leadership needs; earning certifications in somatic and ontological coaching; establishment of a cadre of certified or master certified coaches; interviews with the Program Manager, past participants, and the Office of Human Resources to identify unique expectations and requirements for the program in general and each workshop in specific ; reading the many books and articles used and conducting a literature search for the state of the art leadership perspectives; and generating replacements for the proprietary Bridges in Organizations, Inc. materials.  In addition to the substantial duplication of costs, it would take an estimated year to bring a contractor up to even a minimal level, precluding the Center’s offering a program in FY06.  Once brought up to that minimal level, the quality of the program would still not equal the current Leadership Alchemy Program.  Based on the preceding, the minimum needs for this requirement can only be met by Bridges-in-Organizations, Inc.   The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on October 27, 2005.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<CONTACT>Donna Kimball, Contracting Officer, Phone (310) 363-6155, Email donna.kimball@losangeles.af.mil - Lt David Kindt, Buyer, Phone (310) 363-0194, Email david.kindt@losangeles.af.mil
<DESC>The purpose of this announcement is to inform potential vendors of the intent of the Global Positioning System (GPS) Modernized User Equipment (MUE) Receiver Card Development Program to release a final Request for Proposal (RFP) on or after 27 October 2005. The response date shall be specified upon release of the RFP.

Interested sources (primes or subcontractors) who have not previously responded should respond to this announcement.  Additionally, interested sources should request access to this information through the established website.  See paragraph entitled, “RFP ACCESS”.   

System Description: The MUE Program is the User Segment component of the GPS modernization effort.  The objective of the MUE Program is to demonstrate the “proof of existence” of MUE by demonstrating the ability to develop MUE receiver card designs, certify them under PRONAV, demonstrate their compliance with the MUE TRD, and ability to develop PVT data using the M-Code signal. To demonstrate this ability the MUE Program seeks to let contracts to design, develop, fabricate, and document two YMCA receiver cards and their required internal support components based on the GPS Receiver Applications Module SEM-E/Modernized (GRAM-S/M) and Ground-based GPS Receiver Applications Module - Modernized Small Serial Interface (GB-GRAM-M-SSI).  These requirements are available at the GPS website.  Instructions on how to access this website are presented at the end of this announcement.  The receiver cards will demonstrate the ability to receive and process the MUE signal as well as validate the Protection of Navigation (PRONAV) security architecture.  Support for demonstration of MUE receiver cards is covered under this effort.    

The MUE Receiver Program does not include production.  It is anticipated that MUE receiver card procurements will be conducted by platform managers for MUE specific to a platform or by the Services to meet Service-wide needs.
To assist respondents in understanding the potential scope of this effort the following program objectives are provided as reference:
  
1.	Design, develop, test, and document a YMCA compliant GRAM-S/M and GB-GRAM-M SSI, ensuring the receiver cards meet the requirements specified by the MUE TRD and other applicable requirements documents.   
2.	Implement a design for the receiver cards that optimizes performance, security, and safety, while allowing for the flexibility of the design to support emerging requirements/applications and minimizing the recurring costs of future YMCA receiver production.
3.	Deliver government approved consolidated MUE Receiver Card Test Plans and procedures for the integration, functional, software, and security testing of both receiver cards.
4.	Verify both receiver cards meet performance, environmental, security, and safety requirements, in accordance with Government-approved contractor MUE Receiver Card Test Plans, MUE Security Certification Plan and MUE TRD.
5.	Generate detailed specifications for each receiver card and its interfaces.
6.	Deliver complete documentation, data, and software for specifying the design, implementation, and production of the developed YMCA receiver cards including detailed information on the core components developed or selected for implementing the cards.
7.	Support Government testing of the GRAM-S/M and GB-GRAM-M SSI cards, in accordance with the Government test and evaluation strategy.
8.	Recommend modifications and enhancements to the GRAM-S/M and GB-GRAM-M SSI card requirements to ensure the implementation of common core receiver card components with the widest application.
9.	Recommend modifications to the GRAM Protection Profile and to the MUE Security Certification Plan, as well as other related specifications, ICDs, and ISs.
10.	Support demonstration of MUE receivers.
11.	Implement a Configuration Management Process as appropriate, consistent with Military Standard - Configuration Management 973.

Potential offerors must have the ability to process, maintain, and store collateral secret and special access required information.

<DESC>THIS IS A CORRECTED VERSION OF MARKET SURVEY NUMBER 0551 WITH A CHANGE IN THE RESPONSE DATE. Contact Michael E. Harris, (732) 532-2453. This is a broad, community-specific market survey to locate sources for supply of numerous avionics items that are  currently in short supply within the Army and are needed immediately to support Army Aviation. In many cases, OEM suppliers are unable to produce sufficient quantities to meet our current needs. Thus, we are interested in buying assets from alternative so urces. Depending upon specific circumstances for the items in question, we might be interested in buying new stock, new old stock, re-conditioned items, or, in some cases, unserviceable items. In some cases, this material may have been purchased by supplie rs as surplus equipment. Depending upon respondents capabilities and the current status of our organic depot repair programs, we might be interested in having the supplier perform refurbishment/repair/overhaul.  Alternatively, we might want to buy the uns erviceable assets and induct these into ongoing organic repair programs that are operating below capacity because of the longstanding paucity of unserviceable returns from the field. Regardless of specific circumstances, any company that possesses ANY sign ificant quantity of Army avionics is encouraged to respond with information regarding those assets that they have available. We have a list of key NSNs of interest that will be provided via e-mail upon request. Companies capable of performing this effort m ay respond by writing to: Commander, USA CECOM, ATTN: AMSEL-LC-CCS-N-AN (MICHAEL E. HARRIS), Fort Monmouth, NJ 07703-5403 or alternatively, contact us via e-mail at: EMAIL ADDRESS avionics@mail1.monmouth.army.mil. This synopsis is for informational purpose s only and not an offer for proposal. For more information, contact Michael E. Harris (732) 532-2453. The deadline for response to this notice is 10 November 2005.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   This is a combined synopsis/request for quote for Commercial Items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only RFQ; quotes are being requested and a written RFQ will not be issued.  This procurement is made on the basis of full and open competition.  The identifying number is RFQ-OH-06-00003.  The NAICS code is 541620 and the size standard is $6 million.  A time and materials purchase order is anticipated to result from the award of this  solicitation.  This procurement is for the project, "The State of Municipal Solid Waste Bioreactor Landfills" required by the National Risk Management Research Laboratory in Cincinnati, OH in accordance with the statement of work.  STATEMENT OF WORK TITLE:  The State of Municipal Solid Waste  Bioreactor Landfills   I.BACKGROUND The US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Office of Research and Development (ORD) Land Remediation Pollution Control Division has been charged with conducting research in the area of solid waste containment and disposal.  This task includes the examination  and evaluation of new technologies such as bioreactor landfills.  There are a growing number of landfill sites in the United States that are operating as bioreactor landfills.  The premise behind bioreactor landfills is the introduction of moisture into the solid waste mass to increasing the solid  waste degradation rate.  The faster rate of waste degradation may produce contamination, in the form of gas and leachate, at an earlier rate than conventional municipal solid waste landfill operations.  Field research has been conducted to assess the potential of bioreactor landfills to enhance the  rate of degradation of solid wastes, increase the rate of landfill gas generation, provide an alternative energy source, and minimize the long-term liability associated with the more conventional waste management units.  As a result, a large amount of information has been collected at various  bioreactor landfill sites.  However, the data, in their present form, are lacking the effective analysis that would support concrete conclusions on the operations of these landfill sites.   II.   PURPOSE AND SCOPE The purpose of this project is to select and examine five currently operational  bioreactor landfills through the thorough examination of existing data available at these sites.  From the research conducted to date, some of the key parameters in managing landfill as bioreactors are needed to be identified.  This work will assist those responsible for regulatory oversight and  the site owner/operators in monitoring this process. Prior to award, the EPA requires that each interested party shall provide a list of at least 10 potential bioreactor landfill sites for the study.  The list should include monitoring parameters available for examination at each of the ten  locations.  These 10 sites with the help of the project office will be reduced to a final five to be examined. III. TASKS TASK 1.  Kickoff Meeting: The meeting with the EPA staff (may be conducted via conference call) should take place within a week of project award.  The main purpose of the  meeting is to define the roles and responsibilities of the various parties and finalize the five sites that will be included in the case study. TASK 2.  Preparation and Submittal of QAPP: The preparation and submittal of Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) is the responsibility of the contractor  and the project will not proceed without an EPA approved QAPP plan.  The contractor shall prepare and adhere to data quality assurance project plan (QAPP) as it applied to the analysis of secondary data as defined in Attachment A of this statement of work.  Task 2 needs to be completed within 4  weeks of contract award. TASK 3.  Preparation and Submittal of the First Draft Report: The EPA is requesting that a draft report with detailed examination of data collected from 3 (of the 5) sites be submitted for EPA for review within 6 months of contract award.  The report should provide a sound  foundation upon which to build the final report.  The contractor shall prepare the draft report in accordance with EPA publishing requirements.  The report needs to address the following areas for each of the 3 sites: 1.Rigorous analytical examination of available (physical and analytical) data and  implications on the landfill performance.  Analysis should include at least the following parameter: a. Biological Processes i. Solid waste decomposition b. Physical Processes i. Solid waste settlement ii. Leachate production iii. Liquid introduction iv. Liquid Sourcev.Outside Liquid Quantity vi.  Slope stability c.Chemical Processes i. Landfill gas production ii.Landfill gas quality iii.NMOC production and emissions iv.Leachate composition d.Identify performance data that can be generalize to other bioreactor landfills. Task 4.  Meeting with EPA personnel at EPA/ORD office: The contractor  shall present the finding of the study to EPA personnel in Cincinnati OH.  The contractor shall prepare and present a power point presentation that outlines the performance of the five bioreactor landfill sites studied.Task 5.  Second draft report: A draft final report that includes a detailed  examination of data collected from all five sites shall be provided for EPA for review and comments within 10 months of contract award.  The contractor shall prepare the draft report in accordance with EPA publishing requirements.  The report needs to address the areas outlined in task 3 for each  of the five sites.  Furthermore the report shall identify the performance of the bioreactor landfills and generalize the finding and conclusions to other bioreactor landfill sites.  The report shall give a sound foundation upon which to consider the performance and permitting of bioreactor  landfills assisted by the study conducted under this project. TASK 6.  Final Report and Accepted Technical Journal Article: The contractor shall address comments provided by EPA reviewers to the draft report and a final report shall be submitted 11 months after contract award.  The contractor shall  also provide a journal article to the EPA that outlines the major findings of this study.  The article shall be accepted for publication by a technical journal and shall be formatted in accordance with the journal requirements.  The contractor shall submit the accepted journal article 11 months  after contract award.

<DESC>The MDA intends to award a 33-month sole source cost-plus fixed-fee follow-on contract modification to Engineering Management Concepts, Inc. (EMC), under Contract HQ0006-02-C-0037, for continuation of a Financial Integration and Assessment capability through December 31, 2009 in contractor leased/MDA government and contractor occupied facilities.  This extension will be for the minimum amount of time necessary to avoid disruption of essential services until MDA relocates to Fort Belvoir, Virginia and Redstone Arsenal, Alabama per Base Realignment and Closing decisions.

The modification will ensure uninterrupted financial integration and assessment capabilities and continued availability of the leased space from April 2007 to December 2009, thereby promoting managerial, budgetary, and administrative efficiency and ensuring the continuation of essential financial integration and assessment capabilities and activities related to MDA program planning and acquisition strategy, programming, and investment analysis.  EMC is the only company capable of providing MDA with the required integrated financial management capability in a cost effective manner for the additional period of performance.  Any new contract vehicle to replicate current capabilities would entail substantial costs for facility build-out and MDA operations relocation.  MDA has already invested such costs in the build-out of the existing leased space under the EMC contract.  As such, award to any other source(s) would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that would not be recovered through competition.

<DESC>The Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) intends to enter into a long-term Firm-Fixed Price (with Economic Price Adjustment) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract to support the worldwide demand for Johnson & Johnson Ortho-Clinical Diagnostic Cost-Per-Test (CPT) Laboratory, Chemistry, Hematology, Coagulation, Urinalysis, Microbiology, and Blood Bank diagnostic reagents. Through Market Research it has been determined that Johnson & Johnson diagnostic reagents are specifically configured to support Johnson & Johnson’s testing systems employed at the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) worldwide. No other manufacturer or distributor can provide the Johnson & Johnson diagnostic reagents to Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) customers on a CPT basis. It has been determined that there is only one known manufacturer, Johnson & Johnson, who has the capability of providing Johnson & Johnson CPT reagents.

This solicitation will require Johnson & Johnson to submit a catalog detailing all of the diagnostic reagents for each MTF serviced. All prices for Laboratory, Chemistry, Hematology, Coagulation, Urinalysis, Microbiology, and Blood Bank diagnostic reagents must be developed based on the CPT pricing methodology. Under the CPT pricing methodology Johnson & Johnson provides the testing equipment to the individual MTF’s at no cost to the government. A “usage fee” to use the equipment, service and training is amortized over the reagents that are used on that equipment, which is consistent with commercial practice.  Johnson & Johnson will be asked to provide tables detailing the reagents, add-on options and any additional discounts. Johnson & Johnson will be required to supply all supporting price documentation needed to determine each customer CPT price and ECAT catalog(s) with an inclusive price for each MTF serviced. The price for all reagents may be adjusted annually for those customers who did not meet the previous years annual committed usage volume or who have a change in their product mix. All increases in catalog prices charged to each customer will be recalculated using the pricing tables (e.g. reagent, add-on and discount). A price decrease can occur any time throughout the life of the contract.  The DSCP reserves the right to add new Johnson & Johnson diagnostic CPT reagents and related sole source supplies on a post award basis in compliance with the requirements outlined in the Competition in Contracting Act.  
 CONUS catalogs will include Federal facilities located in the 48 Contiguous States and the District of Columbia, as well as Alaska and Hawaii.  Pricing for the CONUS catalogs will be FOB Destination inclusive of transportation, handling cost or any additional fees. OCONUS catalogs will include Federal facilities located outside the continental United States.  Pricing shall be inclusive of overseas packaging costs, handling costs or any additional fees but exclusive of all transportation costs. The Government’s commercial transportation carrier will be used to deliver products to OCONUS customers.  After contract award, there will be no allowance for additional cost(s) or fees for any item awarded under this procurement initiative. 
All Purchase Order, Purchase Order Confirmation and Invoice transactions under this contract are required to be electronic. The contractor is required to use ECAT to electronically receive 850- Purchase Orders, transmit 997-Functional  Acknowledgement’s, send 855-Order Confirmation’s, and transmit 810-Invoice’s for payment. There are (2) two communication options available for ECAT; Web Supplier Interface and American National Standard Institute (ANSI) X 12 EDI Standard. Johnson & Johnson must have the capability of using at least one of these eCommerce communication options. They will be required to successfully complete system testing prior to receiving an award under this solicitation.
The contract resultant from this solicitation will have a one (1) year base period with four (4) one-year unilateral option periods. This procurement has an estimated dollar value of $35,000,000.00 over the total contract period. Solicitation SP0200-05-R-5013 is expected to become available October 31, 2005 and can be found on the DLA Procurement Gateway at http://progate.daps.dla.mil/home/.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<RESPDATE>102705
<ARCHDATE>12262005
<CONTACT>Dana Herndon, 301-619-7140
<DESC>The United States Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) intends to award a purchase order on a sole-source basis to Affymetrix, Sunnyvale, CA., pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, for the purchase of Affymetrix GeneChips or Arrays that are requir ed for use in Vaccine Genomis Lab Projects at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR).  These expendable genechips are exclusively utilized in the Affymetrix GeneChip Analysis System instrument which is used to process and to scan the expression  profiles of genes in the ra, mouse, human and plant samples.  The Affymetrix GeneChip Analysis System offers a unique technology for obtaining and evaluating genetic information through the analysis of nucleic acids.  The system comprises instruments and software capable of running application-specific assays.  At the core of the system is the expendable GeneChip or Array, unique to Affymetrix, which utilizes ogligonucleotide probe arrays that are manufactured by Affymetrixs proprietary, light-directed ch emical synthesis process, combining solid phase chemical synthesis with photolithographic fabrication techniques employed in the semiconductor industry.  The probe arrays (with tens to hundreds of thousands of oligonucleotide probes) are synthesized on the  surface of miniature chips that are then housed in a cartridge to provide a working chamber for hybridization.  GeneChips are available from Affymetrix to assess rat, mouse, human, plant and viral targets.  Fluorescently labeled target sequences are prepa red from freshly extracted nucleic acid samples using primers specific for the gene or genes of interest.  Hybridization to the probe arrays is controlled by the Affymetrix fluidic station designed to process the GeneChip probe array cartridges in an effic ient, automated manner.  The subsequent hybridization of the labeled target to the specific, known sequences on the array, is detected by an automated confocal scanning argon laser system specifically integrated with the Affymetrix software package.  Probe s that match segments of the target exactly will bind more target, and hence will have higher fluorescence.  The Affymetrix imaging software translates the intensity information into DNA sequencing data, which will highlight differences between the target sequences and the reference or standard sequences known for the gene(s) of interest.  The GeneChips and associated reagents have been in use for seven years in the WRAIR Affymetrix GeneChip laboratory and currently support 13 ongoing studies using this tec hnology.  USAMRAA intends to award this requirement under Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  A firm-fixed-price type award is planned.  Interested respondents who feel that they are capable of meeting these requirements may identify their interest by subm itting technical documentation demonstrating capability to Dana Herndon at FAX No. 301-619-3002 by noon 27 October 2005.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  No telephone requests will be accepted.

<DESC>The United States Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) intends to award a purchase order on a sole-source basis to Guava Technologies, Hayward, CA, pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, to acquire the Guava Personal Cell Analysis (PCA) System to s upport the Department of Retrovirologys research at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR).  Guava Technologies is the sole source of the Guava PCA, which is a bench top flow microcapillary system that utilizes easy to use instruments, turnkey  software, and optimized reagents to perform single cell analysis in a micro centrifuge format.  It requires as little as 20ul of neat sample and as few as 1,000 to 2,000 total cells to perform an analysis and works with both adherent and non-adherent cell s.  The system uses a patented flow cell that is made of fused silica with a polyimide coating that requires no alignment following replacement; there is a high-pressure purge of the flow cell available for removing obstruction in the flow cell and the sam ple is aspirated through the flow cell using a high precision micro syringe.  The Guava PCA has a very small footprint allowing for minimal space on the bench top.  This system is ideal for use in USMHRP Africa sites.  The system has many dedicated softwar e and reagent applications but the most applicable to WRAIRs use are ViaCount for performing absolute cell counts and viability assessments and Easy CD4 for CD4+ assessment using a small volume of whole blood.  USAMRAA intends to award this requirement un der Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  A firm-fixed-price type award is planned.  Interested respondents who feel that they are capable of meeting these requirements may identify their interest by submitting technical documentation and resumes demonstrati ng capability to Dana Herndon at FAX No. 301-619-3002 by noon 27 October 2005.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  No telephone requests will be accepted.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY TO PRE-QUALIFY VENDORS.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME AND THIS IS NOT A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  The United States Secretary of the Senate (hereinafter referred to as “the Secretary”) is seeking a qualified source to conduct a study of employment compensation, hiring, and benefits practices.  The study shall focus on organizational planning, pay band studies, market pay studies, compensation surveys, salary surveys, salary comparison studies and job analysis to summarize job descriptions which communicate job requirements, support wage and salary administration, and are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.  The budget for this project shall not exceed $80,000.  The Secretary invites all qualified sources to respond to this sources sought notice.  In order to be considered for the pre-qualification process, all interested parties must submit information that addresses each item listed above and in the Requirements and Instructions sections of this document.  Requirements: The vendor response to this sources sought notice shall specifically address the two evaluation criteria below.  The evaluation criteria for selection, listed in descending order of importance, are as follows: (1) Firm experience and past performance: The primary firm and sub-contractors must have specific experience, within the last five years, involving the study of employment compensation, hiring, and benefits practices.  The vendor shall list five projects, within the last five years, provide a detailed project description, and any other supplemental information necessary to demonstrate their specific experience, involving the study of employment compensation, hiring, and benefits practices. Firms are encouraged to provide any available documentation that would indicate their ability to complete projects on time and within budget, their ability to respond to changing workload requirements and schedules, and the overall satisfaction of past customers with their work.  Responses must include complete and current contact information of the past customers; the Senate will check references as necessary to evaluate past performance.  Experience and past performance will be evaluated on the basis of its breadth and depth, its similarity to the Senate project as well as the satisfaction of clients and overall quality of services represented by the projects described; and (2) Assignment of Personnel: The vendor must identify principals and individuals that would be assigned to work on the projects under the contract.  Designated employees must have specific experience, within the last five years, with projects involving the study of employment compensation, hiring, and benefits practices.  Personnel will be evaluated on the basis of the similarity of their experience to that expected to be required on work to be performed for the Secretary and on the overall quality of their work as represented by the projects described.  Failure to provide information on Requirements  1 and 2 above may result in disqualification of the vendor from consideration.  An evaluation team will review all vendor responses to select the most qualified vendors.  At the completion of the evaluation the Secretary reserves the right to issue a solicitation for the study of employment compensation, hiring, and benefits practices only to the most qualified vendors.  Responses must contain Firm Information: (Company Name, Address, Point of Contact, Telephone Number, Email address, DUNS Number and Tax ID Number).  INSTRUCTIONS: Responses to this sources sought request are due to the POC no later than October 24, 2005 at 12:00 Noon EDT and shall be submitted electronically via email only to the attention of Kathleen M. Haddow at acquisitions@saa.senate.gov.   The subject line of the email message shall be 2006-S-001 Compensation Study.  No other method of transmittal will be accepted.  The response shall not exceed fifteen (15) pages.  Pages over the page limitation will be discarded.  Senate access to information in any files attached to the response is the responsibility of the submitting party and neither the Senate nor the Secretary is responsible for any failure to access vendor’s information.  The information supplied in response to this sources sought notice will be used to pre-qualify firms that may be invited to submit proposals.  Firms responding to this sources sought notice and deemed qualified by the Senate will be placed on a solicitation mailing list.  Only pre-qualified firms will be permitted to submit proposals.  If suitable responses are received from qualified sources, the Secretary anticipates release of a solicitation in November 2005.  Neither the Senate nor the Secretary will be responsible for any costs for the preparation of responses to this request.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES THE ENTIRE SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE AND IS THE ONLY INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE SECRETARY OR U.S. SENATE.  ANY TELEPHONE OR E-MAIL REQUESTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WILL NOT BE HONORED.

<DESC>BSA/BNL is seeking to maximize competition for this Vertical Focusing X-Ray Mirror System.

The NSLS X25 beamline requires a new meridional focusing mirror system, to focus the beam vertically.  The mirror will be located at 23.0 m from the source, and the nominal focal position is at 26.5 m from the source, therefore the nominal focus demagnification is 6.6:1.  The FWHM value of the horizontal source size is 0.784 mm, of the horizontal source divergence is 0.449 mrad, of the vertical source size is 0.017 mm, and of the vertical source divergence is 0.061 mrad.  There will be placed, upstream of the mirror at 20.3 m from the source position, a double Si(111) crystal monochromator which incorporates a sagittal focusing second crystal to focus the beam horizontally, at a nominal demagnification of 3.3:1.  The range of tunability of the monochromator will span from a minimum energy of 4.5 keV or less to a maximum energy of 20 keV or greater.  The mirror will act upon the monochromatic beam, and will operate at a nominal glancing angle of incidence of 3 mrad.  The mirror will need to reflect the chosen photon energy, that is diffracted by the fundamental Si(111) Bragg reflection of the monochromator, and not to reflect the allowed harmonics (Si(333) and higher).  To preserve the glancing angle of incidence, more than one reflecting strip will need to be included on the mirror’s surface (e.g. there could be two strips, one of which is uncoated and the other of which is a palladium or rhodium coating, in the event that the mirror substrate is silicon or glass).  The mirror system will include a bender that can shape the mirror to the proper figure, a UHV enclosure, and a manipulation system.

All interested manufacturers should contact Jody Mitchell via email to:  jmitchell@bnl.gov for a formal RFP.  IN THE SUBJECT LINE OF THE EMAIL, YOU MUST WRITE RFP #JM100827.  Failure to do this will result in non receipt of RFP.

<DESC>1.	General:  The Naval Surface Warfare Center-Crane Division (NSWC-CD) has a requirement to procure Tactical Power Units (TPU) for use with Marine Corps Tactical Remote Sensor Systems (TRSS).  TRSS uses hand emplaced sensors and retransmission systems in support of the field commander’s intelligence collection effort by providing continuous, wide area surveillance of the battlefield.  The TRSS surveillance capabilities are being limited by power constraints.  The ability to use external power units with long life capabilities will enhance mission life, and reduce the need to redeploy Marines in hazardous environments to change batteries.   2.	Power requirements are listed as follows: a.	TRSS devices accept external power in the range of 10.5 to 17V DC range.  A nominal source of 13 VDC is desired.   b.	TPUs must use solar energy as the primary power source when available.  Assume a minimum of eight hours of unobstructed sunlight per day. c.	TPUs must be capable of using BA-5390 batteries as a backup or primary power source when a solar collector is not used or not sufficient. d.	 The TPU must be capable of providing primary power for devices with the following power profiles:  	Device A.  Idle Current (constant requirement): 4.9 mA  		      Active Current:  950 mA for 0.25 seconds, 40 times per hour.  	Device B.  Idle Current (constant requirement): 20 mA  		      Active Current:  1.54A for 0.25 seconds, 300 times per hour.  	Device C.  Idle Current (constant requirement): 27 mA  		      Active Current: 2.5A for 0.25 seconds, 300 times per hour.  	Device D.  Idle Current (constant requirement): 50mA  		      Active Current:  2 A for 1 second, 100 times per hour. 3.	The TPU shall operate in environments consistent with MIL-STD 810F for ground equipment.  Key requirements are: a.	Operating temperatures ranging from -25 to 58 degrees Celsius. b.	Immersion for 24 hours at 1 meter (less solar collector). c.

Two physical configurations, both capable of using solar energy as primary power source.  One configuration shall house one BA-5390; another configuration shall house three BA-5390s. b.	Up to three TPU’s shall be capable of being daisy chained together (voltage shall be in parallel). 5.	Size and weight requirements for the TPU’s are as follows: a.	Single BA-5390/U configuration 1)	Maximum volume shall not exceed 670 cubic inches 2)	Maximum weight shall not exceed 3 lbs. b.	Triple BA-5390/U configuration 1)	Maximum volume shall not exceed 2100 cubic inches. 2)	Maximum weight shall not exceed 8 lbs. 6.	Interface Connector Requirements: a.	Connector to daisy chain TPU’s or solar collector. b.	Connector to power TRSS equipment; MIL-C-38999 Series II Receptacle with pins and insert arrangement 10-99 (two negative, two positive). Responses:  A strong, demonstrated background in electrical and solar energy collection and dissemination in small, transportable configurations is foreseen as critical in meeting the TRSS Program’s requirement.

The system's basic functionality must include automated intercept and direction finding (DF) capability. There are two identical existing antenna arrays at two remote locations, with a T1 microwave data link to a single operations center. Responses should include:      a. System size, weight, and prime power consumption. Basic functional blocks to include but not limited to: tuners, signal processing, analysis tools, DF processing, display/audio dissemination elements.      b. Operating modes and specified performance (provide a copy of the performance specification) along with technical capabilities for each mode.      c. The existing antenna array with distribution network will remain as the baseline for the system. Augmentation as necessary to accommodate special modern threat signals is anticipated. The existing array is a reference dipole within the angle of four dip oles perpendicular to four other dipoles. f.  System maintenance support concept . g.  The upgraded features sought, relative to the existing HF DF and intercept system, are automation and modern signals capability. h. Desired features: 	1) Automation: Search for signalsboth live signals (real time search) and an ability to scan stored signals. Detect and DF signals. Identify signal modulation. Demodulate. Record and store signals and parameters. Produce report of signal activity (includ ing DF bearings and time tags).   Manually recall from recorded memory the desired signal and listen to it and analyze it. 	2) Modern signals: low probability of intercept signals; digital signals; waterfall display. i. Installation at the operations center will be four (4) posts each with up to 4 receivers accessible for each operator, expandable by multiples of four. One post will have supervisor capabilities.   Dual screens are desired for each operator. k.

<SUBJECT>Y -- SOLE SOURCE, PHASE II HICKAM AFB, MILITARY FAMILY HOUSING PRIVATIZATION
<DESC>The Department of Air Force intends to negotiate with Actus Lend Lease Holdings LLC, on a sole source basis for the privatization of an additional 1118 units of military family housing at Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii, and Bellows Air Force Station, Hawaii in a Non-FAR Real Estate Transaction.  The transaction will not be funded directly with appropriated funds, but instead will be funded from tenant rental payments, including allotments from individual military service members’ monthly basic allowance for housing payments.  Such transactions require the developer to renovate, construct, maintain, repair, operate and manage for a period of approximately 50 years.  Estimated Transaction Closing: 31 July 2006.  THIS IS A SOLE SOURCE FOLLOW-ON TO A PRIOR COMPETITIVELY-AWARDED NON-FAR REAL ESTATE TRANSACTION with Hickam Community Housing, LLC, an affiliate of Actus Lend Lease Holdings LLC, to privatize an initial quantity of approximately 1336 residential units at Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii.  NO DATA/DRAWINGS AVAILABLE.  The approximate solicitation issue date will be 1 Dec 05.  Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2872 et seq.  Justification:  An attempt to compete this requirement would result in substantial duplication of costs not recoverable through competition, and unacceptable schedule delays.  One project owner minimizes force protection security concerns.  This synopsis is informational only and is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, developers interested in providing an offer, must be able to demonstrate in writing, by 7 Nov 05, their capability to privatize the required units despite the lack of priority referrals and despite the lack of a waterfall that permits the filling of vacancies in core base areas with non-military tenants.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the agency not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the agency.  The agency will not pay for any information received.  A sole source, Non-FAR Real Estate Transaction RFP will be posted www.eypsc.com on or about 1 Dec 05.  It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described real estate transaction contact the incumbent developer listed.  The point of contact for this real estate transaction and any submissions is Kim Marchand, the Ernst & Young Team, c/o Emax Partners LLC, 1325 G Street NW, Suite 500, Washington, D.C. 20005; e-mail: kimmarchand@emaxllc.com; telephone: (202) 449-7723.

Are you looking for one FTE equivalent to provide these services; in essence, 2080 hours of service per year?   A3.	Although the FBO announcement states a "Human Resources Management Specialist", the Government desires the most cost effective, best value proposal based on your proposed solution to meet our requirements.

The award is to be a 100% small business set-aside as stated in the FBO announcement. Q5.	Are you seeking one resume of proposed HR person or more than one resume? A5.	As stated in the solicitation/synopsis, this contract is for the full time services of a Human Resources Management Specialist.  However, the Government desires the most cost effective, best value proposal based on your proposed solution to meet our requirements.  Also, see answers to similar questions herein. Q.6	Is GSA pricing required?  Is the contract being procured off of a GSA schedule?  A.6 	This is not a GSA schedule buy.  However, we encourage your best pricing.   Q7.	What is the dollar range?  How much money is allotted in the budget for this contract?	 A7.	The Government desires the most cost effective, best value proposal.

Who will have input into the final decision and what role(s) do they play? A11.	Offers will be evaluated by a technical committee, which includes a Contracting Officer.  In accordance with FAR 15.303, the contracting officer is designated as the source selection authority. Q12.	Obviously, the agency is concerned about the high-level status of this position.  What are your other concerns with this project? A.12	The intent of this question is unclear.  The Government's requirements are as stated in the announcement posted on October 4, 2005.   Q13.	What are you most worried about that might go wrong? A13. 	The intent of this question is unclear.  The Government's requirements are as stated in the announcement posted on October 4, 2005.   Q14.

In what pricing increment should we present the firm fixed price proposal (per hour? per month?) A17.	The firm fixed price proposal should be on a per year basis. Q18.	Is this solicitation only for 1 FTE? A18.	As stated in the solicitation/synopsis, this contract is for the full time services of a Human Resources Management Specialist.  However, the Government desires the most cost effective, best value proposal based on your proposed solution to meet our requirements.  Also, see answers to similar questions herein. Q19.	Typically, federal HR people have 1-2 specific areas of expertise with an exposure to other HR operational areas.  Are you expecting that one person be an expert in all these areas? A19. 	The selected candidate should be a "Generalist" with a solid background in all areas of HR support.  The knowledge of Indian Preference is very important to this position as well as the understanding of how the political employee is handled as opposed to the regular Federal employee. Q20.	Is a clearance required? A20.	Yes, the attached clauses apply to this acquisition and will be incorporated into the subsequent award. Q21.	What time does the work day start / end? A21.	Core hours are between 7:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Monday through Friday.  Therefore, the contractor cannot start before 7a.m. or leave before 3:30p.m.  However, this may be negotiated after award.

IT SECURITY CLAUSES SECURITY REQUIREMENTS, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY/COMPULSORY PROTECTION OF SENSITIVE/PROPRIETARY INFORMATION AND SECURITY ACCESS REQUIREMENTS - MINERALS MANAGEMENT SERVICE (MAY 2005) BASIC CLAUSE Background Investigation Contractor employees who have access to the Department of the Interior (DOI) information technology (IT) systems or will develop custom applications are subject to OPM administered background investigations.  The type of background investigation required is based on the risk/sensitivity level designation.  Guidance for determining the appropriate type of background investigation required for the designated risk/sensitivity level is contained in DOI Departmental Manual (DM) Part 441, Chapter 3.  The DM is available on the Internet at http://elips.doi.gov/app_home/index.cfm?fuseaction=home. The risk/sensitivity level designation of the activities performed under this contract is moderate risk and requires a basic background investigation.  The Contractor shall complete the required background investigation forms and submit to the Contracting Officer (CO) 14 calendar days prior to performing work on the contract.  The MMS Bureau Security Office (BSO) shall determine if individuals meet the required background investigation standards and make a suitability determination.    Minimum standards used in suitability determinations are contained in the DOI Departmental Manual Part 441, Chapter 5.  The Minerals Management Service (MMS) will pay for any background investigations required for contractor employees.  Existing clearances at the same or higher level are acceptable upon the BSO's review and approval. Contractor employees occupying high risk public trust positions shall be reinvestigated every 5 years.  A reinvestigation may be initiated prior to the normal periodic reinvestigation schedule when an individual's continued ability to meet the minimum background investigation standards is in question.  The BSO shall review the records and documentation and make the suitability. In the event of a disagreement between the Contractor and the Government concerning the suitability of a particular employee to perform work under this contract, the Government shall have the right of final determination. Determinations under this requirement are subject to the Disputes Clause.  Failure of the Contractor to comply with the requirements of this clause could constitute grounds for termination for default. Information Protection The term "sensitive information" means any information which warrants a degree of protection and technical, operational, and administrative control as defined by the MMS or that meets the criteria for exemption from public disclosure set forth under Sections 552 and 552a of Title 5, United States Code: the Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy Act.  Sensitive information is generally categorized as For Official Use Only (FOUO) and shall include other unclassified information and proprietary data. (The protection of classified information is beyond the scope of this clause.  If any work on classified information is required under this contract, it is addressed under other contract clauses.)  The Contractor shall protect this type of information from unauthorized release into public domain, or to unauthorized persons, organizations, or subcontractors.  Information which, either alone or in aggregate, is deemed sensitive or proprietary by the MMS shall be protected as instructed by MMS in accordance with the magnitude of the loss or harm that could result from inadvertent or deliberate disclosure, alteration, or destruction of the data.  All provisions of this clause also apply to all subcontractors that are performing under this contract. Non-disclosure Agreement Contractor employees who will have access to DOI information or will develop custom applications must sign a non-disclosure agreement prior to gaining access.  A sample is attached.  Upon award the CO will provide the final agreement to the Contractor.  The Contractor shall execute the agreement(s) and submit them to the CO. Training The Contractor shall ensure its employees complete all MMS/DOI required IT security training.  The Contractor's employees shall complete this training before being granted access to MMS/DOI data or being issued a user account.  The current training requirements are: (i) annual end-user IT Security Awareness (1 hour), (ii) annual IT Resources Rules of Behavior (1 hour), and (iii) annual IT security training for IT professionals (8 hours).  The contractor shall comply with all MMS/DOI IT security training requirements in effect during contract performance.  The COTR will notify the Contractor of all MMS mandatory IT training.  The Contractor shall submit a letter to the COTR and CO certifying each employee's completion of the required training.  This letter shall include; (i) employees name, (ii) date training completed, and (iii) description of training. Access to Contractor's Facilities The Contractor shall afford MMS and the Department of the Interior Office of Inspector General access to the Contractor's and subcontractors' facilities, installations, operations, documentation, databases, and personnel used in performance of the contract.  Access shall be provided to the extent required to carry out a program of IT inspection, investigation and audit that will safeguard against threats and hazards to the integrity, availability and confidentiality of MMS data or to the function of computer systems operated on behalf of MMS, and to preserve evidence of computer crime.  If the Contractor questions the Government employee's right to access its facilities, it should contact the CO for resolution. Personnel Changes The Contractor shall immediately notify the CO and BSO when an employee working on a MMS/DOI system is reassigned or leaves the Contractor's employment and prior to any unfriendly termination. Contractor Location Custom software development and outsourced operations shall be located in the United States to the maximum extent practical.  If such services are proposed to be performed abroad, the Contractor shall provide an acceptable security plan that addresses the mitigation of problems related to communication, control, and protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of IT systems and information. Applicable Standards The Contractor shall follow the DOI System Development Life Cycle (SDLC), National Institute of Standards & Technology (NIST) SP 800-64, and the DOI SDLC Security Integration Guide.  NIST documents are available on the internet at http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/.  The contractor shall request copies of DOI documents by contacting the CO or BSO.
