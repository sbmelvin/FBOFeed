Continuing a legacy of outstanding public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission our nation’s most talented architects, landscape architects, interior designers, and engineers to design federal buildings of outstanding quality and value. These projects are to demonstrate the value of true integrated design that balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees; and give contemporary form and meaning to our democratic values.  In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design Services in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements.  

GSA is seeking Architect-Engineering (A/E) Design Services for demolition of shell and tenant areas, including hazardous material (HAZMAT) abatement and removal, of the Phase 1B (Base) and Phase 1C (Option) portion of New State for the United States Department of State (DOS) Harry S Truman Building.   This building has been the subject of a number of studies and surveys.  The most relevant are:  Modernization of Department of State Harry S Truman Building, Program Development Study, Gensler, August 2004;  Modernization of Department of State Building, Prospectus Development Evaluation, April 1, 1992, by Howard Needles Tammen & Bergendoff (HNTB); and prior to this Department of State Prospectus Development Study, August 15, 1988, by Kemmitzer Reed and Hafler (KRH).  The Program Development Study (PDS) references relevant studies and recent renovation projects.  These three studies and the ongoing space planning being carried out by Gensler are the basis for this work.


PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

The project will involve demolition of shell and tenant areas, including HAZMAT abatement, inclusive of systems upgrades and code updates in the June 1997, HNTB construction documents (CDs), plus new interior design services (build-outs) of both phases, and new additional workspaces based in the 2004 Gensler PDS.  

SCOPE OF WORK:

The goals for this procurement are as follows:  identification of existing field conditions (inclusive of telecom and security), especially that which is not part of Phase 1B and Phase 1C and may be running through these spaces as a matter of convenience; design and development of construction documents and schedules with full consideration to the GSA fund schedule and availability for a complete modernization; maintain Suite 2531 in operation while house HVAC equipment and electrical systems are taken out of service and modernized; allowance for proper egress and exit; verification of existing conditions.  Design of the project will include work around Suite 7528 which must remain in operation throughout construction, this space will be accommodated for survivability by DOS prior to the start of Phase 1B renovation and field verification of existing conditions.  Design of the project shall also incorporate DOS’s plan to remove approximately 16 linear feet of Room 6818 from Phase 1B to Phase 1C and reassess conditions to delete this space from Phase 1B. 

The elevator lobbies and entrances, limited office suites, façade, and other selective areas are historic. The existing facility contains 234,000 gross square feet with parking spaces in the basement. The present structure will be completely modernized and new structures will be added to create modern spaces. Approximately 5/6 of the building will be occupied during construction.

Offers may be submitted on company letterhead stationery indicating the National Stock Number, Nomenclature, Part Number and Unit Price.   NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.

The RFP will be for Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) for the Navy’s nineteen C-9 (17 C9B and 2 DC9), the USAF’s three C-9 aircraft and NASA’s one DC-9.  The effort is scheduled to commence on or about JUL 2006.     The proposed contract will be an indefinite delivery type contract with a minimum ordering requirement for the base year and four option years. The Government will place orders for site support, airframe depot maintenance, engine depot maintenance and related work as part of the ordering provisions of the contract.  The contract will include the ability to order aircraft or engine modifications but the Government makes no assertion that this type of work will be done on this proposed contract.  There will be fixed prices for these requirements as well as provisions for over and above labor and material.  The contract will contain a twelve month base period and four twelve month option periods, from JUL 2006 through JUN 2011, and will be a standard FAR Part 15 contract. 

There are three distinct efforts to be procured under this CLS solicitation, Site Support, Airframe Depot and Engine Depot: 
(a) Site support will be at Atlanta NAS, Norfolk NAS, Whidbey Island NAS, Willow Grove NAS, Cherry Point MCAS, and Scott AFB.   The site support effort consists of issuing parts and materials, assembling kits, receiving items for repair or overhaul, and providing replenishing inventory at each on-site storeroom.  The Government owns a considerable inventory of parts that will be managed by the site support contractor. 

(b) Airframe depot maintenance services (SDLMs, PDMs, MTIs) for the Navy, USAF and NASA necessary to meet C-9 aircraft operational requirements .  Also included will be unscheduled maintenance/drop ins and field team maintenance that occurs away from the Contractor’s designated depot facility, via Contractor Field Teams or Contractor selected Subcontractors and Vendors.  Note that two Navy DC-9s are slated for retirement during this performance period and will only require normal services until that time.  No depot actions are planned for these two aircraft.  

(c) Engine depot services for the Navy, USAF and NASA of Pratt & Whitney JT8D-9A engines such as scheduled and unscheduled engine shop visits.  Also included is field team support for repairs away from the depot facility. Engine support may also include a small number of T-43A engines for the USAF, as well.

This solicitation will also include limited material management services for the Navy C-9 simulator/trainer located at Colorado Springs, Colorado.  This effort will be negotiated on an as required basis. During the period of performance of this contract, aircraft will be retired (divestiture) and one or more sites may be closed.  The Navy is replacing the C-9s with C-40 aircraft and this may impact on the number of aircraft and has a potential for closure of at least one site.    

The C-9 aircraft is the military version of the commercial DC-9 series aircraft manufactured by McDonnell Douglas Corporation and is an FAA type-certificated DC-9-32F aircraft. Parts and material are commercially available. Manuals and maintenance documentation will be provided to the contractor upon award, however; the contractor must obtain a licensing agreement with the OEM for engineering support. All contractor facilities must be Aircraft Repair Station licensed by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) under Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) Part 145 to participate in this effort. The DRAFT RFP N00019-05-R-0044, along with a draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) and specifications, will be available (late SEP 2005) on the NAVAIR website, at  http://www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations/ .  All Industry Comments should be provided to the Contract Specialist, Jason Lev, via email at jason.lev@navy.mil, within approximately 21 days. The following information is required from offerors who provide any comments:  Organization name and address, primary Point Of Contact (POC), telephone/fax numbers, and e-mail address of the primary POC.  The formal solicitation will incorporate applicable changes resulting from Industry Comments as deemed appropriate by the Government and shall be electronically released approximately November-December 2005 on the NAVAIR website, with proposals due back in mid to late January 2005.  No hard copies of the solicitation or amendments will be provided.  It is the potential offeror’s responsibility to monitor the NAVAIR website for the release of any solicitation and/or amendments.  All correspondence will be via e-mail to the Contract Specialist.  Please note that all prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractors Registration (CCR) database http://www.ccr.gov in order to participate in this procurement.

CAR-L01  NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE SUPPLIERS (OCT 2003) (a) Past performance for this procurement will be evaluated using the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) Program.  RYG is authorized by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Acquisition) for use in the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain, and operate the Fleet. (b) The Government reserves the right to award to the supplier whose quote represents the best value to the Government.  As such, the basis for award will include an evaluation of each supplier’s past performance history for the Federal Supply Class(s) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) of the supplies and services being purchased.  The price to be considered in determining best value will be the evaluated price after application of Technical Evaluation Adjustments (TEAs). (c) The procedures described in the clause entitled "Additional Evaluation Factor for Consideration of Past Performance--Navy Red/Yellow/Green Program (APR 1999)" will be used to a!  ssist in determining the best value for the Government. CAR-M01 ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTOR FOR CONSIDERATION OF PAST PERFORMANCE—NAVY RED/YELLOW/GREEN PROGRAM (APR 1999) (a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) Program, authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain, and operate the Fleet. (b) The purpose of RYG is to assist contracting personnel during source selection to determine the best value for the Government.  The program uses accumulated supplier past performance data to classify each supplier’s performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) as either red (high risk), yellow (moderate risk), green (low risk), or neutral (no risk established).  (c) To assist in source selection, a monetary assessment in the form of a Technical Evaluation Adjustment (TEA) is added to each supplier’s quote having a red or yellow classification !  for the FSC involved.  The dollar amount of the red or yellow TEA assessment is based on the cost to the Government of effecting additional actions required to assure performance by a supplier with an unsatisfactory performance history for the FSC(s) involved.  No TEA is assessed for a supplier having either a green or a neutral FSC RYG classification.  For purposes of the RYG program, a neutral classification is assigned to suppliers who are first time quoters to the Government for the FSC(s) involved, suppliers otherwise having no past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved, and suppliers whose past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved are over three years old.  After consideration of any other pertinent, price-related factors (e.g., transportation charges, first article testing, discount terms), the adjusted price becomes the basis for determining award.  A supplier’s FSC RYG classification may change over time as new or revi!  sed performance data becomes available.  (d) RYG Classifications are s ummarized as follows:  (1) Green is low risk.  No performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  No TEA will be assessed. (2) Yellow is moderate risk.  Additional performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier’s price to reflect the Government’s estimated additional costs. (3) Red is high risk.  Significant additional performance assurance requirements are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier’s price to reflect the Government’s estimated additional costs.  (4) Neutral is no risk established.  No TEA is assessed; nevertheless, additional performance assurance requirements may be considered necessary to assure quality and on-time delivery.  (e) RYG classifications for all applicable FSCs are established monthly for each supplier and provided to them.  Suppliers may address questions about the program or their FSC RYG classifications to the Naval Sea Logistics Center (NLSC) Portsmouth Detachment!  , Federal Building, Room 400, 80 Daniel Street, Portsmouth, NH  0380l-3884, telephone 603-431-9460, ext. 464.  FAX 603-431-9464.  Suppliers may also access their individual FSC RYG classifications through the automated vendor access program.

Offerors may obtain information on CCR registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at www.ccr.gov.

The video/data recorders shall provide for the following capabilities and characteristics: MPEG II (or higher) compression format; three video input capability minimum; built-in two-channel audio; RS-170 or NTSC video input; serial interface for configuration and setup (or equivalent); removable data storage medium; +28 VDC input power; 50 watts max power; mountable in any axis; and not to exceed 10 pounds. The units must be airborne qualified 7 inches wide by 6 inches high by 10 inches deep. The operating environmental capabilities must meet or exceed the full flight envelope of the flight test aircraft in accordance with (IAW) MIL-STD-810F. The environmental requirements include, but are not limited to: temperature of -30 to +70 degrees Celsius; vibration capability IAW MIL-STD-810F method 514.5; shock capability of 40 G minimum, half-sine, 11 msec, three axis; and static load capability of 13.5 G with no permanent deformation, 27 G with no structural failure. The minimum number of MDR80N recorders to be procured is 4; the maximum is 20. The minimum number of 80RMM-SS25 memory cartridges to be procured is 10; the maximum is 50. The minimum number of RMM-IU80 interface adapters is 0; the maximum is 15. The minimum number of MDDS-4 software licenses is 0; the maximum is 20. Delivery of all contract line item numbers (CLINs) will be FOB destination to the Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division China Lake, CA 6 months after receipt of order. Award will be issued under the authority of the test program for commercial items (FAR 13.5). The MDR80N derivative, the Solid State Recorder (SSR), has been selected as the Navy's standard F/A-18 cockpit recording system, replacing the current cockpit video recording system (CVRS) on future production aircraft. The MDR80N is therefore required to maintain commonality between the existing TEAC V-83 recorder systems and the SSR of the production aircraft. The memory cartridges, archiving hardware and software, and data processing procedures for each recording system remain common and compatible with each recorder system. This commonality between test aircraft recorders and fleet aircraft recorders is essential to logistics support, data transfer, processing and training of flight test engineers and aircrew.!   Infrastructure for pilots debrief, data analysis, and secure network distribution is already in place and will be compatible with this equipment. This requirement is limited to TEAC as they are the only source capable of maintaining the necessary commonality and compatibility of equipment. Any firms believing that they can provide the above listed recorder system, clearly showing their ability to do so without compromising the quality, accuracy, and reliability of the data, while achieving the compatibility issues stated above, may submit a written response to be received at the contracting office no later than 28 Oct 05. All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. Award of this contract is expected to be on or about 30 Nov 05. All requests must reference solicitation Number N68936-05-T-0238. Please submit responses in writing to Bryan Gregory by email at bryan.gregory@navy.mil or by mail to Commander Code 210000D, NAVAIR WD, 429 E. Bowen Rd Stop 4015, China Lake CA 93555-6108.

<DESC>USDA-ARS, Parlier is looking to purhase a Critical Point dryer.  This is a commercially available item.  It is an instrument that is used to ready specimens for use in an Scanning Electron Microscope. We have a Hitachi S-3500N SEM.  Requirments for the CDP are as follows.  The system should be able to handle a single large sample (or a large number of small samples) at one time, with a maximum drying time of 3 hours.  System should incorporate an insert that allows for the changing of the chamber to minimize chamber size and allow for fewer samples to be placed in the large chamber at any one time.  Sample holders should be of varying size to allow for more or fewer samples to be processed, depending on the needs of the lab.  The high volume will help to minimize the use of CO2. Minimun of 12 specimen holders with a max capacity of 144 per run.  This will help to maximize throughput.

PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE; PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: The Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Water, Lands, and Environment, Plot 13/15 Parliament Avenue, Century Building, P.O. Box 7096, Kampala, Uganda, Phone: +256-41-230-879, Fax: +256-41-230-891  Jinja-Njeru Public-Private Partnership Water and Wastewater Feasibility Study.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for Jinja-Njeru Public-Private Partnership Water and Wastewater Project.

The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) recently provided a feasibility study grant to the Ministry of Water, Lands, and Environment (MWLE) of Uganda to examine the viability of developing a joint municipal and industrial water and wastewater treatment facility for the Jinja and Njeru municipalities in Uganda.  In Njeru and Jinja, both industrial and municipal polluters lack adequate wastewater treatment facilities.  

Uganda’s National Environmental Management Authority has now passed and is enforcing legislation requiring that industries and the National Water and Sewerage Corporation meet certain discharge standards into sewers and bodies of water.  To meet these standards, this Feasibility Study seeks a “total solution” approach for the Jinja-Njeru region.  By considering a public-private partnership for the region, the goal is to consider whether those companies who will need to build in-plant processes or systems to treat their wastewater discharge can create a joint system that can be utilized by both the industries and the municipalities, utilizing a “polluter pays” principle of financing.  

The study will begin with considering the requirements of the industries, using Nile Breweries as a model, and then adding in municipal and other components.  The study will examine technical, financial, legal, and structural aspects of developing such a partnership under the guidance of the MWLE.  A summary of the Terms of Reference (TOR) is as follows:  

Task I:	   Regulatory and Institutional Feasibility
Task II:   Economic Feasibility
Task III:  Technical Feasibility
Task IV:  Preliminary Environmental Assessment
Task V:   Financial Feasibility
Task VI:  Development Impact
Task VII: Final Report

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $414,128 grant to the Grantee from USTDA.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the TOR, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00PM, November 1, 2005 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

This task order will be issued for an Enterprise License Agreement for licenses and maintenance on a total of 10,619 licenses for the following manufacturer part numbers:  R-RMS-CON-SITE, G-R-W2K-S, G-R-W2K-U, G-R-BVC-W2K-W, G-R-XCHM-RMS, G-R-XCHS-RMS, G-R-BVC-UNIX-S.  The USPTO has already made a significant investment in BindView security products.  Switching to another product is not feasible due to the cost of removing the current software and installing new software as well as the cost of re-training the current staff.  As the manufacturer, only Bindview can provide the Enterprise License Agreement (ELA) method of licensing BindView software.  Based on the above, BindView is uniquely qualified to satisfy the requirement of the USPTO.

1.1.2	The Navy’s objective is to improve common area security at these mission critical sites, increase interoperability between shipyard AACS systems, support shipyard Workflow Management and via a Corporate 1000 Common Proximity Access Card through the appropriate software interfaces and card readers.

1.1.3	This project will further the goals of the Navy’s Shipyard Transformation Plan, signed into action September 9, 2003, to include the application of better Information Technology (IT) systems as part of its mission.

<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), Office of the Clinical Director (OCD), of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), plans to procure clinical neuropsychology services from Dr. Edythe Wiggs, PhD., Great Falls, Virginia 22066. The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541990 and the business size standard is $6M. The Clinical Neuroscience Program, OCD, NINDS requires clinical neuropsychology evaluation of patients for the conduct of intramural research and to provide clinical care to patients participating in intramural studies. Due to currently staffing constraints, OCD, NINDS does not currently have an individual in-house that is capable and qualified to perform these services, therefore, OCD requires an outside licensed Clinical Neuropsychologist. It is essential that NINDS have clinical neuropsychology testing ability. The individual must have the ability and skills to: 1) work in a research setting including participation in procedure selection and protocol preparation; 2) have the ability to customize and design neuropsychological testing to meet the needs of specific NINDS protocols; 3) be familiar with a range of unusual neurological disorders, including those currently under study; 4) generate reports and data into existing research databases; 5) neuropsychological testing including but not limited to standard tests of intelligence, personality, memory and learning for the diagnosis and treatment of adults and children in support of neuropsychological tests suited to the protocol under study in NINDS and the individual being tested, analysis and interpretation of test results and completion of a written report to be filed with the referring physician and in the medical record; and 6) ability to meet requirements for NIH Clinical Center credentials as a licensed Clinical Neuropsychologist. Dr. Wiggs is uniquely qualified to provide these services because of her extensive experience in providing neuropsychological testing, including standard tests of intelligence, personality, memory, and learning. Dr. Wiggs has extensive experience with NIH patients and research protocols, and has specialized knowledge of the performance and interpretation of intraoperative language testing and WADA testing. She has provided these services for the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and NINDS, and is currently involved in several NINDS intramural protocols and is very familiar with this type of work. The period of performance shall be for one year. Dr Edythe Wiggs is the only source known to NINDS that can provide these services. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, including all techniques and demonstrated expertise, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The capability statement and any information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NINDS to determine if the party can fully meet this requirement. Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EDT (local Washington, D.C. time) on September 22, 2005. Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov.  It is the vendor's responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to verify questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award contractors must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).  Please refer to http://orca.bpn.gov in order to register.  In addition, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<CONTACT>Dana Herndon, 301-619-7140
<DESC>The United States Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) intends to award a modification on a sole-source basis to Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, for the completion of leishmania validation studies.  A modification is planned to fund a third lot of leishmania PCR leishmania major beads which is necessary to obtain stability data prior to submission of the 510(K) to FDA in FY06.  The PCR beads will also be used in support of clinical validation studies supporting the 510 (K) application.  A third validation study is needed and is expected to substantiate the customers (the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research) position they intend to submit to the FDA.  To switch to another vendor at this point in the studies would inva lidate the studies completed to date and result in the duplication of costs to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  Cepheid has licensed the intellectual property (IP) necessary to use the leishmania PCR chemistries to be produced and have agreed to take over the responsibilities of the FDA cleared 510(K) application.  Laboratory validation studies to support an application to the FDA have already begun using PCR chemistries produced by Cepheid.  To switch to a new manuf acturer at this point would require all of these validation studies to be repeated.  This would result in mission failure for this project and delay in getting an urgently needed diagnostic assay to the military medical community.  USAMRAA intends to award  this modification under Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  A firm-fixed-price-type modification is planned.  The period of performance will be one month from time of award.  Interested respondents who feel that they are capable of meeting these requireme nts may identify their interest by submitting technical documentation and resumes demonstrating capability to Dana Herndon at FAX No. 301-619-3002 by 3:00 p.m. E.S.T., Thursday, 28 September 2005.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive pro posals.  No telephone requests will be accepted.

Current access information may be obtained by calling 1-877-RAPIDGATE (1-877-727-4342).  (a) Unless the contractor voluntarily participates in the Fast Access Gate Program (see the clause entitled Identification Of Contractor's Employees  Fast Acc ess Gate Program), commercial vehicle access to Fort Lewis will be allowed only at the Logistics Center Gate (Exit 123 from I-5) and through the D St. Commercial Vehicle Inspection Point on North Fort. Both gates are open Monday through Friday, excluding f ederal holidays.  These gates will be open for inbound commercial vehicle access and inspection between 0530 hours and 2100 hours.  These gates may be closed on weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) and federal holidays.  On Saturdays, Sundays, federal holidays , and on other days on which these gates are closed, commercial vehicles must use the Main Gate (Exit 120 from I-5).  Main Gate is open 24 hours per day everyday. A visitor pass must be obtained.  All commercial vehicles will be searched.  The Contractor s hould anticipate delays in getting commercial vehicles on post.  The Contractor must also allow additional time for commercial vehicles to reach their destination by driving through Fort Lewis.  If the commercial vehicle is carrying a load of cement concre te or hot asphalt concrete for delivery, the driver shall notify the gate guard as soon as possible and request that the vehicle be given priority for being searched; however, the Government does not guarantee that the vehicle will be given priority.  On w eekends large vehicles (needing greater than 12Feet-5 inch clearance) will require a time stamped searched label to gain access to North Fort Lewis.  Searched, labels will be issued at the Main Gate, as appropriate.  Drivers needing access to North Fort Le wis must inform the gate guard that their vehicle is over 12 feet-5inchs in height and that they will require access to North Fort Lewis.  The driver will receive a briefing on proper procedures and a searched label.  The Contractor shall ensure that its d rivers, including drivers of subcontractors at any tier, comply with the procedures as explained to them for access to North Fort Lewis.  (b) If the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program, contractor vehicles may enter the installation thr ough any fast access gate lane except at Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta.  During Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta, all contractor vehicles must enter through the Logistics Center gate or, if the Logistics Center Gate is closed, through the Main Gate.  All passengers in the contractor vehicle must have a fast access identification card; otherwise, the contractor vehicle must enter through the Logistics Center Gate or the Main Gate, as appropriate and obtain visitor passes.  Once the Fast Acce ss Gate Program is fully implemented, fast access gate lanes will be at the Main (Liberty) Gate, the 41st Street Gate (North Fort Lewis), the East Gate, the DuPont Gate, the D Street Gate, the Logistics Center Gate, the Madigan Army Medical Center Gate, th e Rainier Gate, the Transmission Line Gate, and the Scouts Out Gate.

(c) I f the Fast Access Gate Program is terminated for any reason, the contractor will be allowed access only through the Logistics Center Gate or the D St. Gate or, when they are closed, the Main Gate unless the contractor is otherwise notified by the Contracti ng Officer.  Local clause 52.111-4132 states:  a.  Each employee who requires access to Fort Lewis to perform work under any contract, at any tier, must obtain either a fast access identification badge or a visitors pass to obtain access to Fort Lewis.  A  fast access identification badge will only be issued to an employee, at any tier, if the employee requires access to Fort Lewis more than twice per week.  Contractor employees, at any tier, who require access to Fort Lewis twice per week or less often or who do not participate in the Fast Access Gate Program shall obtain a visitors pass at the Main (Liberty) Gate or the Logistics Center Gate (or the DuPont Gate when the Logistics Center Gate is closed).  The visitors pass will be issued for a maximum of 30 days at a time.  A fast access identification badge will only be issued to contractor employees if the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program.  The Fast Access Gate Program is a voluntary program.  b.  The contractor shall provide infor mation as required by the Fast Access Gate Program contractor (FAGPC), to enable the FAGPC to conduct a criminal history background check (CHBC) on contractor employees who are to have access to Fort Lewis.  The contractor is responsible for paying the FAG PC any set-up fee and the fee per employee for conducting the CHBC and issuing the fast access identification card.  If the CHBC is not adverse, a fast access identification badge will be issued by the FAGPC to the contractor employee.  If the CHBC is adve rse, the FAGPC is prohibited from issuing a fast access identification badge to the contractor employee.  If a fast access identification badge is denied for any reason, the contractor employee may only enter the installation by obtaining a visitors pass;  however, if the contractor employee does not meet the criteria for being issued a fast access identification badge, the Government may, in its sole discretion, decide not to issue a visitors pass to the contractor employee.  c.  If an employee no longer needs an identification badge for any reason (e.g., quits his/her job or no longer performs work under the contract), the contractor shall return the identification badge to the FAGPC within two (2) calendar days of such change.  If the identification badg e cannot be returned within the required time frame for any reason, the contractor shall immediately notify both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer verbally, followed up in writing the next work day.  An employees inability to obtain entrance to a Gove rnment installation because he/she does not have the required identification badge or visitors pass shall not excuse timely performance of the requirements of this contract.  The FAGPC or the Government may change the location at which identification badg es are issued or returned, with or without advance notice to the contractor.  Any such changes shall not be a basis for adjusting the contract price under any clause of this contract.  d.  Fast access identification badges shall not be reproduced or copied  by the contractor, its subcontractors, or their employees.  If an employees identification badge is lost, stolen, or reproduced, the contractor shall verbally report the loss, theft, or reproduction to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer on the da y such loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered, followed by a written report of the circumstances to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer within one (1) calendar day after the loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered.  e.

The identification badge shall be worn on the upper front of the o uter garment unless precluded by OSHA regulation(s).  The identification badge shall not be used for access to any Government installation except for performance of work under the contract for which it was issued.  f.

The final invoice will not be considered proper for purposes of the Prompt Payment Act (FAR 52.232-25 or FAR 52.212-4(i)) until all identification badges have  been accounted for.  g.  If the Fast Access Gate Program is terminated for any reason, the contractor will be notified by the Contracting Officer as to whether the fast access identification cards will remain valid (and, if so, for how long) and which gat e(s) may be used for access to the installation.

Modified announcement follows:

OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION:  
The National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) is a satellite system used to monitor global environmental conditions, and collect and disseminate data related to: weather, atmosphere, oceans, land and the near-space environment.  The NPOESS Integrated Program Office (IPO) organizationally resides within the Department of Commerce, NOAA National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service (NESDIS).  The Department of Commerce, the Department of Defense, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), created the IPO to develop, acquire, manage, and operate the NPOESS satellites.  Details on NPOESS can be found at http://npoess.noaa.gov.
The NPOESS requirements were developed by the user community and are captured in the NPOESS Integrated Operational Requirements Document (IORD).  To achieve its mission, the IPO has undertaken a far-reaching program of sensor development, and satellite transition and evolution to provide complete coverage of environmental conditions for civil, military, and scientific purposes.  NPOESS data will be processed into Environmental Data Records (EDRs) for use by a number of operational communities.  The IPO’s operational effectiveness depends on its ability to keep pace with rapidly developing technologies.  To accomplish this, the IPO funds research and development initiatives through its Internal Government Studies (IGS) program.
The IGS program consists of teams of scientists and engineers from Government laboratories and centers, Federally-Funded Research and Development Centers, universities, and industry.  These teams are tasked to identify and test technologies and techniques that are able to meet NPOESS requirements and objectives.  The objective of this BAA is to identify and engage research organizations in industry and universities that can make significant technical contributions to NPOESS in the following areas:
•    Un-accommodated Environmental Data Records (EDRs) are remote sensing data products envisioned in the IORD that will not be produced by the NPOESS system (satellite and sensors) currently under development. Reasons for these deficiencies are lack of scientific understanding of the physical processes and measurements to be made, technological immaturity of the potential sensors, or the high cost of sensors using current technology. The IGS program sponsors continuing research directed toward the affordable satisfaction of these IORD requirements 
•    Environmental Data Record performance attainment:  The performance of the NPOESS sensors providing EDRs typically fall between the minimum threshold and desired objective levels of performance described in the IORD.  The IGS program sponsors continuing research into methods, techniques and science needed to advance EDR performance toward objective levels 
•    Data Exploitation and New Product Development:  NPOESS represents a significant advance in the United States’ operational environmental remote sensing capability.  While the system was designed to meet specific application requirements, it is expected that entirely new, novel, and potentially unanticipated useful applications will be discovered.  The IGS program sponsors development of applications to enhance exploitation of existing data products and the development of new data products.
•    Pre-Launch instrument assessment:  The instruments that will be carried on NPOESS and NPOESS Preparatory Project (NPP) spacecraft in many cases have advanced the state of the art in remote sensing technology.  It is critical that the performance of these instruments is completely and reliably characterized prior to launch.  The IGS program endeavors to stimulate vigorous scientific process to insure that this goal is achieved.
•    Post-Launch Calibration and Validation:  The data products generated by the NPOESS program will serve a very wide range of users, from long term climatological studies to operational civil and military forecasting.  The IGS program intends to fund research, development, analysis, and assessment activities to ensure that NPOESS data have been validated with rigor by a broad scientific community. 
•    Truth data development and sustainment:  Successful calibration and validation of NPOESS and NPP data products require various independent truth data sets of phenomena estimated from the raw satellite data.  The IGS program intends to fund activities necessary to ensure that sufficient data are available.  These will include assessment of the quality of existing data sources, research and development of methods, and techniques for data that are uniquely required by the program, and data collection campaigns. 
•    Development of Innovative Technologies that may help to enable the NPOESS mission: These technologies may be used in support of the above areas or to achieve efficiencies in NPOESS ground and space segment systems such as data handling, communications, sensor pointing, precision orbit/attitude determination, power management, etc.

PROGRAM SCOPE: The scope of this program is intentionally broad to address the wide spectrum of issues facing the next generation of polar-orbiting environmental remote sensing satellites.  All research is intended to have the common objective of addressing the technology issues described above.  Strategically, this research will support the establishment of the NPOESS family of environmental remote sensing satellite resources as a valid source for climate and operational environmental monitoring and forecasting in the future.
EVALUATION CRITERIA: Proposals will be evaluated using the following criteria in descending order of importance: (1) Capabilities and experience of the offeror, specifically with technology directly related to NPOESS,  (2) Contributions/ Relevance to the NPOESS Mission, (3) Plans and Capabilities to Accomplish Technology Transfer from a research environment to the NPOESS program , and (4) Total Cost and Cost Reasonableness.  All awards made in response to this BAA will be subject to availability of Government funds. Contract award(s) will be made on the basis of the evaluation criteria listed above to the offeror(s) whose proposals are considered most advantageous to the NPOESS IPO. 
GENERAL INFORMATION: IPO budgets approximately $8M per year for IGS contracts. IPO intends to award multiple IDIQ task order contracts ranging in value from $100K to $5M with one base year and up to four (4) option years (total of 5 years). Offerors should prepare proposals that anticipate an initial task order with a period of performance not longer than 12 months valued under $1M. This BAA will remain open for a period of one year. The selection process may begin as early as August 15, 2005.
Offerors must submit an original proposal and five (5) copies with a minimum of five (5) pages not to exceed ten (10) pages in length consisting of both technical and cost proposals to the administrative address for this BAA.  It is the policy of IPO to treat all proposals as competitive information and to disclose the contents only for the purposes of evaluation.  Non-Government personnel may be used for evaluation support.  Any such non-Government personnel are required to sign non-disclosure statements prior to participating in the evaluation. By submission of a proposal in response to this announcement, the offeror gives its written permission that its proposal information may be disclosed to those selected non-Government personnel for the evaluation of its proposal. 
Only Government evaluators will make selections under this BAA. This announcement constitutes the Broad Area Announcement as contemplated by FAR 35.016.  A formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement will not be issued. Requests for same will be disregarded. The Government reserves the right to select for award any, all, part, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement. Awards are subject to the provisions of the FAR Subpart 9.5, Organizational Conflict of Interest. All offerors and proposed subcontractors must affirmatively state whether they are supporting any other IPO contracts through an active contract or subcontract. All affirmations must state which office(s) the offeror supports, and identify the prime contract number. Affirmation shall be furnished at the time of proposal submission. All facts relevant to the existence or potential existence of organizational conflicts of interest, as that term is defined in the FAR 9.501, must be disclosed. The disclosure shall include a description of the action the offeror has taken, or proposes to take, to avoid, neutralize or mitigate such conflict. This BAA is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to pay any pre-proposal or proposal preparation costs. All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit proposals, which will be evaluated. Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Institutions (MI) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals. However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research related to environmental remote sensing developments.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 561410   The purpose of amendment 3 to RFQ-DC-05-00400 is to provide answers to additional questions. 1.  Is there a style manual or where can the IPCC national communication guidelines be found? The IPCC national communication guidelines for what is to be included in the  document can be found on pages 80-101 of the document at the following website:  http://maindb.unfcc.int/library/?screen=list&language=en&TRC1=ON&FLD1=dC&VAL1=FCCC/cp/1999/7&OPR1=contains&mode=wim 2. How many rounds of edits to the Word draft will be required? Because the schedule is somewhat in  flux right not it is difficult to predict.  EPA planned on agency staff who are authoring chapters and working on the document doing some of the early edits. Therefore, the vendor would most likely be expected to do one or two edits to clean up any problems missed by agency staff.  3.  How many  rounds of edits to the laid-out document will be required? At most two, possible only one, in that agency staff will also be involved in this.  4.  How many graphs, charts, maps, and other graphics will need to be produced? Many will be produced by agency chapter leads.  Our estimate is that  about fifty (50) graphics would be needed.  It is difficult to tell exactly at this point since we are still in the first draft stage. 5.  Will EPA provide all of the photographs? If not, will EPA want the contractor to purchase professional digital photos? EPA and other agencies will acquire  photos. There is only a remote chance that the vendor would be requested to purchase any photos.  6.  Task 2 requires output in both Word and PDF. However, looking at the Climate Action Report - 2002, it was originally produced using QuarkXpress and then output to a PDF.  Will the vendor be able  to use high-end software to produce a high-quality PDF as long as the report is also delivered in Word? The vendor can use whatever graphics package they would like as long as they produce a final PDF file that can be submitted to the UN, can be loaded onto a website and printed.  The input files  used by the vendor would be in Word format and should be edited (prior to final production) using Word.

Technical POC/Program Manager, Mr. David E. Krzysiak, AFRL/IFGA, 525 Brooks Rd, Rome, NY, 13441-4505, telephone: (315) 330-7454, email: David.Krzysiak@rl.af.mil.  Contracting POC: AFRL/IFKA, Lori L. Smith, Contracting Officer, 26 Electronic Parkway, NY 13441-4514, telephone: (315) 330-1955, email: Lori.Smith@rl.af.mil. AFRL Rome Research Site is soliciting white papers for concept developments, experiments, and demonstrations involving new and innovative approaches to support future Air Force networking, services, and information assurance requirements in the context of a Global Information Grid (GIG). The GIG is a globally interconnected, interoperable, and secure system of systems for collecting, processing, storing, disseminating, and managing information on demand to warfighters, policy makers, and support personnel. Leveraging commercial technologies and the potential for dual use by both the military and civilian communities are two additional aspects of this program. This activity is aimed at addressing the scale and complexity of a GIG which will provide new, end-user, multimedia, information services and support, distributed   command & control, intelligence, telemedicine and similar applications. These services and applications are vital to the Air Force mission to deploy and sustain forces anywhere in the world. To this end, the ability to send a wide variety of data across a global network comprised of communications channels of varying characteristics, in a secure, survivable manner, is of prime importance. An underlying assumption is that DOD communications will be derived from the commercial, national, and international fiber optic cable infrastructure. However, to reach deployed or airborne units, wireless extension of that infrastructure is necessary. Both terrestrial and satellite transmission systems will be required to support this extension capability and will also be inherent components of these deployed networks. In both instances, they will be required to support large amounts of information throughput. Candidate areas of technical research in support of communications networking, services, and information assurance technology for a GIG are: 1) Implementation and novel Extension of High Speed Large Scale Networks:  Effective implementation of networks to support a deployed Joint Forces Air Component Command and below. Efforts should address areas related to security and authentication, survivability and dependability, traffic management and traffic flow control, network management in a virtual network environment, mobile nodes and networks, self reconfiguring, and dynamic routing. Technologies to support network management will provide global management of the entire information infrastructure. Future management systems must provide for this overall management capability. This infrastructure includes numerous resources such as communications equipment, network switching equipment, distributed operating systems, and user applications. Encouraged are new and innovative ideas in management systems technologies including    visualization techniques, network emulation, artificial intelligence, and any other appropriate technology. Also encouraged is technology to provide specific management techniques for heterogeneous network environments, as well as cooperating management entities. Effective extension of network technology developments to provide launch points from high speed networks into highly constrained deployed networks.
2) Interoperability: For interoperability of an increasingly diverse set of transmission systems, work is encouraged but not limited to; development and demonstration of theater (deployed) fiber optic and high bandwidth RF (including satellite links) networking technology for high bandwidth communications between multi-media display systems that provide an interactive, common picture of battlespace to Theater and Component Commanders. The network should be scaleable, modular, survivable, secure, and provide for interoperability with global commercial communications infrastructure. Examples of enhancing the bandwidth capacity are: Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM), ultra short pulse Time Division Multiplexing (TDM), Optical Code Division Multiplexing (OCDMA) and a hybrid of such schemes. Examples of devices are: integrated transmitters and receivers, amplifiers, switches (SONET, ATM, Packet), synchronizers, frequency translators, filters, and routers. 3) User Network Services: The goal is to formulate innovative ideas for user services which use high bandwidth global networks, low bandwidth battlesite networks, airborne segments, and combinations of the these, experiment with them, and possibly develop promising ideas into demonstrable prototypes. Future services will provide the capability for day-to-day mission planning/execution in a distributed C2 coalition environment and assist commanders in making critical decisions in heavy stress situations. Past work in this area has centered around interactive, interpersonal communications services (workstation video windows, video conferencing, shared workplace graphics, multimedia presentation, multimedia conferencing, imagery dissemination) that provide the capability of collaboration among distributed users, both fixed and mobile. Also encouraged are new and innovative ideas for communications services which will support emerging technologies such as visualization and distributed virtual reality, and technologies which support new and innovative communications services such as data compression techniques or others. Also encouraged is work addressing the psychology of individuals and groups in the decision making process in distributed military C2 and the definition of new communications services which support that process. 4) Ultra-wide- bandwidth, multi-channeled, air and space-based communications networks on and between platforms:  Efforts should develop and define optical/electronic network architecture, system and subsystem (transmitter, receiver, switch, optical mux and demux, optical amplifiers, etc.) requirements for multi gigabit per second optical/electronic networks on-board air and space platforms and other AF/DOD applications.  Design and develop passive and active optical/electronic chip scale networking components (transmitters, receivers, switches) for Wave-length Division Multiplexing, RF, Code Division Multiple Access, etc. communications. Implement photonics modules for optical/electronic networking architectures utilizing Integrated Optical Circuits (IOCs) in hybrid and monolithic format.
5) Network Modeling and Simulation: Efforts should research and develop modeling and simulation tools that are trustworthy to predict, with known and characterizable accuracy, network behavior over a broad range of time scales, network sizes and technology composition.  This solicitation also seeks research on appropriate online network measurement methodologies, which in conjunction with modeling and simulation tools will provide the basis for online network analysis and control.   Deliverables should include technical reports, and when appropriate, software and/or advanced technology demonstrations.

I.  FUNDING	OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:

Objective: The overall objective of this BAA is to design, develop and demonstrate a capability for continuous effects based assessment in a dynamic tasking environment.  This program will employ, exploit and develop as necessary technologies to provide early demonstrations and potential transitions to operational units.  It will also enhance existing and maturing technologies and provide for spiral development and interaction with other ongoing Air Force programs.  Familiarity with  initiatives that are focused on dynamic tasking and effects based assessment, as well as those technologies that are necessary to support these functions (e.g. multi-INT fusion) are desirable.  Specific efforts targeted for collaboration include: 1. the Command and Control Battle Lab’s T-BONE  effort which is focused on rewriting the Theater Air Planning (TAP) capability and the Air Operations Database (AODB).  2. The U.S. Air Force Effects Based Assessment Task Force initiative. 3. DARPA’s JAGUAR (Joint Air-Ground Unified Adaptive Re-planning) program.  4. AFRL’s PANACIA (Predictive Awareness and Network-Centric Analysis for Collaborative Intel Assessment).  And 5. AFRL/HE’s AOC Strategy Planning and Operational Effects Assessment Visualization Effort (04-01-HE-04).   In addition to direct technology developments this program will support other complimentary activities including test and evaluation, modeling and simulation, and data collection and management.

Background: The current planning process for air operations takes commander’s intent and turns it into orders that executing units carry out. Mission data and orders are documented and sent to executing units in a batch-oriented Air Tasking Order (ATO). To counter emerging threats or exploit emerging opportunities, commanders require the means of reacting very quickly. This argues against a batch-oriented process and towards a more continuous process.  In the near future, executing orders might be available in a Dynamic Air/Space Execution Order (DAEO) or in a continuous “streaming ATO”.  This envisions a largely continuous process where target queues are dynamically executed as they are built.  Crucial to a DAEO or streaming ATO process is the ability to conduct effects based assessment (EBA).  Assessment activities need to begin well before tasks are executed. During the planning process, assessment requirements are an integral part of the DAEO generation. During execution, assessment activities need to determine the likelihood that the course of action will attain commander’s intent. The focus of combat assessment today is on actions rather than effects and results in recommendations concerning re-attacks.  In addition to re-attack recommendations, effects based assessment must look at whether the basic strategy of the campaign or major operation should be changed.  This Critical Experiment will result in a capability for achieving effects-based assessment in a dynamic tasking environment.  New processes for effects-based assessment will be developed and evaluated under this initiative.  Technologies to support accurate and timely EBA based on the new processes will be developed.  Effects based assessment methods for a streaming ATO need to be developed.  Both quantitative and qualitative methods for reasoning under uncertainty in a dynamic environment should be explored.  Note, this effort is focused on exploiting multi-INT fusion capabilities, not developing them.

<DESC>This announcement is to notify the cancellation of Solicitation Number (Reference No.) F2C3XG5188A100, requesting freestanding furniture, chairs, and lockers effective immediately.  

This requirement will be awarded as a sole source/brand name to Contract Furnishers of Hawaii, Inc., (DBA Office Pavilion) for Herman Miller freestanding furniture, Via chairs, Equipto lockers and installation under the authority of FAR 6.302.

This requirement is for an additional phase of a furniture purchase and installation project for the C-17 program to purchase freestanding furniture, chairs, and lockers.  Currently, the C-17 program is in the process of having over $1.3M worth of Herman Miller, Via and Equipto furniture/items and appliances installed in its three new buildings.  The previous requirement was procured through full and open competition and awarded to Contract Furnishers of Hawaii, Inc., for Herman Miller, Via and Equipto brand furnitures.  Since the items are peculiar to Herman Miller, Via and Equipto, any deviation from these furniture/chair/locker manufacturers will negatively impact the mission when reconfigurations are necessary.  Issues with configurations, compatibility, functionality, structure, finish and colors will arise which would not be cost effective for the Government and negatively impact the mission.  It is anticipated that no other furniture manufacturer will meet the Government’s requirements of functionality and compatibility with the existing Herman Miller, Via and Equipto furniture.

In addition to requiring Herman Miller furniture, Via chairs, and Equipto lockers, the Government has determined that Contract Furnishers of Hawaii, Inc. is the logical follow-on contractor to complete the project because it is the only authorized dealer of Herman Miller furniture in the state of Hawaii.  Also, Contract Furnishers of Hawaii, Inc. is familiar with the layout of the offices and requirements for the first phase of the C-17 program’s installation.  Therefore, having them perform the additional phase of the installation would provide a single furniture point of contact for the coordination and movement of Government personnel between each of the phases.  This continuity of effort would provide for a successful move of personnel to their new office spaces and limit the use of Government resources in the form of down time.

In order to assess this application, participants must first go to the AAAP website (at: http://aaap.ncr.gsa.gov) and select the "Register to offer space" link.  Please complete the online registration and the Government will notify you by email once a Solicitation for Offers (SFO) is posted to this website.  When you receive this email notification, you can submit your online offer using AAAP.

Offers can typically submit offers beginning with the 1st day of the open period every month through the last day of the open period every month.  Typically, the last day of the open period will be the 7th day of every month.  (The official opening time and closing time for each offer period will be established on the AAAP website at aaap.ncr.gsa.gov.))

The United States Government is seeking to lease, in increments of up to 100,000 BOMA Rentable Square Feet of office and related space yielding up to 90,000 ANSI/BOMA Office Area Square Feet to satisfy new requirements and compete existing leases for potential replacement.

The Government will relocate from existing space under lease if economics involved and other factors prove to be favorable.  The cost of moving, telecommunications, alterations, impact on agency mission and other variables to be determined by the Government, will be considered in the relocation decision in order to determine the best value to the Government.  The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards and/or combine multiple space requirements.  OCCUPANCY:  Space must be ready for commencement of tenant alterations during Summer 2005 through Summer 2006.

The following clauses are added in full text:          52.111-4131 COMMERCIAL VEHICLE ACCESS TO FORT LEWIS  FAST ACCESS GATE         PROGRAM  Procedures for commercial vehicle access to Fort Lewis are subject to change without prior notice.  Current access information may be obtained by calling 1-877-RAPIDGATE (1-877-727-4342). (a) Unless the contractor voluntarily participates in the Fast Access Gate Program (see the clause entitled Identification Of Contractor's Employees  Fast Access Gate Program), commercial vehicle access to Fort Lewis will be allowed only at the Logistics Center Gate (Exit 123 from I-5) and through the D St. Commercial Vehicle Inspection Point on North Fort. Both gates are open Monday through Friday, excluding federal holidays.  These gates will be open for inbound commercial vehicle access and inspection b etween 0530 hours and 2100 hours.  These gates may be closed on weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) and federal holidays.  On Saturdays, Sundays, federal holidays, and on other days on which these gates are closed, commercial vehicles must use the Main Gate ( Exit 120 from I-5).  Main Gate is open 24 hours per day everyday. A visitor pass must be obtained.  All commercial vehicles will be searched.  The Contractor should anticipate delays in getting commercial vehicles on post.  The Contractor must also allow a dditional time for commercial vehicles to reach their destination by driving through Fort Lewis.   If the commercial vehicle is carrying a load of cement concrete or hot asphalt concrete for delivery, the driver shall notify the gate guard as soon as possible and request that the vehicle be given priority for being searched; however, the Government does  not guarantee that the vehicle will be given priority. On weekends large vehicles (needing greater than 12 feet - 5 inches clearance) will require a time stamped SEARCHED label to gain access to North Fort Lewis.  SEARCHED  labels will be issued at the Main Gate, as appropriate.  Drivers needing access to Nort h Fort Lewis must inform the gate guard that their vehicle is over 12 feet - 5 inches in height and that they will require access to North Fort Lewis. The driver will receive a briefing on proper procedures and a SEARCHED label.  The Contractor shall ensur e that its drivers, including drivers of subcontractors at any tier, comply with the procedures as explained to them for access to North Fort Lewis. (b) If the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program, contractor vehicles may enter the installation through any fast access gate lane except at Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta.  During Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta, all con tractor vehicles must enter through the Logistics Center gate or, if the Logistics Center Gate is closed, through the Main Gate.  All passengers in the contractor vehicle must have a fast access identification card; otherwise, the contractor vehicle must e nter through the Logistics Center Gate or the Main Gate, as appropriate and obtain visitor passes.      Once the Fast Access Gate Program is fully implemented, fast access gate lanes will be at the Main (Liberty) Gate, the 41st Street Gate (North Fort Lewis), the East Gate, the DuPont Gate, the D Street Gate, the Logistics Center Gate, the Madigan Army Medic al Center Gate, the Rainier Gate, the Transmission Line Gate, and the Scouts Out Gate.  The contractor shall use only those lanes specifically marked as fast access lanes.     (c) If the Fast Access Gate Program is terminated for any reason, the contractor will be allowed access only through the Logistics Center Gate or the D St. Gate or, when they are closed, the Main Gate unless the contractor is otherwise notified by the Contracting Off icer.     (End of clause)  52.111-4132  IDENTIFICATION OF CONTRACTORS EMPLOYEES  FAST ACCESS GATE          PROGRAM a.  Each employee who requires access to Fort Lewis to perform work under any contract, at any tier, must obtain either a fast access identification badge or a visitors pass to obtain access to Fort Lewis.  A fast access identification badge will only be issued to an employee, at any tier, if the employee requires access to Fort Lewis more than twice per week.  Contractor employees, at any tier, who require access to Fort Lewis twice per week or less often or who do not participate in the Fast Access Gate Program shall obtain a visitors pass at the Main (Liberty) Gate or the Logistics Center Gate (or the DuPont Gate when the Logistics Center Gate is closed).  The visitors pass will be issued for a maximum of 30 days at a time.  A fast access identificatio n badge will only be issued to contractor employees if the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program.  The Fast Access Gate Program is a voluntary program.   b.  The contractor shall provide information as required by the Fast Access Gate Program contractor (FAGPC), to enable the FAGPC to conduct a criminal history background check (CHBC) on contractor employees who are to have access to Fort Lewis.  The contra ctor is responsible for paying the FAGPC any set-up fee and the fee per employee for conducting the CHBC and issuing the fast access identification card.  If the CHBC is not adverse, a fast access identification badge will be issued by the FAGPC to the con tractor employee.  If the CHBC is adverse, the FAGPC is prohibited from issuing a fast access identification badge to the contractor employee.  If a fast access identification badge is denied for any reason, the contractor employee may only enter the insta llation by obtaining a visitors pass; however, if the contractor employee does not meet the criteria for being issued a fast access identification badge, the Government may, in its sole discretion, decide not to issue a visitors pass to the contractor em ployee.      c.  If an employee no longer needs an identification badge for any reason (e.g., quits his/her job or no longer performs work under the contract), the contractor shall return the identification badge to the FAGPC within two (2) calendar days of such change .  If the identification badge cannot be returned within the required time frame for any reason, the contractor shall immediately notify both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer verbally, followed up in writing the next work day.  An employees inability  to obtain entrance to a Government installation because he/she does not have the required identification badge or visitors pass shall not excuse timely performance of the requirements of this contract.  The FAGPC or the Government may change the location  at which identification badges are issued or returned, with or without advance notice to the contractor.  Any such changes shall not be a basis for adjusting the contract price under any clause of this contract.  d.  Fast access identification badges shall not be reproduced or copied by the contractor, its subcontractors, or their employees.  If an employees identification badge is lost, stolen, or reproduced, the contractor shall verbally report the loss, theft, or reproduction to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer on the day such loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered, followed by a written report of the circumstances to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer within one (1) calendar day after the loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered. e.  Each contractor employee shall wear the fast access identification badge while performing work under the contract.  The identification badge shall be worn on the upper front of the outer garment unless precluded by OSHA regulation(s).  The identification badge shall not be used for access to any Government installation except f or performance of work under the contract for which it was issued.   f.  The contractor shall, upon expiration or termination of the contract, collect all identification badges and turn them in to the FAGPC. The final invoice will not be considered proper for purposes of the Prompt Payment Act (FAR 52.232-25 or FAR 52.212-4 (i)) until all identification badges have been accounted for. g.  If the Fast Access Gate Program is terminated for any reason, the contractor will be notified by the Contracting Officer as to whether the fast access identification cards will remain valid (and, if so, for how long) and which gate(s) may be used for a ccess to the installation.   (End of clause)  52.111-4133	COMMERCIAL VEHICLE ACCESS TO FORT LEWIS  Procedures for commercial vehicle access to Fort Lewis are subject to change without prior notice.

The solicitation document and incorporated provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-05.

<DESC>The 7th Bomb Wing established the Commander’s Operational Picture (COP) office with the specific guidance to implement the policies, guide strategic planning, acquisition, and integration of the COP system into an operational environment. One of the major tenets of this framework is the management of information and knowledge. The 7th Bomb Wing (7 BW) COP Office has directed the 7th Communications Squadron to take control of the COP and Dyess Decision Support Tool Set (DSTS) processes within Dyess AFB. As the 7 CS is not manned with an Air Force web programmer/database administrator to accomplish the task, contractor support is required.

The Statement of Work covers planning, implementation planning and support tasks associated with maintaining effective COP/DSTS policy, organizational structure, and associated mechanisms and processes on behalf of the 7th Communications Squadron.  Initially, work will be focused on COP/DSTS:  its conceptual design, sustainment and maintenance, maturation, and integration support for the 7th Bomb Wing Commander’s Operational Picture and Dyess Decision Support Tool Set.  Tasks include supporting the operation and maintenance of the COP/DSTS, resources, integrating other 7 BW COP/DSTS identified web-based and non-web-based tools, and providing strategic/tactical COP/DSTS master planning schedule development and maintenance. Integral to the COP/DSTS effort is the technical and analytic support required to maintain and improve 7 BW COP/DSTS architecture, system design, system development, programming, training, and server administration.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to award a sole source purchase order to the American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD) located at 1629 K Street NW, Suite 503, Washington, DC 20006-1634 to provide consultative services to assess the Disability Mentoring Day program, which is officially commemorated on the third Wednesday of every October.  Originating with the White House in 1999, this large-scale, broad-based effort was designed to promote career development for students and other job seekers with disabilities through hands-on career exploration, job shadowing, internship or employment opportunities, and matching of mentee/mentor relationships.  
SSA will procure the expert services of a contractor who is familiar with SSA’s target population and can provide the personnel, materials, services, and equipment necessary to assure the success of Disability Mentoring Day activities.  It is SSA’s belief that AAPD is the only source qualified to meet our needs, and is uniquely qualified because of its extensive experience in educating businesses and the general public about disability issues.  AAPD has partnerships with other Federal Agencies to promote the economic and political empowerment of all children and adults with disabilities, educate businesses and the general public about disability issues.  This notice is for informational purposes only and is neither a request for quotation nor an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation.  Interested parties that believe they are capable of providing these services can submit a capability statement to John T. Andrews, Jr. via e-mail at john.t.andrews@ssa.gov no later than 4:30 p.m. EST, September 15, 2005.  The Government will consider all information from responsible sources, but a determination by the Government not to compete this action is solely at the discretion of the Government.

<CONTACT>Katherine Holcomb, Contract Specialist, Phone 407-380-4316, Fax 407-380-4164, Email Katherine.Holcomb@navy.mil
<DESC>On behalf of the Sea Warrior Information Technology (IT) Program Management Office, the Naval Air Warfare Center Training System Division has a requirement to purchase a commercially available Skills Management System (SMS) software application suite with operation, maintenance, analysis, training, and technical support services in support of Navy, DoD and potentially other Federal agencies.  The Contractor will be required to provide a suite of commercially available web-based tools and corresponding technical services for the collection, validation, analysis, and management, and maintenance of skill and task data for both occupational and non-occupational work in accordance with nationally accepted methods for occupational analysis and standards development.  The processes and methods used by the tools shall be based on accepted industrial/organizational psychology to collect reliable and validated data; utilize principles of human behavior to categorize job behaviors; utilize well-defined taxonomies to identify and quantify knowledge, skills, abilities, and tools required for work; utilize science of survey population sampling, survey design, and survey delivery; adhere to legal requirements regarding employment discrimination and legally defensible occupational data; be based on and compatible with the Department of Labor’s O*NET directory of occupational descriptions.
The tools shall utilize a pre-existing library of Navy and DOL occupational competency descriptions to simplify the process.  The processes and methods used by the vendor shall support a multifaceted collection of work, worker and workplace data content requirements in a specific environment or set of environments, that will be used to support Navy business processes of skills and competency capture, competency to position mapping, use of dynamic incentives, job selection and learning choice.
The processes and methods used by the vendor must allow the Navy to define every position and job at a level of granularity that connects the skill sets to supporting training events and performance requirements that fully articulate all work and workplace requirements attached to the job and position. The process and tools shall support and integrate the Navy’s requirement for three levels of data collection (Level I, Level II, and Level III).  Level I data shall provide sufficient detail to develop occupational standards.  Level II data shall provide sufficient detail to assess performance and provide training at the task level.  Level III shall provide sufficient detail to support the development and assessment of the human’s role in a system design.  All three levels shall be linked to the other two in order to facilitate the sharing of information between manpower, personnel, training, and acquisition communities.  The tools and processes must support the Total Force—active, reserve, civil service, and contractors to permit common definition of work, worker and workplace requirements that will allow skill-based detailing and work assignment that is not restricted to rank, rate, or Navy Enlisted Code (NEC).  The resulting information must be evaluated in such a way as to support accurate placement of the individual in a job, as well as career growth opportunities that will prepare the individual for the next assignment.
The Navy intends to procure perpetual licenses for the tools, with rights to use and modify the source code for purposes of simplifying the user interface and integration into the Navy’s Manpower, Personnel, and Training and Education IT Systems.  The tools will be used by Navy and contractor personnel to develop occupational standards, define work, worker and workplace information in a manner that permits assessment of skill gaps, development of learning strategies, skills development, and measure performance for both military and civilian personnel.
The Contractor will be required to provide user training and certification for the employment of the tools and processes provided to the Navy to include certification of Navy Manpower, Personnel, and Learning Center staffs, and maintain a help desk to assist users with technical issues.
The Contractor will be required to provide skill analysts certified in the use of tools and processes to assist the Navy with its ongoing data capture efforts of various job categories including Level I, Level II, and Level III; enlisted, officer, reserves, and civilian; primary and collateral duties; critical work functions; and recruit, apprentice, journeyman, and master.  The contractor shall provide analysts to assist in defining, collecting, and maintaining Human Capital Objects; establishing knowledge, skills, abilities and tools (KSAT) data and performance statements; linking training events and content to tasks; exploring the capture and use of skill data in a team environment; and performing manpower, personnel, and training analysis.
The Contractor will be required to provide technical support to respond to SMS user issues and questions; manage configuration of SMS data in accordance with Navy approved Configuration Management Plans; revise the Skills Management System to address revised data needs for the Navy’s training community; assist in the development and modification of Navy applications and services that utilize SMS data; assist in the development and standardization of SMS related business processes, data and report formats; assist with the establishment and implementation of processes for analyzing captured skill information, utilizing skill information in a training environment, utilizing and creating skill information during system design and development process, measuring Sailor performance; and assist at conferences and meetings where in-depth knowledge of SMS process, methods, applications, data models, and logical models are required.
Since 2001, the Navy has utilized tools, processes and methodology, and personnel from SkillsNET Corporation.  The Navy’s requirement for job task analysis methodology was and remains:  a) an automated on line product suite encompassing occupational and training analyses and the most up-to-date taxonomy for describing work similar to the Department of Labor, the Department of Education, and several State Governments, since there is commonality between occupational and training requirements identified in those segments when compared to Navy requirements, thereby saving considerable time and effort for the Navy’s Revolution in Training;  b)  a system that utilizes job incumbents (not outside job analyst observers) via the Internet to develop and validate the tasks, knowledge, skills, ability, and tools, in a job-specific company/industry, thereby using an Internet-based job analysis system which allows multiple subject-matter experts access to the system at least 18 hours per day, 7 days a week; c) an occupational science-based system to cluster valid tasks into small clusters of tasks, skills, abilities, tools and specialized knowledge requirements by critical job function; d) a system that provides a starter library of key occupations that have been developed in one or more state education or Workforce Improvement Act environment; and  e) an automated on-line product that meets the legislative, judicial and executive order standards required in determining manpower, training and occupational requirements.  The Skills Management System (SMS) software application suite shall embed the DOL O*Net common language descriptors for skills and abilities and provide a valid framework to define unique tasks, tools, and knowledge requirements to perform the Navy’ critical work functions.
The Navy has made a substantial investment in training personnel in the use of SkillsNET tools and processes, analyzing its workforce, and developing web services that utilize the resulting data.  Contractors interested in providing the before mentioned products, licenses, and services will be required to utilize the existing Skills Management System data, modify existing Navy web services, and provide a cost estimate for modifications to all system interfaces that utilize data from the SMS as necessary to accommodate any differences between Navy’s current SMS and vendor’s proposed SMS, and provide refresher training to trained workforce who interface with the SMS to address changes from current SMS and vendor’s proposed SMS.
Contractors capable of accomplishing the required products and services are invited to submit literature, brochures, and/or capabilities summaries, that as a minimum, identify current commercially available products and company capabilities; identify business size and past (limit to within 3 years) and current performance on similar contracts (include dollar value, complexity and point of contact); identify business type (i.e., large business, small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a) certified business, woman-owned business, etc); provide rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost and schedule to tailor vendor’s products to Navy’s requirements; identify vendor’s proposed SMS data structures and how existing Skills Management System data will be utilized, including ROM cost and schedule to migrate existing data; address anticipated impacts to other existing Navy applications and services that utilize data from the SMS including cost and schedule to implement any required modifications; and address impact to trained workforce who interface with the SMS including ROM cost and schedule for any required refresher training.  Please limit any extraneous information.  Information should be sent via e-mail to katherine.holcomb@navy.mil.  Alternative submittal methods are via facsimile to (407) 380-4164 Attn: K. Holcomb or by mail to:  NAVAIR Orlando Training Systems Division, ATTN:  Code 2.5.3.3 (K. Holcomb), 12350 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826-3275.  Responses required by 29 Sep 2005.  Questions concerning this requirement should be directed in writing to the Contract Specialist, Katherine Holcomb, via email at katherine.holcomb@navy.mil.
The submission of this information is for PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to procure any products or services, or for the Government to pay for the information received.  No solicitation document exists at this time.

<DESC>TACOM-RI is seeking interested sources for a potential requirement of approximately 250 to 400 each of the M2A2 Aiming Circle (Complete) and approximately 300 to 400 each of the M2A2 Aiming Circle (Head Assembly). M2A2 Aiming Circle (Head Assembly) The Aiming Circle consists of an elbow telescope mounted on orienting and elevating mechanisms which are contained within a main housing.  The main housing, in turn, is mounted on a tripod and provides precise measurements of azimuth and elevation angles o f a ground or aerial target through the use of azimuth and elevation scales.  The telescope is a low power, fixed focus instrument.  The elbow bend in the telescope makes it easier for the operator to use.  A mounting mechanism provides the elbow telescope  with unlimited azimuth movements and limited elevation movements.  The aiming circle can be used to shoot the sun for general topographical surveying.  An integral magnetic compass is used to orient the aiming circle to magnetic north, therefore the entir e construction of the aiming circle must be non-magnetic.  The Aiming Circle can also be oriented using stars with a reticle inside the elbow telescope.  The aiming circle mounts on the tripod head with leveling screws and level indicating vials.  The aimi ng circle consists of cast and precision machined components.  Two precision matched worms and wheels are also incorporated for azimuth and elevation movement.  The aiming circle is roughly 10 inches high by 6 inches in diameter.  An aluminum dome cover is  provided with two latches and a webbed carrying strap for ease of transport and protection.

<SUBJECT>65 -- PharmAssist Extended Warranty
<DESC>Notice of Intent to award a Sole Source Procurement. The Government intends to issue a sole source purchase order for the purchase of an extended waranty for the PharmAssist computer programs used at the Buckley AFB pharmacy in accordance with FAR Part 12 Regulations, Acquisition of Commercial Items.  The potential award will go to Innovation Associates 627 Field Street Johnson NY  13790.  This requirement is considered sole source given that Innovation Associates is the only known company that manufactures the hardware and software updates that is compatible with our currently installed PC workstations. The PharmAssist system is in operation at Buckley and is our sole dispensing prescription system. It has become the standard prescription filling system throughout Air Force pharmacies and is currently being taught in the Air Force’s technical schools. The 460th Contracting Squadron intends to award a purchase order by other than full and open competition in accordance with FAR Subpart 6.302-1 (a)(2)(ii). Only one responsible source is known and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. Questions should be directed to A1C Heather Pelley, Contracting Specialist, in writing via email: heather.pelley@buckley.af.mil, (720) 847-7427 or to SSgt Marcus Adams, Contracting Officer, via email: marcus.adams@buckley.af.mil, telephone (720) 847-6964; or by facsimile: (720) 847-6443.

<SUBJECT>J -- Notice of Intent to Sole Source Award - Civil Engineering, Information Management, and Transportation Services (CEITS)
<DESC>The Government intends to issue a one-month sole source purchase order (1-31 Oct 05) for Civil Engineering, Information Management, and Transportation Services (CEITS) at Buckley AFB, CO in accordance with FAR Part 12 Regulations, Acquisition of Commercial Items.  The potential award will go to TekStar, LLC, 5540 Tech Center Dr., Suite 200, Colorado Springs, CO 80919.  TekStar, who is the contractor on the current contract (set to expire 30 Sep 05), is uniquely positioned to provide continuing services for this short time period.  Furthermore, due to the breadth and complexity of the tasks required under this contract, the projected time for a potential contractor to phase-in (given security requirements, mobilization, etc.), and the short timeline to award, the government has determined that this situation justifies sole source consideration. The 460th Contracting Squadron intends to award a purchase order by other than full and open competition in accordance with FAR Subpart 6.302-1 (a)(2)(iii)(B). Only one responsible source is known and award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency’s requirements.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. Questions should be directed to 1Lt James Simmons, Contract Specialist, via email:  james.simmons@buckley.af.mil, telephone (720) 847-6975 or to SSgt Marcus Adams, Contracting Officer, via email: marcus.adams@buckley.af.mil, telephone (720) 847-6964; or by facsimile: (720) 847-6443.

EFFECTIVENESS LEVEL/MAINTENANCE CREDIT
The effectiveness level of each system shall be computed separately, on a month by month basis:
                                                      Operational Use Time (OUT)(hours)
                 EL =  100  *                  Scheduled Use Time (SUT)(hours)

All times will be accrued in 15 minute increments and rounded up to the next highest number of hours when computing the monthly effectiveness level.  Further, if any period of Operation Use Time (OUT) of less than three hours duration is immediately preceded and followed by periods of Down Time, and the CR determines that those Down Times were related, that the period OUT will be considered as Down Time in computing the monthly effectiveness level (EL).  EL will be truncated to an integer number.  Times are defined as follows:
             OUT: Scheduled Use Time (SUT) minus down Time.  Time, accumulated in complete 15 minute intervals, during which the contractor maintained system/equipment is considered available. 
             SUT: Time during which the contractor maintained system/equipment is scheduled by the Government for operation use.  Scheduled and unscheduled time out are not included in SUT.
             Scheduled Time Out (STO): time during which the contractor maintained system/equipment is unavailable for operational use.  The Government designated CR or other authorized personnel may establish STO.  The contractor’s manager or other authorized personnel may establish STO for Preventative Maintenance (PM) with prior concurrence of the government CR, at least 24 hours prior to commencement of STO.
            Unscheduled Time Out (UTO):  Time during which the contractor maintained system/equipment is unavailable for operational use due to environmental conditions beyond the control of the contractor and the Government, such as hazardous weather conditions, or failure of Government provided facilities or services which are required  for continued operation of the system/equipment, such as physical access to the building containing the system/equipment, or electrical power loss to a system/equipment not connected to the UPS at the MSRC.  UTO shall be recorded after the fact by Government representative in the System Maintenance Event Log for the MSRC, and requires concurrence of the Government’s CR or their designated representative. 
             Down Time:  Time during which the contractor maintained system/equipment is not available for operational use.  Down Time can only occur during Scheduled Use Time.  Down Time for one contractor maintained system/equipment may result in Down Time for additional contractor maintained system(s)/equipment(s) which depend on that system/equipment for continued operation.  A system/equipment will be considered unavailable for use during an entire 15 minute interval if it is unavailable of used during any portion of the interval.  Down Time shall be record by the Government representative in the System Maintenance Event Log for the MSRC. 

The contractor shall maintain equipment under the contract at a monthly effectiveness level of 98%, at a minimum, for each system/equipment identified.  If the effectiveness level for a system/equipment drops below 98%, the contractor shall grant a 100% maintenance credit.  Maintenance credits will be taken as a discount from the monthly amount due the contractor.  Downtime will be accumulated for the month and rounded off to the next higher hour.

MATLAB/Simulink/Stateflow/Real-time-workshop are engineering software products  used to model real world systems such as aircraft, radars and missiles.   Simulink is a visual programming software package for modeling, simulating,  and analyzing dynamic systems. It supports linear and nonlinear systems,  modeled in continuous time, sampled time, or a hybrid of the two. Systems can  also be multirate, i.e., have different parts that are sampled or updated at  different rates. Stateflow is a graphical design and development tool for  control and supervisory logic that is used in conjunction with Simulink to  develop and implement finite state machine theory.  Stateflow can be used to  provide clear, concise descriptions of complex systems behavior using finite  state machine theory, flow diagrams notations, and state-transition diagrams  all in the same Stateflow diagram.  These products are combined with various  toolboxes to develop advanced engineering capabilities in such fields as  signal processing, control systems, and statistical analysis.

Written document shall be generated, in duplicate, that itemizes any and all visible dents, dings, scratches or other damage and/or defects, as well as, providing an overall assessment of the operational condition of the rental vehicle. This document or "inspection checklist" shall be signed by both inspecting parties and constitutes testament of the condition of vehicle rental at the time of delivery or pick-up by the Government.  The documentation used for this purpose shall be provided by the Contractor and shall be standard commercial type forms or reports. The amount of fuel present shall be noted. The mileage shown on the odometer shall be recorded for informational purposes only.

15.  A second technical inspection shall be conducted jointly by the Contractor and the Government representative at the time vehicle rentals are picked-up, recovered or dropped-off. A written inventory or "inspection checklist" shall be generated for each vehicle rental to record and document the condition of the vehicle at the time it is returned to the Contractor.  Procedure shall follow that of the delivery inspection. Copies of this documentation shall accompany invoices. This document or "inspection checklist" shall be signed by both inspecting parties as testament of the condition of the rental vehicle at the time of return. The document(s) used for this purpose may be the same document used for delivery, so long as, the functions of delivery or pick-up are distinct and easily discernable from that of return or drop-off of the effected vehicle rental.  The Government shall ensure an equal amount of fuel is present at return as was recorded at acceptance. In the event the Government fails to do so, the Contractor agrees any charges to replace missing fuel shall be separate and apart from this contract, and is to be coordinated directly with the Government representative to make arrangement for payment of these charges by Government Credit Card. Mileage incurred on the vehicle rentals will be recorded for informational purposes only.

16.  Refueling of vehicle rentals while in use under this contract shall be the responsibility of the Government (e.g., the Requiring Activity).

Offers may be submitted on company letterhead stationery indicating the National Stock Number, Nomenclature, Part Number and Unit Price.   NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the sam relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES 
[DEC 2003] 
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause.

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
 “Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504
of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 
 
“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs

Notice to Offerors:  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  

Informal forum with the Ombudsman:  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date ( if applicable).  
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman:  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011

Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause.  The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  “Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  “Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 
(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group, which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  “Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 
(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. 
(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal. 	(End of clause)

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation is a request for quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-05  and DFARs Change Notice (DCN) 20050901. This acquisition is a full and open competition.  NAICS is 334220 with a small business size standard of 750 employees.  Solicitation is for commercial purchase of:  13 each Airborne Telmetry Bit Synchronizers .

Description:  The Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC) at Edwards AFB, 419th FLTS, 412 TW/Instrumentation Division, has a requirement for 13 each airborne bit synchronizers.  In addition, it requires a non-recurring engineering effort to modify existing hardware to provide a second set of RS-422 outputs from bit sync (Data & Clock).  The ABS400 is a programmable airborne telemetry bit synchronizer in a rugged design specifically tailored for command and control applications.  With this supplementary module, two RS-422 (differential) data and clock outputs are available from the unit.  Bit synchronizer lock is accomplished and maintained with up to eight errors in the sync code.  Loss of receiver input signal clamps the bit sync operating data rate to the pre-programmed data rate.  Programming is accomplished via an integral RS-232 port.

The basic system consists of a bit synchronizer, frame synchronizer, programming circuitry and power supply.  The system is also expandable to include analog and/or digital output ports.  The frame synchronizer examines the reconstructed digital data stream from the bit synchronizer on a bit-by-bit basis for the “best fit” pattern and outputs a sync pulse when correlation is achieved.  Lock is accomplished and maintained with up to eight errors in the sync code.

An RS-232 port on the frame synchronizer board allows many parameters, such as bits-per-word, words-per-frame, sync pattern, etc., to be programmed.  Reprogramming can be accomplished in the field with a minimum of equipment.  The unit can be configured with multiple bit synchronizers for applications requiring independent synchronization to multiple inputs.

The ABS400 model consists of a Bit Synchronizer and optional Decommutator module with an open architecture that allows other module with an open architecture that allows other module types to be incorporated into the system.  The design allows for a configuration of up to 16 modules attached to the first bit synchronizer.  Although standard building blocks are used in figuring the ABS400, each unit is custom tailored to each customer’s specific application.
 

Because of its modular construction, the unit is reconfigurable to contain 1 to 16 module in addition to the bit synchronizer.  Modules are stacked onto the bit synchronizer modules in virtually any order, and are bolted together with provided hardware.  The unit is then programmed for the appropriate system configuration.  A variety of mounting configurations are available, and custom mounting can also be provided.

Place of delivery, performance, and acceptance is FOB Destination, Edwards AFB, CA 93524.

(2) The vacuum probe station must be configured with six precision micro-manipulated probe arms, with four of the arms oriented orthogonally (at 90-degree relative spacing), and each having precision x-, y-, and z-control with ranges of at least five (5) inches in x, at least two (2) inches in y, and at least one half (1/2) inch in z.   (3) The vacuum probe station must be constructed of stainless steel.  In addition to the six probe arm ports, the vacuum chamber must have a pumping port having NW40 or larger connection, a spare NW25 connection port, and an integral fused quartz viewport to visually locate the probes on the wafer. (4) The system must have an external microscope imaging capability having resolution of 3 micrometers or better.  The external microscope imaging capability must be enabled for remote viewing (e.g., via a video monitor) during probe adjustment.   (5) The system must be able to perform electrical probing measurements at controlled temperatures in the range of 4.5K  475K.  The sample stage must be integrated with both the cryogenic refrigerator and heater elements, and regulated by a temperature con troller. (6) The capability to cryogenically cool the sample stage using either liquid helium or liquid nitrogen is required.  The system must include a high efficiency helium transfer line and a liquid nitrogen Dewar with pressure control. (7) Active radiation shielding of the vacuum chamber is required to provide efficient cryogenic cooling and shield the sample under test from blackbody radiation associated with the chamber or surrounding environment. (8) The probe station must be capable of making fundamental current/voltage (I/V) measurements on a full four-inch wafer in DC, RF, or microwave (up to 40GHz) frequency regimes.   (9) The low frequency probes must be matched to 50 ohm resistance and capable of shielded measurements up to 50MHz, or up to 5 GHz when used with appropriate low-loss microwave cabling.

<DESC>THIS AMENDMENT REPLACES THE PREVIOUS SECURITY CLEARANCE REQUIREMENTS WITH THE FOLLOWING TEXT.  ALL OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS REMAIN UNCHANGED.

***PRE-APPOINTMENT BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS:  The Contractor shall ensure a contractor employee does not begin work under the contract until the appropriate pre-appointment background checks are conducted and approved by the CSOSA Office of Security. When a pre-appointment background check on an individual has been determined to be favorable, the Office of Security will issue an interim employment security approval. Upon notification of approval, the Contractor may notify an individual to begin work at a CSOSA facility.  Derogatory information, falsification of any forms or refuses to supply information and/or forms may be considered justification to reject the individual. The Contractor shall have the individual employees complete a pre-appointment background investigation package consisting of (1)CSOSA-SEC-0010, Security Form for Temporary Contractors or Employees and (2)FD 258, FBI Fingerprint Card. The individual is generally provided 10 days to complete and return the forms to the Agency. The Contractor is responsible for reviewing the forms for completeness. It is the responsibility of the Contractor, in order to ensure complete coverage for the services specified herein, to maintain an adequate staff of individuals meeting all of the requirements of this contract. To that end, the Contractor should submit the names of additional individuals, so requisite pre-appointment background checks can be conducted. CSOSA has the right to request any additional information necessary in order to adjudicate the completed pre-appointment background investigation. If a contractor employee fails to provide any requested information or cooperate with CSOSA Office of Security, the individual will not be cleared for performance under the contract. Contractor Responsibility: (1)The Contractor shall ensure no Contractor employee commences performance prior to completion of the pre-appointment background investigation, unless the Office of Security grants approval. (2)Any individual who has been temporarily removed or resigned may be required to undergo another pre-appointment background investigation before resuming any position. Government Responsibility:  (1) The Government will conduct a pre-appointment background investigation on all individuals involved in the contract. (2) Upon completion of the pre-appointment background investigation, the Office of Security will review the results to determine suitability for the individual.  Primary concern in the review process is to decide if the individual's presence in Agency facilities poses a potential risk to CSOSA, the Government, or the general public.***

AWARD:  The Government intends to award a contract to the responsible offeror whose proposal represents the best overall value for performance of the services identified in this announcement.

Proposals will be evaluated based solely on the factors of Price and Past Performance, as contained in this solicitation.  PRICE IS CONSIDERED EQUAL TO THE PAST PERFORMANCE TECHNICAL FACTOR.  SECURITY REQUIREMENTS FOR CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL:  All unescorted Contractor personnel utilized under this award shall submit to a Government background investigation prior to performing work on-site at any CSOSA facility.  The intent and purpose of this investigation is to preclude the assignment of any individual who poses a threat to the Government or successful work completion due to past unlawful or inappropriate behavior.  Contractor employees must be U.S. citizens, or be lawfully permitted to reside in the United States and possess a valid work permit.  Background Investigations: The Contractor shall ensure that a Contractor employee does not begin work until the appropriate background checks are conducted and approved by the CSOSA Office of Security. When a preliminary background check on an individual has been determined to be favorable, the Office of Security will issue an interim employment security approval to the Office of Procurement, who in turn will notify the Contractor.  Only at that time may the Contractor notify an individual to begin work at a CSOSA facility. Derogatory information, falsification of any forms or refuses to supply information and/or forms may be considered justification to reject the individual. When an individual is selected for contractual employment, the Contractor shall have the individual complete a background investigation package consisting of the items identified below.  The individual is generally provided 10 days to complete and return the forms to the Contracting Officer, or authorized representative.  The following forms will be provided and must be completed:  (1) CSOSA-SEC-0008, Agency Credit Release Form, (2) FD 258, FBI Fingerprint Card, (3) Standard Form 85P, Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions, (4) Contractor Preliminary Background Check Form.  It is the responsibility of the Contractor, in order to ensure complete coverage for the services specified herein, to maintain an adequate staff of individuals meeting all of the requirements of this contract.  To that end, the Contractor should submit the names of additional individuals, so that the requisite preliminary background checks can be conducted. CSOSA has the right to request any additional information necessary in order to adjudicate the completed background investigation.  If a Contractor employee fails to provide any of the above information, or to cooperate with CSOSA Office of Security, the individual will be removed immediately.  Contractor Responsibility: (1) The Contractor shall ensure that no Contractor employee commences performance prior to completion of the background investigation,  unless the Office of Security grants approval.  (2) Any individual who has been temporarily removed or resigned may be required to undergo another background investigation before resuming any position.  At the discretion of the COTR, the Contractor shall forward the required forms for a reinvestigation to the COTR.  Prior to forwarding the forms, the Contractor is responsible for reviewing the forms for completeness. The forms should be forwarded with a cover letter indicating that the forms are for reinvestigation of a current Contractor employee.  Government Responsibility: (1) The Government will conduct a background investigation on all individuals involved in the contract. Derogatory information developed from this investigation may be considered justification to reject the applicant.  The Government also reserves the right to reinvestigate all Contractor personnel working on this contract for any reason.  (2) Upon completion of the background investigation, the Office of Security will review the results to determine suitability for the individual. Primary concern in the review process is to decide if the individual(s) presence in Agency facilities poses a potential risk to CSOSA, the Government, or the general public.  The following Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Provisions, applicable to this combined synopsis and solicitation, are incorporated, in full, by reference:  FAR 52.212-1 Instruction to Offerors and FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications.

<DESC>EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY, THIS REQUIREMENT IS HEREBY CANCELLED.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format prescribed in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation is being issued as a Request for Proposal, solicitation number is H92244-05-R-0082, and a firm fixed price contract is contemplated.

The Naval Special Warfare Development Group (NAVSPECWARDEVGRU) has a potential requirement to procure the following:

CLIN 0001 Repair, Refurbishment and Replacement of NAVSPECWARDEVGRU Obstacle Course in accordance with the following performance based statement of work:

Description of Current Course.  There are no records of date of construction but the course is at least fifteen (15) years old with adhoc repairs made over the years.  The telephone poles are in good shape and may or may not be practical for reuse on new events.  Most of the other materials will need to be replaced.

Limits of Construction.  No trees will be cut down but tree limbs may be trimmed as needed.  The open area between the canals, the tree line in the rear (near fenced area), and the area around the entrance are the border limits of this course; no construction is authorized outside of this area.  A NAVSPECWARDEVGRU representative will walk the perimeter area with vendor prior to start of construction to avoid misunderstanding.  During construction, the workmen will limit their activities to the immediate area when not in transition from the entry control point to the obstacle course.

Required Standards.  The US Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), Regulation 350-6 and Association of Challenge Course Technology (ACCT), or err on the side of safety.

The general requirements of all events and trail ways are as follows:  All materials used in this project will be of the highest quality and able to withstand years of exposure to the elements.  Soft material (ropes, nets, etc.) must be usable and safe for a minimum of three years (at which time these components will be replaced).  All wood products will be treated for outdoor use and made to last for a minimum of twelve years.  All treated materials will meet minimum safety standards for human use.  All metal products (nails, screws, bolts, hangers, etc) will either be galvanized or stainless-steel.  All events will be built in accordance with construction standards were the loads (platforms, crossbeams, etc) is transfer to the ground and not on bolts or screws – the loads will rest on notches on log or on top of posts.  The typical weight to be expected on any one event is 750 pounds (three people) and each event is required to have a minimum of 5:1 load rating (3,750 lbs or better) for safety.  The primary pathway (event to event) will be lined in a wood border and filed with a minimum of four inches of wood mulch.  The area around the events where a fall may happen will be filled with rubber mulch, and all areas that a fall are likely to happen will have a fall arrest device (net, crash pad, etc).   Because each event is different, some minor exceptions are authorized as long as they meet required standards.

Event #1 (Parallel Bars).  New event at the start of the course – similar to the one at the Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek.  A set of approximately 16 foot parallel bars ascends to three tiers.  The bars start at three feet high and should width apart then ascent to the first and highest tier.  The highest tier will be eight feet tall with each subsequent tier one foot lower – each tier is four feet long.  Support post of wood with wood mulch underneath the event.  

Event #2 (Five Pole Vault/Dirty Name).  Currently, there are five vaults in place.  Remove the last two vaults to make room for the dirty name event.  Dirty name built in accordance with TRADOC Reg. 350-6.  Past the dirty name two vaults will be added to the end mimicking the first two existing vaults.  Wood mulch added under vaults and rubber mulch under dirty name.

Event #3 (Rope Climb/Descending Platforms/Balance Beam).  Using existing logs, replace the platform and cross beam.  Replace current rope with 1.5 hemp climbing rope and have rubber mulch underneath.  Balance beam to be bolted to new cross support beams at each end and one in the middle.

Event #4 (Vertical Walls).  Using the existing logs, replace all boards and cap each event.  Fill in ruts on back side and cover with wood mulch on both sides

Event #5 (Rope Climb and Descent).  Using existing logs, replace face with tongue and groove planks on both sides with a cap on top.  Existing metal cross beam replaced with pole spar arm and replace existing rope with 1.5 inch hemp rope.    The area around the wall with has rubber mulch added for fall protection.

Event #6 (Skyscraper/Slide for Life).  This is one of two major events where safety is of primary concern; safety will not be compromised).  Complete replacement of existing event with one built IAW TRADOC Reg. 350-6 (pages 91 and 92).  This 40 foot tall hybrid event will combine two obstacles (skyscraper and slide for life) from Reg. 350-6.  This event will have a safety net about ¾ of the length of the slide rope (following down the ropes angle) ending where the height of the rope is less than eight feet.  This event will have rubber mulch under the entire slide and crash pads at the base of the tower.  Due to the scope of this event, a NAVSPECWARDEVGRU representative will be available to answer questions and provide details during construction.

Event #7 (The tough one).  New event built in open space (path) adjacent to Event #6 to be built in accordance with TRADOC Reg. 350-6 (page 89).  Rubber mulch will be spread under and around the event while crash pads will be located in the primary fall zone.

Event #8 (Monkey Bar/Tarzan).  Using existing poles, the approach side of the event will have a balance beam added similar to “The Tarzan” in TRADOC Reg. 350-6 (page 92).  The balance beam will be with a flattened “Z” in order to stay on path.  The log beam will be about three feet off the ground; each leg should be approximately ten feet.  The monkey bar portion will be raised to level at the approach end.  Wood mulch will be used underneath.

Event #9 (Incline Walls).  Existing event will be removed and replaced with three inclined wall built in accordance with TRADOC Reg. 350-6 (page 94) spaced about eight to ten feet apart with wood mulch around.

Event #10 (Vertical Net Climb).  This is one of two major events where safety is the primary concern; safety will not be compromised.  Current event will be replaced with a 35 foot hybrid version of the typical “cargo net” climbing tower and uses the same safety features as the one at the Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek.  The change from that event is the “A” frame vertical posts – two posts per side to support the inverted “V” net keeping the net taunt with the help of tensioning cables.  The v-net is slightly declined to allow a falling climber to in effect slide down the net thus slowing the fall.  The net tapers outward at the bottom becoming a catch net and effectively absorbing the climbers fall.

Event #11 (Balance Beam/Swing, Stop and Jump).  This event is repaired/restored to original condition.  The improvements will include cross beam, timber pegged or through bolted and the platform built to meet general requirements.  The balance beam will be bolted mounted at both ends.  Rope replaced with 1.5 inch hemp and rubber mulch spread on swing area.

<DESC>EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY, THIS REQUIREMENT IS HEREBY CANCELLED.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format prescribed in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation is being issued as a Request for Proposal, solicitation number is H92244-05-R-0082, and a firm fixed price contract is contemplated.

The Naval Special Warfare Development Group (NAVSPECWARDEVGRU) has a potential requirement to procure the following:

CLIN 0001 Repair, Refurbishment and Replacement of NAVSPECWARDEVGRU Obstacle Course in accordance with the following performance based statement of work:

Description of Current Course.  There are no records of date of construction but the course is at least fifteen (15) years old with adhoc repairs made over the years.  The telephone poles are in good shape and may or may not be practical for reuse on new events.  Most of the other materials will need to be replaced.

Limits of Construction.  No trees will be cut down but tree limbs may be trimmed as needed.  The open area between the canals, the tree line in the rear (near fenced area), and the area around the entrance are the border limits of this course; no construction is authorized outside of this area.  A NAVSPECWARDEVGRU representative will walk the perimeter area with vendor prior to start of construction to avoid misunderstanding.  During construction, the workmen will limit their activities to the immediate area when not in transition from the entry control point to the obstacle course.

Required Standards.  The US Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), Regulation 350-6 and Association of Challenge Course Technology (ACCT), or err on the side of safety.

The general requirements of all events and trail ways are as follows:  All materials used in this project will be of the highest quality and able to withstand years of exposure to the elements.  Soft material (ropes, nets, etc.) must be usable and safe for a minimum of three years (at which time these components will be replaced).  All wood products will be treated for outdoor use and made to last for a minimum of twelve years.  All treated materials will meet minimum safety standards for human use.  All metal products (nails, screws, bolts, hangers, etc) will either be galvanized or stainless-steel.  All events will be built in accordance with construction standards were the loads (platforms, crossbeams, etc) is transfer to the ground and not on bolts or screws – the loads will rest on notches on log or on top of posts.  The typical weight to be expected on any one event is 750 pounds (three people) and each event is required to have a minimum of 5:1 load rating (3,750 lbs or better) for safety.  The primary pathway (event to event) will be lined in a wood border and filed with a minimum of four inches of wood mulch.  The area around the events where a fall may happen will be filled with rubber mulch, and all areas that a fall are likely to happen will have a fall arrest device (net, crash pad, etc).   Because each event is different, some minor exceptions are authorized as long as they meet required standards.

Event #1 (Parallel Bars).  New event at the start of the course – similar to the one at the Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek.  A set of approximately 16 foot parallel bars ascends to three tiers.  The bars start at three feet high and should width apart then ascent to the first and highest tier.  The highest tier will be eight feet tall with each subsequent tier one foot lower – each tier is four feet long.  Support post of wood with wood mulch underneath the event.  

Event #2 (Five Pole Vault/Dirty Name).  Currently, there are five vaults in place.  Remove the last two vaults to make room for the dirty name event.  Dirty name built in accordance with TRADOC Reg. 350-6.  Past the dirty name two vaults will be added to the end mimicking the first two existing vaults.  Wood mulch added under vaults and rubber mulch under dirty name.

Event #3 (Rope Climb/Descending Platforms/Balance Beam).  Using existing logs, replace the platform and cross beam.  Replace current rope with 1.5 hemp climbing rope and have rubber mulch underneath.  Balance beam to be bolted to new cross support beams at each end and one in the middle.

Event #4 (Vertical Walls).  Using the existing logs, replace all boards and cap each event.  Fill in ruts on back side and cover with wood mulch on both sides

Event #5 (Rope Climb and Descent).  Using existing logs, replace face with tongue and groove planks on both sides with a cap on top.  Existing metal cross beam replaced with pole spar arm and replace existing rope with 1.5 inch hemp rope.    The area around the wall with has rubber mulch added for fall protection.

Event #6 (Skyscraper/Slide for Life).  This is one of two major events where safety is of primary concern; safety will not be compromised).  Complete replacement of existing event with one built IAW TRADOC Reg. 350-6 (pages 91 and 92).  This 40 foot tall hybrid event will combine two obstacles (skyscraper and slide for life) from Reg. 350-6.  This event will have a safety net about ¾ of the length of the slide rope (following down the ropes angle) ending where the height of the rope is less than eight feet.  This event will have rubber mulch under the entire slide and crash pads at the base of the tower.  Due to the scope of this event, a NAVSPECWARDEVGRU representative will be available to answer questions and provide details during construction.

Event #7 (The tough one).  New event built in open space (path) adjacent to Event #6 to be built in accordance with TRADOC Reg. 350-6 (page 89).  Rubber mulch will be spread under and around the event while crash pads will be located in the primary fall zone.

Event #8 (Monkey Bar/Tarzan).  Using existing poles, the approach side of the event will have a balance beam added similar to “The Tarzan” in TRADOC Reg. 350-6 (page 92).  The balance beam will be with a flattened “Z” in order to stay on path.  The log beam will be about three feet off the ground; each leg should be approximately ten feet.  The monkey bar portion will be raised to level at the approach end.  Wood mulch will be used underneath.

Event #9 (Incline Walls).  Existing event will be removed and replaced with three inclined wall built in accordance with TRADOC Reg. 350-6 (page 94) spaced about eight to ten feet apart with wood mulch around.

Event #10 (Vertical Net Climb).  This is one of two major events where safety is the primary concern; safety will not be compromised.  Current event will be replaced with a 35 foot hybrid version of the typical “cargo net” climbing tower and uses the same safety features as the one at the Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek.  The change from that event is the “A” frame vertical posts – two posts per side to support the inverted “V” net keeping the net taunt with the help of tensioning cables.  The v-net is slightly declined to allow a falling climber to in effect slide down the net thus slowing the fall.  The net tapers outward at the bottom becoming a catch net and effectively absorbing the climbers fall.

Event #11 (Balance Beam/Swing, Stop and Jump).  This event is repaired/restored to original condition.  The improvements will include cross beam, timber pegged or through bolted and the platform built to meet general requirements.  The balance beam will be bolted mounted at both ends.  Rope replaced with 1.5 inch hemp and rubber mulch spread on swing area.

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  “Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  “Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act,ation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)—

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group, which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  “Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

<DESC>RFQ HSHQDC-05-Q-00041 is hereby amended to incroporate the Performance Work Statement as follows: Scope of Work - The contractor shall provide all labor, materials, transportation, administrative support and other services as necessary to develop, manage and instruct a Writing Intelligence Analysis and Briefings Course to develop and refine writing and briefing skills of intelligence analysts assigned to DHS/IAIP and component intelligence agencies.  The course shall be conducted four (4) times over the course of the contract’s base year period (approximately every other month from contract award date) and four (4) times during each contract option period as exercised.  It is anticipated that up to 20 students will comprise any single class for course instruction purposes, but may exceed this number depending upon mission needs.  Site location(s), which will be within the greater Washington DC area, developmental specifics internal to DHS requirements and designated times for instruction shall be determined as coordinated with the Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR).  The contractor shall work directly with the COTR on all developmental and course instruction matters through out the life of the contract.  The course shall assist intelligence analysts to develop and refine writing and briefing skills specific to the field of intelligence analysis to ensure capability of producing a variety of intelligence related products for senior officials and decision makers throughout the Department, the Intelligence Community (IC), the Executive Branch, as well as other federal, state, local, territorial and tribal partners.

A minimum security clearance of SECRET is required for all instructors.  The course instruction shall integrate a variety of “templates” and examples of written products used in DHS/IAIP and the IC, as well as those templates and forms used by many of the aforementioned Governmental agencies.  The contractor shall work in close coordination with the COTR to identify applicable templates and forms for course integration.  The contractor shall work in close coordination with the COTR to ensure appropriate development and updating of course materials, maintaining course attendance rosters, integrating DHS/IAIP specific writing regulations and requirements, information or templates and creating and issuing certificates upon course completion. The contractor shall coordinate with the COTR on any and all actions and activities associated with this contract including deliverables, which shall be subject to COTR approval.  The contractor shall take reasonable steps to allow the COTR unrestricted and unhampered access to contractor employees accomplishing duties under this contract.  Courses themselves and location(s) for training do not require the contractor to possess a security clearance.  The contractor shall coordinate with the COTR to determine whether this program can qualify for continuing education units (CEU) that are recognized by an Industry Recognized Educational Organization, the American Council on Education or other appropriate educational accreditation body.  Government Furnished Equipment and Information - The Government will provide the contractor with fully furnished classrooms and appropriate audio-visual equipment and information to assist in completing tasks as required.  Data Rights - The Government will retain unlimited rights and license to all intellectual property produced, whether by the Government or contractor, jointly or independently, in the course of supporting DHS under this contract.  The contractor shall have the right to seek patents for intellectual property developed independently or jointly with the Government in support of or under this contract.  The Government shall have unlimited right to use intellectual property that the contractor has independently developed and deploys or uses in supporting DHS under this contract.  The contractor will be required to negotiate agreements with commercial system vendors relating to non-disclosure of vendor-proprietary information.  Security   - The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has determined that performance of this contract requires that the contractor, subcontractor(s), vendor(s), etc. (herein known as contractor), requires access to classified National Security Information (herein known as classified information) and sensitive but unclassified (SBU) information. Classified information is Government information which requires protection in accordance with Executive Order 12958, Classified National Security Information and supplementing directives.  SBU is unclassified information for official use only. Contractor employees that do not have a security clearance and require access to SBU information will be given a suitability determination.  See below the requirements for suitability determination outlined in the security language for SBU contracts.  The contractor shall comply with the requirements set forth in the DD Form 254, Contract Security Classification Specification, included in the contract, and the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) for the protection of classified information at its cleared facility, if applicable, as directed by the Defense Security Service.  If the contractor has access to classified information at a DHS or other Government Facility, it will abide by the requirements set by the agency.  Employment Eligibility  - The contractor shall ensure each employee working on this contract will have a Social Security Card issued and approved by the Social Security Administration.  The contractor shall be responsible to the Government for acts and omissions of his own employees and for any subcontractor(s) and their employees.  Subject to existing law, regulations and/ or other provisions of this contract, illegal or undocumented aliens shall not be employed by the contractor, or this contract.  The contractor shall ensure that this provision is expressly incorporated into any and all subcontracts or subordinate agreements issued in support of this task order.  Continued Eligibility - DHS reserves the right to deny and/ or restrict the facility and information access of any contractor employee whom DHS determines to present a risk of compromising sensitive Government information to which he or she would have access under this contract.  The contractor shall report any adverse information coming to their attention concerning contract employees under the contract to DHS’ Security Office.  Reports based on rumor or innuendo shall not be made.  The subsequent termination of employment of an employee does not obviate the requirement to submit this report.  The report shall include the employees’ name and social security number, along with the adverse information being reported.  The Security Office shall be notified of all terminations/resignations within five days of occurrence.  The contractor shall return any expired DHS issued identification cards and building passes, or those of terminated employees to the COTR.  If an identification card or building pass is not available to be returned, a report must be submitted to the COTR, referencing the pass or card number, name of individual to whom issued, the last known location and disposition of the pass or card.  Suitability Determination -  DHS will have and exercise full control over granting, denying, withholding or terminating unescorted Government facility and/or sensitive Government information access for contractor employees, based upon the results of a background investigation.  DHS may, as it deems appropriate, authorize and make a favorable entry on duty (EOD) decision based on preliminary security checks.  The favorable EOD decision would allow the employees to commence work temporarily prior to the completion of the full investigation.  The granting of a favorable EOD decision shall not be considered as assurance that a full employment suitability authorization will follow as a result thereof.  The granting of a favorable EOD decision or a full employment suitability determination shall in no way prevent, preclude or bar the withdrawal or termination of any such access by DHS, at any time during the term of the contract.  No employee of the contractor shall be allowed unescorted access to a Government facility without a favorable EOD decision or suitability determination by the Security Office.  Contract employees assigned to the contract not needing access to sensitive DHS information or recurring access to DHS’ facilities will not be subject to security suitability screening.  Contract employees awaiting an EOD decision may begin work on the contract provided they do not access sensitive Government information.  Limited access to Government buildings is allowable prior to the EOD decision if the contractor is escorted by a Government employee.  Background Investigations -  Contract employees (to include applicants, temporaries, part-time and replacement employees) under this contract, needing access to sensitive information, shall undergo a position sensitivity analysis based on the duties each individual will perform.  The results of the position sensitivity analysis shall identify the appropriate background investigation to be conducted.  All background investigations will be processed through the Security Office.  Prospective contractor employees shall submit the following completed forms to the Security Office through the COTR no less than 30 days before the starting date of this contract or 30 days prior to entry on duty of any employees, whether a replacement, addition, subcontractor employee, or vendor: Standard Form 85P, “Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions” FD Form 258, “Fingerprint Card” (2 copies), Conditional Access to Sensitive But Unclassified Information, Non-Disclosure Agreement, Disclosure and Authorization Pertaining to Consumer Reports Pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act.  Required forms will be provided by DHS at the time of award of contract.  Only complete packages will be accepted by the Security Office.  Specific instructions on submission of packages will also be provided upon award of contract.  Unless an applicant requiring access to sensitive information has resided in the US for three of the past five years, the Government may not be able to complete a satisfactory background investigation.  In such cases, DHS retains the right to deem an applicant as ineligible due to insufficient background information.  The use of non-U.S. citizens, including Lawful Permanent Residents (LPRs), is not permitted in the performance of this contract for any position that involves access to or development of any DHS IT system.  DHS will consider only U.S. citizens and LPRs for employment.  DHS will not approve LPRs for employment on this contract in any position that requires the LPR to access or assist in the development, operation, management or maintenance of DHS IT systems.  In those instances where other non-IT requirements contained in the contract can be met by using LPRs, those requirements shall be clearly described.  Termination - The DHS Security Office shall be notified of all terminations/resignations within five (5) days of occurrence.  The Contractor shall return to the Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR) all DHS issued identification cards and building passes that have either expired or have been collected from terminated employees.  If an identification card or building pass is not available to be returned, a report shall be submitted to the COTR, referencing the pass or card number, name of individual to whom issued and the last known location and disposition of the pass or card.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation Number N00421-05-R-0157 is issued as a request for proposals (RFP).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through FAC 2005-05 and DCN20050901.  The applicable NAICS is 334418 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.

<RESPDATE>091605
<ARCHDATE>10012005
<CONTACT>Stuart Hitchings, Purchasing Agent, Phone 301-837-0310, Fax 301-837-3227, Email stuart.hitchings@nara.gov
<DESC>The following are answers to questions submitted against this requirement.  


1) The solicitation number is listed as NAMA-05-Q-0038 and the RFQ
number is
listed as NAMA-05-Q-0031.  Are they actually separate numbers or is one
of the
numbers incorrect?   The correct solicitation number is NAMA-05-Q-0038.


2) For the factors to be considered is there a particular weighting
scale or
ranking?
This is a simplified acquisition, with a government estimated price of less than $100,000.  Therefore, formal weighting or ranking procedures are not applicable. 

3) Does NARA currently handle criminal investigations in-house or are
they 
referred to an external agency?

Investigations are handled internally by the Office of Investigations

4) Which systems are currently being utilized for the various aspects of
the
case management process?  Is there documentation available on the
functionality
of these systems?

Multiple systems are currently being used.  Ask Sam is an older commercial product being used to track investigations, and an in-house developed system (built in MS Access) is used for tracking complaints.  There is no documentation that we are aware of for either system.

5) The OIG indicated that their number of cases will be increasing
dramatically.
How many cases are currently investigated per year?  What increase is
anticipated?

Currently the IG’s office receives 250 to 300 complaints per year of which roughly 10% become investigations.  It is anticipated that there could be as much as a 50% increase in the number of investigations over the next five years. 

6) The solicitation mentions that the government is seeking a
commercially established
solution for Case Management.  Would a government owned established
solution be
considered if it can be easily tailored to the requirements of NARA?

Yes – Provided that the technical and functional requirements were met, the solution fits within NARA’s approved IT architecture, and the cost is not prohibitive.

7) On what hardware platform will this solution run?

NARA uses Dell and Sun Solaris hardware.

8) One of the requirements is to "perform trend analysis on case data".
Can more
elaboration be provided in how these trends should be identified and
displayed and
if this capability could not be just as easily accommodated through
robust ad-hoc
reporting?

There is no specific requirement to "perform trend analysis on case data".  Ad-hoc reporting is however a requirement.

9) What are the formats required for the production of reports (HTML,
PDF, Excel?).

There are no specific format requirements, however standard agency formats include Word, PDF, Excel.

10) Is the contract to be awarded on a time and materials basis with the
scope to
be defined during the kick-off meeting?
No this is to be a firm fixed price contract.

11) What is the expected period of performance for this contract?  It
would appear to
be a 60 day period of performance.  Does the government anticipate a
follow-on 
maintenance contract for the system?

The expected period of performance is roughly 60 business days or 2 ½ to 3 months, with yearly software maintenance and license fees.

12) The solicitation states that upon the government's acceptance of the
project plan
a start date will be scheduled.  This seems to imply that a contract
will be awarded
yet no funding will be provided for the initial meeting and project plan
development.
Is this the case?  If so what will the resolution be should the
government fail to 
accept the project plan?

No that is not the case.  Funding will be available as soon as the contract is awarded.

13) The project implementation plan is due to be delivered one day after
contract
award.  It would seem impossible to complete this task -- for any
contractor who does 
not have prior knowledge of the government's unique situation and
requirements -- in
such as way as to produce a quality well thought out plan which is able
to predict the
likely outcomes and scheduling. 

There is no question here.

14) To the extent possible is the government willing to allow
contractors to complete
development and technical tasks off-site and conduct only scheduled
meetings with NARA 
personnel on-site?  We would anticipate that the need for on-site work
would be greater
at the beginning and end of the effort and less during the progression
of the system.
Does the government concur?

Yes

15) Does the government anticipate any development to be done or does
the government
foresee that the selected solution will meet all of their requirements
out of the 
box?  What research has the government conducted to know that all
requirements are
achievable with an existing commercially developed solution?

It is anticipated that there will be minimal configuration of the selected solution necessary to meet the requirements.  This includes renaming field labels, populating list of values, and security settings.  It is anticipated that the reports that will need to be developed will consume the majority of the project time.

Extensive research was conducted within the Federal IG community to ascertain which solutions were being used for investigative case management.  The Paisley product was identified as one being used by several similarly sized and functioning IG offices for investigative case management tracking purposes.  Other solutions were either custom developed and GOTS, which were determined to either not meet requirements or be too costly.  

We would like to request an extension of the current response deadline
to allow time
for the preparation of a bid pending the answers to the questions above.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation is a request for quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-05  and DFARs Change Notice (DCN) 20050901. This acquisition is a full and open competition.  NAICS is 334220 with a small business size standard of 750 employees.  Solicitation is for commercial purchase of:  14 each Airborne Telmetry Bit Synchronizers .

Description:  The Air Force Flight Test Center (AFFTC) at Edwards AFB, 419th FLTS, 412 TW/Instrumentation Division, has a requirement for 14 each airborne bit synchronizers.  In addition, it requires a non-recurring engineering effort to modify existing hardware to provide a second set of RS-422 outputs from bit sync (Data & Clock).  The ABS400 is a programmable airborne telemetry bit synchronizer in a rugged design specifically tailored for command and control applications.  With this supplementary module, two RS-422 (differential) data and clock outputs are available from the unit.  Bit synchronizer lock is accomplished and maintained with up to eight errors in the sync code.  Loss of receiver input signal clamps the bit sync operating data rate to the pre-programmed data rate.  Programming is accomplished via an integral RS-232 port.

The basic system consists of a bit synchronizer, frame synchronizer, programming circuitry and power supply.  The system is also expandable to include analog and/or digital output ports.  The frame synchronizer examines the reconstructed digital data stream from the bit synchronizer on a bit-by-bit basis for the “best fit” pattern and outputs a sync pulse when correlation is achieved.  Lock is accomplished and maintained with up to eight errors in the sync code.

An RS-232 port on the frame synchronizer board allows many parameters, such as bits-per-word, words-per-frame, sync pattern, etc., to be programmed.  Reprogramming can be accomplished in the field with a minimum of equipment.  The unit can be configured with multiple bit synchronizers for applications requiring independent synchronization to multiple inputs.

The ABS400 model consists of a Bit Synchronizer and optional Decommutator module with an open architecture that allows other module with an open architecture that allows other module types to be incorporated into the system.  The design allows for a configuration of up to 16 modules attached to the first bit synchronizer.  Although standard building blocks are used in figuring the ABS400, each unit is custom tailored to each customer’s specific application.
 

Because of its modular construction, the unit is reconfigurable to contain 1 to 16 module in addition to the bit synchronizer.  Modules are stacked onto the bit synchronizer modules in virtually any order, and are bolted together with provided hardware.  The unit is then programmed for the appropriate system configuration.  A variety of mounting configurations are available, and custom mounting can also be provided.

Place of delivery, performance, and acceptance is FOB Destination, Edwards AFB, CA 93524.

<DESC>Amendment NO. 0001

The purpose of this amendment is to add the price schedule.

The Northern Right Whale is among the most endangered large whales in the world with a population size of approximately 340 animals. Human activities including commercial fishing and shipping are a major threat to the survival of this species. There have been several right whale mortalities due to collisions with large vessels during the last three years. In 2004 alone there were three mortalities of pregnant female right whales that were likely associated with vessel strikes. The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) is currently developing a comprehensive strategy to reduce the risk of fatal collisions between right whales and vessel traffic along the U.S. Atlantic coast. 
While there have been several ship strike mortalities in the U.S. mid-Atlantic region between Georgia and New Jersey, there is relatively little information on the seasonal spatial distribution and abundance of right whales in this area. This critical gap in knowledge reduces NMFS’ ability to develop strategies to mitigate vessel collisions. During FY2004 and FY2005, NMFS Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC) conducted preliminary research to deploy passive acoustic monitoring buoys along the U.S. mid-Atlantic to document the seasonal presence of right whales in this area. Results from these studies indicated the presence of right whales in this area during the late winter and early spring and demonstrated the effectiveness of this tool for monitoring right whale habitat use. 
During the fall and winter of 2005-2006 NMFS/SEFSC is continuing this research project to use passive hydroacoustic buoys to monitor for the presence of the North Atlantic Right Whale in shallow continental shelf waters of the mid-Atlantic Bight. This contract will provide vessel support for the deployment and recovery of monitoring buoys. 
Description of Work 
This contract is for vessel services during the recovery and redeployment of 18 passive hydroacoustic buoys in the mid-Atlantic between Cape Fear, North Carolina and Savannah, GA. This mission will employ an oceanographic research vessel at least 65 feet in length. The contractor will provide vessel and operational support for the deployment and recovery of passive hydroacoustic buoys and associated mooring materials. The contractor will supply raw materials and construction of 18 mooring anchors and associated hardware. These anchors consist of scrap metal, chain, and various fasteners used to attach the buoy to the sea floor and prevent equipment loss due to wind and wave action. NMFS will provide acoustic monitoring buoys and technical support aboard the charter vessel to attach the buoys to the moorings, verify their performance, and assist in recovery and deployment.  Due to shallow water, strong currents, and expected high wave action during the deployment of these buoys, it is necessary to deploy them with a significant (>300 lbs.) amount of anchoring material. Diver support is necessary to recover the buoys by manually releasing them from their moorings. 
The buoys will be deployed at locations designated by NMFS. We anticipate deploying three sets of three buoys each along an offshore-onshore transect crossing the bathymetry near Cape Fear, North Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina, and Savannah, Georgia. The first deployment will be of nine buoys during the later half of November, 2005. These buoys will be recovered during late-February, 2006 and another nine buoys will be deployed at the same locations. The final recovery operation of these buoys will occur during late April, 2006. 
Contract Deliverables 
The contractor will provide mooring materials and will assist in deployment and recovery of two sets of 9 passive acoustic monitoring buoys. Precise locations of the buoys at each deployment will be recorded so as to ensure recovery after a 3 month deployment period. The contractor will provide all vessel and logistic support required to achieve successful deployment and recovery of these buoys. 
Conditions of Purchase Order 
The contractor will be paid by invoice following the completion of each deployment/recovery mission period. The purchase order will pay for vessel time and operational expenses, staff expenses, expendable materials, and equipment costs. 
Assumption of Risk and Additional Costs 
The contractor will assume liability for additional unplanned operational costs incurred due to mechanical failures or weather conditions. The recovery and deployment operations should be planned during periods where there is a high expectation of weather conditions that will allow the successful recovery and/or deployment of the buoys. 
Evaluation of Potential Sources 
Potential sources for this contract will be evaluated on the following criteria: 
I. Operational capability and experience 
1) Vessel capability: The vessel must be stationed in the U.S. Atlantic to minimize transit times between the home port and deployment locations. The vessel must be capable of multi-day offshore operations with a minimum operational range of 500 miles. Vessel size must be at least 65 feet in length and rated for offshore work in inclement weather and berthing space for at least 2 scientists beyond the crew and divers. The vessel must have GPS positioning equipment that will allow precise tracking of deployment locations to insure recovery of the buoys. Finally, the vessel must have winches allowing the deployment of anchoring material and buoys exceeding 400 pounds in weight. 
2) Dive Recovery Operation Support: The contractor must be able to provide experienced divers that have the capability to dive in turbid waters at night to recover the buoys that are attached to the sea floor. The vessel must have experience and capability to safely support these dive operations. 
3) Moorings: The contractor must be able to provide scrap metal, chain, and other required materials and construct appropriate moorings that will reduce the probability of losing moored buoys due to wave action. 
4) Availability: The timing of deployment and recovery missions is critical to match both the timing of the right whale migration and the operational lifetime of the moored buoys. The vessel must be available for missions during mid- to late November 2005, mid-February 2006, and mid- to late April 2006. The vessel schedule should be flexible enough to allow alternative dates (within the same general time frame) to account for variable weather conditions. 
5) Experience Deploying and Recovering Moored Equipment: The contractor must demonstrate a history of successful operations to deploy anchored oceanographic equipment and successfully recovering that equipment after long deployments (> 60 days) in the shallow continental shelf waters of the U.S. Atlantic. 
The NOAA Central Region Acquisitions Division requires that all contractors doing business with this office be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR). No award can be made to a company not registered in CCR.     For additional information and to register in CCR, please access the following web site: http://www.ccr.gov.

Are these all Firm Fixed Price with evidence of physical completion? If not can you give an approximate mix of PO/DO, fixed price contracts, labor hour, IDIQ, and cost reimbursable contracts? A1. A mix of all types of  contracts including cost will be supplied. Coordination with ACOs and DCAA will be required. We have both DCMA and DCAA liaisons in house. No approximate mix can be given at this time. Q2. Does this include IDIQ contracts with delivery orders that are not  part of t he 435 count, and if so are we required to document closeout of individual delivery orders before closing the contract? A2. Individual DOs must be closed out. A DO is considered as a closed out contract in the 435 count. Q3. Are the physical fil es in good order, and/or will the contractor be required to reconstruct missing award/modification or other significant documents? A3. Most files are in good order, however reconstruction of files and transferred work from other buying activities will exis t. Q4. Will we have a single CO/KO as point of contact for signing off on closeouts, or will we be working with various COs/KOs? A4. A CO/KO is designated as a team leader. However coordination with the CO/KO of records may be required. Q5. Will contracts be consider ed closed when payment is authorized, or do the records have to be closed in DFAS? A5. Closeouts are considered complete for the 435 count when brought to a point inherently governmental remaining. If a de-obligation is required the amount is t o be noted b y the closeout contractor but does not need to be cleared through DFAS to count fo r the 435 count, provided the work submitted was in accordance with the standards in the PWS. Q6. Am I to understand you correctly, that at each contract close out that time s the rate per contract (contract x rate = billing dollars amount). A6. The contractor will be paid a rate per contract closed out. ie: If the contractor performs 30 contract closeouts in a month, and the rate per contract is $2, they will bi ll as follows: (# of contracts closed out) x (amt per contract closed out) 30 x $2 = $60 Q7.

COMMUNICATIONS-ELECTRONICS LIFE CYCLE MANAGEMENT COMMAND ACQUISITION CENTER (C-E LCMC) CONTRACT CLOSEOUT PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT *********PWS*********    The Contractor will perform a minimum 435 contract closeouts for the period starting 30 September 2005 thru 31 January 2006.  The contracts will be closed out in accordance with all applicable Federal, Defense and Army Rules, Regulations and CE-LCMC Pol icies and Procedures. The Contractor will coordinate contract closeout with the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) and other Procurement Activities when applicable. DD Form 1597, Contract Closeout Checklist will be used by the contractor. Upon compl etion of the closeout process by the contractor, the Contractor will submit a completed DD1594 Contract Completion Statement to the Acquisition Centers assigned Closeout Contracting Officer Team Leader for signature, and disseminate it to the distribution as identified by the Closeout Contracting Officer Team Leader.  In addition to the other remedies set forth in the Contract, if the contractor fails to meet this 435 contract closeout minimum, in accordance with the acceptable standard outlined in this Per formance Work Statement (PWS), the Government is entitled to an adjustment to the contract price at a per contract cost that equals the contract price divided by 435 (contracts) for each contract that the contractor fails to close.  The government understa nds the ability to meet this goal is predicated upon the mitigation of all government impediments to the contractors performance in following the process of closing out contracts. The contractor will be given credit for a contract closeout when it has been  brought to the level where it is ready for closeout meeting with the acceptable work standard outlined in this Performance Work Statement (PWS). The Contractor will also be given credit when the contract closeout is brought to a level that an inherently g overnment issue or action is prohibiting its closeout. Issues of this nature may include unliquidated obligation resolution, de-obligation, patent right determinations and issues inherently governmental beyond the scope or authority of the contractor. The contractor will document the existence of these issues in the Acquisition Center, C-E LCMC, Closeout database. The assigned Contracting Officer Team Leader will review and either concur or disagree on these issues. The intent of this review is to ensure th e Contractor and Government are mutually apprised of issues impacting contractor performance and ensuring they are correctly identified so both the government and contractor mitigates their existence and does not inappropriately penalize the contractor.  T o facilitate identification of impediments and status of contract closure, the contractor will keep a listing by contract number of all contracts being worked on and closed in the Acquisition Center Closeout database. The Acquisition Center Closeout databa se is in Access. The database has a remarks field that the contractor will utilize to identify the stage of contract closeout status and any impediments to closure of the individual contract.  In a monthly report the Contractor will identify by contract nu mber any governmental impediments the government needs to resolve to facilitate contract closure and the number of contracts closed for the month. The contractor will submit to the Contracting Officer Team Leader this monthly report. This is the only repor t required.  The contractor will be given the pool of closeable contracts at the start of the contract and they will disseminate to the Acquisition Center C-E LCMC Sector Chiefs the contract numbers of the contracts they will be working on to close during the contract performance period. The contractor will coordinate this workload as necessary with the Sector Chiefs. In event the government performs a concurrent or redundant  closeout action to the contractor on contracts that the contractor has identified they will be working on; the contractor will be given credit for the closeout action.  The Government will provide office space, computers, phones, fax, email, supplies and access to applicable areas and databases for contract closeout for three personnel. Travel is not anticipated but will be in compliance with the Joint Travel Regulation (JTR). All Contractor employees working on this contract will be required to sign a non -disclosure statement.

Are these all Firm Fixed Price with evidence of physical completion? If not can you give an approximate mix of PO/DO, fixed price contracts, labor hour, IDIQ, and cost reimbursable contracts? A1. A mix of all types o f contracts including cost will be supplied. Coordination with ACOs and DCAA will be required. We have both DCMA and DCAA liaisons in house. No approximate mix can be given at this time. Q2. Does this include IDIQ contracts with delivery orders that are no t part of t he 435 count, and if so are we required to document closeout of individual delivery orders before closing the contract? A2. Individual DOs must be closed out. A DO is considered as a closed out contract in the 435 count. Q3. Are the physical fi les in good order, and/or will the contractor be required to reconstruct missing award/modification or other significant documents? A3. Most files are in good order, however reconstruction of files and transferred work from other buying activities will exi st. Q4. Will we have a single CO/KO as point of contact for signing off on closeouts, or will we be working with various COs/KOs? A4. A CO/KO is designated as a team leader. However coordination with the CO/KO of records may be required. Q5. Will contracts  be consider ed closed when payment is authorized, or do the records have to be closed in DFAS? A5. Closeouts are considered complete for the 435 count when brought to a point inherently governmental remaining. If a de-obligation is required the amount is to be noted b y the closeout contractor but does not need to be cleared through DFAS to count fo r the 435 count, provided the work submitted was in accordance with the standards in the PWS. Q6. Am I to understand you correctly, that at each contract close  out that time s the rate per contract (contract x rate = billing dollars amount). A6. The contractor will be paid a rate per contract closed out. ie: If the contractor performs 30 contract closeouts in a month, and the rate per contract is $2, they will b ill as follows: (# of contracts closed out) x (amt per contract closed out) 30 x $2 = $60 Q7. Will a proposal be required or can a contractor submit a GSA Schedule? A7. This acquisition is not being procured through a GSA Schedule. Therefore a proposal sho uld be submitte d in accordance with the synopsis posted to the ASFI/FedBizOpps website on 31 August 2005. Q8. Would the Government consider a different NAICS code for this procurement? A8. The current NAICS code, 541611, best reflects the type of effort d escribed in the PWS. No waivers will be granted. Q9. What is the expectation on the part of C-E LCMC Acquisition Center, in terms of number of personnel (minimum & maximum) that is made available to complete this project in the span of four months as requi red? A9. The contractor should determine the necessary number of personnel. However, offerors are cautioned that the Government will only provide facilities for up to three (3) employees. Q10.

Can you provide details and criteria on Acceptance:  Install, integrate and demonstrate performance? What will determine performance?  Will it be simply functionality of the cluster, or will there be any benchmark/speed requirements included to determin e performance? A.  There are no benchmarks that we need to run.  Simple functionality of the cluster is all that we are requesting. Q.  We can offer dual-core technology, however this processor technology is more expensive than standard processor technology.  I am concerned about awarding to Low price technically acceptable.  A vendor that does not offer dual-core technology is still t echnically acceptable (according to the specifications this is desired, but is not a requirement), and will certainly come in at a lower cost. A.  Dual core is required.  Min CPU speed is 2.0 GHz.
