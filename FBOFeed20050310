General Characteristics:  The Dome Shelters are a group of shelters used for a variety of applications including warehousing and as an aircraft hanger.  The shelters do not require a foundation and can be erected on both a smooth natural site relatively free of surface rock or on a pre-existing concrete pad.  The domes consist of an aluminum arched frame, tensioned weatherproof fabric, and an electrical system.  The shelters can be erected and disassembled from ground level.  All tools necessary for erection and disassembly are included in the shelter package.  The various configurations have different lengths, door types, end walls, and electrical systems.

The 4K Dome Shelter (5410-01-363-0090EJ) has two Big Mouth Doors that span the shelter width.  It is approximately 60 feet by 60 feet yielding a square footage on the order of 4000 square feet.  The 8K Dome Shelter (5410-01-494-5130EJ) also has two Big Mouth Doors, but has twice as many body panels, approximately doubling the length of the shelter.  The 4K Dome Shelter (5410-01-455-2004EJ) with gabled (flat) end wall is similar to the 4K Dome Shelter, but a flat end all replaces one of the Big Mouth Doors.

The Dome Hanger Extension Assembly (5410-01-500-7537EJ) is not a stand alone item.  It contains the components to create a Dome Hanger Extension Assembly (5410-01-512-3416EJ) that is approximately 5000 square feet, from an existing 4K.  The dome extension contains additional aluminum frame, replacement fabric for the entire shelter, a replacement lighting system, and additional component, including electrical.

Dome Shelters and the Dome Extension Assembly each will require a First Article.  Condition(s) for Waiver of First Article Approval:  Offerors currently in production of the same or similar article for an Air Force contract and who have received First Article approval under the existing contract or offerors who have previously furnished production quantities of the same or similar articles to the Air Force, provided articles thus furnished, have exhibited satisfactory performance in service in the opinion of the Air Force or provided not more than 60 months have elapsed since completion of the contract.

Electronic procedures will be posted for this solicitation on or around 15 Apr 05 and will be posted under RFP FA8518-05-R-75816 at http://www.fedbizops.gov/.  Government Data/Drawings will be available for these items and will be posted with the solicitation.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the sam relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>The Transportation Security Administration intends to award a contract on a single-source basis to Performance Assessment Network, Inc. (PAN). 

The purpose of the contract award is to provide support services to the Federal Flight Deck Officer (FFDO) Program.  The support services include maintenance of the on-line infrastructure that supports all phases of the assessment, selection, and operational processes of the FFDO Program.  In addition, the support services include the delivery, scoring, and reporting of computer-based test results for the application process for the FFDO Program.  

The information technology infrastructure developed by PAN under a previous contract is essential to all aspects of the FFDO program. This infrastructure was developed “from scratch” and is entirely customized to meet the unique needs of the FFDO program. This infrastructure provides the means by which interested volunteers apply to the program, and enables them on a day-to-day basis to verify status, update status, and to identify any personal information required for training and deputation. In addition, this infrastructure provides the basis for the management and conduct of the entire selection process, including testing, psychological interviews, background investigations and training. A single source contract award would alleviate the need for training new vendors to re-create the information technology infrastructure. Duplicative development costs may also be incurred to the Government if a new vendor was required to establish and maintain this infrastructure. Unforeseen problems or obstacles in making the transition to a new vendor could potentially jeopardize program operations and result in unacceptable exposure to security problems.  

The proposed contract award covers a base period of one year, with one option period of one year.

<DESC>In October 2004, fifteen Institutes of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) that support research on the nervous system announced a NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research to enhance cooperative activities among them. (http://neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov/). On behalf of the NIH Neurosciences Blueprint Institutes, the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) is planning to issue a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) to solicit proposals that describe in general terms a research topic and outlines proposal preparation requirements.  The goal is to develop an inventory within a framework that enables concept based queries of the inventory (reflecting multiple levels of biological organization and function) within and across the diverse types of information constituting the inventory.  The inventory will include web accessible, publicly available, national and international research activities, tools, resources and databases relevant to the neuroscience research community. This inventory will enable neuroscientists working on diverse problems to become acquainted with the full spectrum of resources available.  It will also introduce non-neuroscientists to the field, serve as an educational tool for students, and offer the NIH Neuroscience Blueprint Institutes a global perspective on the collective enterprise that they support.  The framework for the inventory enables users to locate, relate, access, integrate and analyze entities to determine those most relevant to their interests. Completion of the technical objectives of this BAA will proceed in two phases.  Phase I will include development and characterization of the inventory (including annotations, descriptors, metadata and other information related to each of its entities), as well as preparation of a white paper.  The white paper will analyze the inventory, and propose a query based framework based on use case studies and the inventory analysis.   Phase II is an option to proceed with development and deployment of the framework enabling concept based queries. The product from this BAA is a full characterization and analysis of existing resources. Innovative technologies and approaches for achieving the technical objectives are encouraged. Expertise familiar with the many domains of neuroscience, information technologies, and knowledge management are required. 

NIDA expects to award a 1-year contract with an option for an additional year to perform Phase II of this effort. BAA No. N01DA-BAA-5-7753 will be available electronically on or about March 28, 2005 and accessed through the Internet at: www.fedbizopps.gov or through the NIDA website address: www.nida.nih.gov/RFP/RFPList.html.  

The solicitation for this acquisition includes a Statement of Objective, Deliverables and Reporting Requirements, Technical Evaluation Criteria, and other necessary Proposal Preparation Instructions.  The electronic BAA contains all information needed to submit an offer.  No printed version of the solicitation document or source list is available.  All responsible offerors may submit a proposal for the government’s consideration.  Proposals will be due on or about May 12, 2003. This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract. See Note 26.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

SECTION M – EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD
52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999)
(a)  This acquisition will utilize the Technically Acceptable-Performance/Price Tradeoff (TA-PPT) source selection procedure to make an integrated assessment for a best value award decision.  A decision on the technical acceptability of each offeror’s proposal will be made.  For those offerors who are determined to be technically acceptable, tradeoffs will be made between past performance and price, with past performance being considered equal to price.  While the Government will strive for maximum objectivity, the tradeoff process, by its nature, is subjective; therefore, professional judgment is implicit throughout the selection process.  Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal conforms to all solicitation requirements, such as required delivery dates, terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those included in paragraph (b)(1) below.
            
(b)   The TA-PPT evaluation process will be accomplished as follows:

     (1)  Technical.   Each offeror’s technical proposal, who meets the government’s required delivery dates, will be evaluated to determine if the offeror provides a sound, compliant approach to meeting the government’s minimum requirements as described in the Schedule of Supplies.  Offeror’s proposals meeting the government’s minimum requirements will determined to be technically “acceptable”.
 
(2)  Performance.  For technically acceptable proposals, the past performance assessment will assess the confidence in the offeror’s ability (which includes, if applicable, the extent of its critical subcontractors’ or teaming partners’ involvement) to successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on the offeror’s demonstrated present and past work record.  The Government will evaluate the offeror’s demonstrated record of contract compliance in supplying products and services that meet users’ needs including cost and schedule.  The currency and relevancy of the information, the source of the information, context of the data and general trends in the contractor’s performance will be considered.  The Government will perform an independent determination of relevancy of the data provided or obtained.  A relevancy determination of the offeror’s present/past performance (which includes, if applicable, the extent of its critical subcontractors’ or teaming partners’ involvement) will be made.  The Government is not bound by the offeror’s opinion of relevancy.  The Government may consider an offeror’s contracts in the aggregate in determining relevancy, should the offeror’s present and past performance lend itself to this approach.  For example, an offeror’s work experience on three contracts may, by definition, represent only a semi-relevant effort when each contract is considered as a stand-alone effort.  However, when these contracts are performed concurrently (in part or in whole) and are assessed in the aggregate, the work may more accurately reflect a very relevant effort.  The following relevancy criteria apply:

•	VERY RELEVANT:  Present/past performance programs involved the magnitude of effort and complexities which are essentially what this solicitation requires. 
•	RELEVANT:  Present/past performance programs involved less magnitude of effort and complexities, including most of what this solicitation requires. 
•	SEMI-RELEVANT: Present/past performance programs involved much less magnitude of effort and complexities, including some of what this solicitation requires. 
•	NOT RELEVANT:  Did not involve any significant aspects of above.

In assessing present and past performance, the Government will employ several approaches, including, but not limited to:

(i).  Information utilized may be obtained from the references listed in the proposal, as well as from other sources known to the Government.  Data from previous source selections may be used if the data is recent and relevant.  Evaluation of present and past performance will include consideration of overall customer satisfaction and conclusions of informed judgment.  

	(ii).  Offerors will be given an opportunity to address adverse past performance information if the offeror has not had a previous opportunity to  respond to the information.  Recent contracts will be examined to ensure that corrective measures have been implemented.  The confidence assessment will consider issues including, but not limited to, the number and severity of the problems, the appropriateness and/or effectiveness of any corrective actions taken (not just planned or promised), and the offeror’s overall work record.  Prompt corrective action in isolated instances may not outweigh overall negative trends.

	(iii).  Past performance information will also be considered regarding any critical subcontractors and key personnel.  If an offeror, or the proposed key employees of the offeror, do not have a past performance history deemed relevant to this solicitation, the offeror will receive a neutral confidence rating.  The neutral confidence rating will be considered in the overall assessment for a best value decision.

	(iv) An overall confidence assessment rating will be made.  The following confidence assessment ratings apply:

Rating				Definition

Blue  			Based on the offerors record of performance there is
exceptional/high confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Green 		Based on the offerors record of performance there is very
good/significant confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Yellow		Based on the offeror’s record of performance there is 
satisfactory/confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Grey			Based on the offeror’s record of performance there is 
neutral/unknown confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Black		Based on the offeror’s record of performance there is
marginal/little confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

Red			Based on the offerors record of performance there is
unsatisfactory/no confidence that they will perform successfully on this contract.

(3)  Price.  

 	    (a) IAW FAR Part 15.305 (a)(1) Cost or Price Evaluation, this competitive procurement will establish the basis for price reasonableness.
	
              (b) Total evaluated price, for award purposes, will be based upon the total price proposed
 (b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
(End of Provision) 

Offerors shall include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications—Commercial Items with its offer. 

The clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions—Commercial Items, as augmented by the Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS) applies to this acquisition.

The clause at 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes Or Executive Orders—Commercial Items, as augmented by the Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS) applies to this acquisition.

<DESC>Modification 3 replaces in its entirety Modification 2 posted March 10, 2005.

The initial notice for BAA 05-18 is hereby revised to add Thrust D.  The announcement sections indicated below are modified as follows.  Please note that the remainder of the announcement is unchanged.  Also included is an addendum to the Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) which adds Thrust D and details its requirements.

	Sections A.VI.a. and B.IV.3 -- extend the initial closing due date for proposals from 1 APR 2005 until 20 APR 2005.

	Section B. -- revise to include Thrust D as indicated.  For further information, please see the addendum to the PIP. 
1.1	PROGRAM OBJECTIVES
Phase 1 of this program has four parallel thrusts. Thrust A seeks to make dramatic advances in the breadth and performance of cognitive models based primarily on modeling the functional psychological components of cognition. Thrust B seeks to develop neurobiologically-inspired theories, designs, and resulting architecture(s). Thrust C seeks development of a framework evaluating implementations of the cognitive architectures created in Thrusts A and B. Thrust D seeks to drive the creation of new classes of representations and techniques for automatically generating usable knowledge from real-world experiences in focused problem domains.  Each of these thrusts is discussed in Section 2, below. Potential bidders must also review the BAA’s Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) for further detail. 

1.2 	PROGRAM SCOPE 
This program consists of two phases. This BAA is for Phase 1 only, which will span 13 months. Within Phase 1 Thrusts A and B, are three sequential tasks: (1) Theory Development, (2) Technical Exchange, and (3) Architecture Development. The first task will have a duration of six months. The second task – a series of technical exchange meetings common to all thrusts – will span a period of about one month. The third task within each thrust will have a duration of six months. Thrust C Task 1 involves the creation of a “cognitive decathalon” and Task 3 is focused on defining a set of challenge problems for Phase II.  Thrust D has two concurrent tasks:  Task 1 is directed at creating architectures, theories, and conducting focused experiments; Task 2 will design test and evaluation methods for the products of Task 1. Thrust D teams will also participate in the technical exchange.

2.	TECHNICAL APPROACH
It is the goal of Thrust A to design computational models of human cognition by modeling functions of the human mind such as (1) perception and attention, (2) learning and memory, and (3) decision making and problem solving. DARPA is seeking cognitive models that result in human-like behavior on real world problems that are not merely “toy” problems. In Thrust B, DARPA seeks a dramatic improvement in our understanding of the brain’s functions and processes. Initially, we seek a major leap in the performance of traditional AI systems by augmenting and informing their designs with neuroscience principles. We expect to develop a global theory of cognition and one or more neurobiologically-inspired, integrated cognitive architectures. DARPA is seeking the development of an evaluation framework, Thrust C, for the cognitive architectures developed under Thrusts A and B. Two test batteries will be developed: a suite of tests of individual cognitive functions and a set of challenge problems that require the integrated use of multiple cognitive functions.  Thrust D is aimed at determining the mechanisms, techniques, representations, architectures, and processing used in human cognition to guide development of computational systems that can respond as robustly, appropriately, and creatively as humans. While Thrust A seeks relatively complete models of human cognition, including episodic memory and episodic learning, along with the other capabilities essential to human cognition, Thrust D seeks architectures and models of Experience-Based Learning focusing on the concept research should investigate innovative approaches and techniques that lead to or enable revolutionary advances in the state-of-the-art. Proposals are not limited to the specific strategies listed above, and alternative visions will be considered. However, proposals should be for research that substantially contributes towards the goals stated.  Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in minor evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice or focuses on special-purpose systems or narrow applications.

II. Award Information 
The Government reserves the right to select all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this solicitation and to make awards without discussions with offerors; however, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Source Selection Authority later determines them to be necessary. Final funding determination will be based on the combination of proposed approaches which will reasonably support program success. Proposals identified for funding may result in a contract, grant, cooperative agreement, or other transaction depending upon the nature of the work proposed, the required degree of interaction between the parties, and other factors. If warranted, portions of resulting awards may be segregated into pre-priced options.

III. Eligibility Information
1. Eligible Applicants
All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal that shall be considered by DARPA. Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals. However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of this research for exclusive competition among these entities.
Awards made under this BAA may be subject to the provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 9.5, Organizational Conflict of Interest. All offerors and proposed subcontractors must affirmatively state whether they are supporting any DARPA technical office(s) through an active contract or subcontract. All affirmations must state which office(s) the offeror supports, and identify the prime contract number. Affirmations should be furnished at the time of proposal submission. All facts relevant to the existence or potential existence of organizational conflicts of interest, as that term is defined in FAR 2.101, must be disclosed in Section II, I. of the proposal, organized by task and year. This disclosure shall include a description of the action the Contractor has taken, or proposes to take, to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate such conflict. 
2. Cost Sharing or Matching
Cost sharing is not required for this particular program; however, cost sharing will be carefully considered where there is an applicable statutory condition relating to the selected funding instrument (e.g., for any Technology Investment Agreement under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2371). 

IV. Application and Submission Information

1. Address to Request Application Package

This announcement contains all information required to submit a proposal. No additional forms, kits, or other materials are needed. [Note: see paragraph 6, “other submission requirements,” for reference to the Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP).]

2. Content and Form of Application Submission
This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) requires completion of a BAA Cover Sheet for each Proposal prior to submission. This cover sheet can be accessed at the following URL:
http://www.dyncorp-is.com/BAA/index.asp?BAAid=05-18

After finalizing the BAA Cover Sheet, the proposer must print the BAA Confirmation Sheet that will automatically appear on the web page. Each proposer is responsible for printing the BAA Confirmation Sheet and attaching it to every copy. The Confirmation Sheet should be the first page of the Proposal. If a proposer intends to submit more than one Proposal, a unique UserId and password must be used in creating each BAA Cover Sheet. Failure to comply with these submission procedures may result in the submission not being evaluated.
Security classification guidance on a DD Form 254 (DoD Contract Security Classification Specification) will not be provided at this time since DARPA is soliciting ideas only. After reviewing incoming proposals, if a determination is made that contract award may result in access to classified information, a DD Form 254 will be issued upon contract award. If you choose to submit a classified proposal you must first receive the permission of the Original Classification Authority to use their information in replying to this BAA. 
REQUIREMENTS/PROCEDURES:  The Award Document for each proposal selected and funded will contain a mandatory requirement for submission of DARPA/IPTO Quarterly Status Reports and an Annual Project Summary Report. These reports will be submitted electronically via the DARPA/IPTO Technical-Financial Information Management System (T-FIMS), utilizing the government-furnished Uniform Resource Locator (URL) on the World Wide Web (WWW). Further details may be found in the Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP).
PROPOSAL FORMAT
Proposers must submit an original and 2 hard copies (3 total) and 2 electronic copies (i.e., 2 separate disks) of the abstract or full proposal (in PDF or Microsoft Word 2000 for IBM-compatible format on a 3.5-inch floppy disk, 100 MB Iomega Zip disk or cd). Mac-formatted disks will not be accepted. Each disk must be clearly labeled with BAA 05-18, proposer organization, proposal title (short title recommended) and Copy number of 2.  

3.  Submission Dates and Times
The full proposal (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) must be submitted in time to reach DARPA by 12:00 NOON (ET) March 1, 2005, in order to be considered during the initial evaluation phase. However, BAA 05-18, Biologically-Inspired Cognitive Architectures (BICA) will remain open until 12:00 NOON (ET) January 17, 2006. Thus, proposals may be submitted at any time from issuance of this BAA through January 17, 2006. While the proposals submitted after the March 1, 2005 deadline will be evaluated by the Government, proposers should keep in mind that the likelihood of funding such proposals is less than for those proposals submitted in connection with the initial evaluation and award schedule. DARPA will acknowledge receipt of submissions and assign control numbers that should be used in all further correspondence regarding proposals.
4. Intergovernmental Review – N/A
5. Funding Restrictions
Authorization of precontract costs will be considered in situations of genuine urgency where programmatic benefits will accrue from their use.
6. Other Submission Requirements
Proposers must obtain the BAA 05-18 Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP), which provides further information on the areas of interest, submission, evaluation, funding processes, and proposal formats. The PIP will be posted directly to FedBizOpps.gov and may also be obtained at URL address http://www.darpa.mil/ipto/Solicitations/solicitations.htm. Proposals not meeting the format described in the pamphlet may not be reviewed. This notice, in conjunction with the BAA 05-18 PIP and all references, constitutes the total BAA. No additional information is available, nor will a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued. Requests for same will be disregarded.

I. Funding Opportunity Description 

1.	INTRODUCTION
The DARPA Information Processing Technology Office (DARPA/IPTO) is soliciting proposals under this BAA to perform research and development to support the Biologically-Inspired Cognitive Architectures (BICA) program. The main goal of the program is to develop and evaluate psychologically-based and neurobiologically-based theories, design principles, and architectures of human cognition. In a subsequent phase, the program has the ultimate goal of implementing and evaluating computational models of human cognition that could eventually be used to simulate human behavior and approach human cognitive performance in a wide range of situations.

1.1	PROGRAM OBJECTIVES
Phase 1 of this program is divided into three parallel thrusts. Thrust A seeks to make dramatic advances in the breadth and performance of cognitive models based primarily on modeling the functional psychological components of cognition. Thrust B seeks to develop neurobiologically-inspired theories, designs, and resulting architecture(s). Thrust C seeks development of a framework evaluating implementations of the cognitive architectures created in Thrusts A and B. Each of these thrusts is discussed in Section 2, below. Potential bidders are encouraged to review the BAA’s Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) for further detail. See section IV-6.

1.2 	PROGRAM SCOPE 
This program consists of 2 phases. This BAA is for Phase 1 only, which will span 13 months. Within each Phase 1 thrust, we anticipate three sequential tasks: (1) Theory Development, (2) Technical Exchange, and (3) Architecture Development. The first task will have a duration of six months. The second task – a series of technical exchange meetings common to all thrusts – will span a period of about one month. The third task within each thrust will have a duration of six months. 

2.	TECHNICAL APPROACH
It is the goal of Thrust A to design computational models of human cognition by modeling functions of the human mind such as (1) perception and attention, (2) learning and memory, and (3) decision making and problem solving. DARPA is seeking cognitive models that result in human-like behavior on real world problems that are not merely “toy” problems. In Thrust B, DARPA seeks a dramatic improvement in our understanding of the brain’s functions and processes.

We expect to develop a global theory of cognition and one or more neurobiologically-inspired, integrated cognitive architectures. DARPA is seeking the development of an evaluation framework, Thrust C, for the cognitive architectures developed under Thrusts A and B. Two test batteries will be developed: a suite of tests of individual cognitive functions and a set of challenge problems that require the integrated use of multiple cognitive functions.

Proposed and schema formation aspects of that phenomenon based on cognitive experiments designed to provide insight into human computational mechanisms that could prove useful in machine cognition.  Test and evaluation methods for use in Phase II will also be developed under Thrust D, including an experiential training data base and the representation(s) and format(s) to provide to researchers and system developers, and a systematic test and evaluation process.

<DESC>WAVEFORMS FOR ACTIVE SENSING, SOL BAA05-19, Addendum 3, DUE: 4/25/05, 400pm ET, POC: Douglas Cochran, DARPA/DSO, Ph: (703) 696-2287. Email: baa05-19@darpa.mil, URL: www.darpa.mil/dso. Website Submission: http://www.sainc.com/dso0519/
DESCRIPTION
The Defense Sciences Office is soliciting innovative proposals to develop waveform design and scheduling methodologies for active sensing systems. Recent technological advances have enabled marked increases in radio-frequency (RF), optical, and acoustic transmitter agility.  The goal of this initiative is development of new waveform and waveform family designs, scheduling techniques, and design tools, based upon rigorous mathematical foundations, to exploit this agility in applications of interest to the Department of Defense (DoD).  Of particular interest are approaches that simultaneously utilize agility at the transmitter and adaptivity of receiver processing to fully exercise the: temporal, spatial, and spectral degrees of freedom entailed in modern and emerging DoD sensing applications.
This program is anticipated to be executed in two phases.  Phase I is expected to run for 15 months and will emphasize mathematical development of new approaches with validation through simulation and possibly laboratory demonstrations. Phase II is planned to run for 21 months and will entail refinement of the techniques developed in Phase I in conjunction with validation and demonstration in DoD-relevant testbed applications.  Proposals should address both program phases and should budget Phase II as an option.
Full proposals only are being accepted with the technical proposals being no more than twenty (20) pages, including cover sheet information and references. No addenda (e.g., reprints of published papers or technical reports) beyond the 20-page limit will be considered in the evaluation process.  Proposals must contain the following elements: (1) Explicit description of one or more DoD-relevant application scenarios around which the project will be focused; (2) Precise quantification of the performance improvements sought via exploitation of waveform agility in the context of the focus application or applications; (3) Concise enumeration of the research challenges entailed in attaining the desired performance improvements sought, the approaches to be used to address these challenges; and (4) Plans for measuring the performance of the new techniques in simulation, laboratory, and testbed environments.  One or more specific, quantitative milestones against which performance of the techniques developed will be benchmarked before the end of Phase I must be explicitly stated in the proposal. Similar milestones for the end of Phase II are also of interest, but these may be modified prior to the selection point for exercise of Phase II options based on insights gained in Phase I research.

<DESC>The United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) mission is to establish and provide full-spectrum global strike, coordinated space and information operations capabilities to meet both deterrent and decisive national security objectives, and to provide operational space support, integrated missile defense, global C4ISR and specialized planning expertise to the joint warfighter. USSTRATCOM’s Acquisition and Contract Management Division (USSTRATCOM/J81) is responsible for acquisition management and planning for all USSTRATCOM computer systems supporting HQs Automated Data Processing (ADP), war planning, and command and control missions.  USSTRATCOM/J81 and the 55th Contracting Squadron at Offutt Air Force Base conducted a Command and Control information briefing on 9 November 2004.  The purpose of the briefing was twofold; it provided the vision of the USSTRATCOM C2 program, acquisition, and contracting approach.  Also included were descriptions of current C2 projects and a discussion of the portfolio of contracts used by the C2 program.  The second purpose was to offer DoD contractors the opportunity to provide feedback on the Government’s future acquisition and contracting plans.  Since the 9 November 2004 industry briefing, USSTRATCOM acquisition planning has progressed with much feedback received from the contractor community.  The purpose of this information notice is to provide an update on USSTRATCOM’s Command and Control (C2) acquisition strategy.  Included is an update to the C2 Information briefing that provides status of requirements currently on the Computing Environment STRATCOM Architecture (CESAR) contract that ends on 30 September 2005.  The final update to this briefing, detailing how USSTRATCOM will align requirements to different contract vehicles, is expected to be posted to FEDBIZOPS by the end of April 2005.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT - NON-COLLINEAR WAVEFRONT CURVATURE RANGING SENSORS - SOURCES SOUGHT - NON-COLLINEAR WAVEFRONT CURVATURE RANGING SENSORS - The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) has identified a need for new sensors that utilize non-collinear wavefront curvature ranging techniques to discern target motion analysis information from transient contacts. This is a synopsis to locate a low cost non-developmental item (NDI) sensor that utilizes techniques, such as time delay of arrival, to determine range, bearing, and depth of a target based on a single transient intercept. This sensor should have a proven record of success in laboratory and at sea tests. This sensor shall be able to interface with existing active intercept and ranging technology and software. This sensor shall be able to utilize collinear and non-collinear wavefront curvature ranging (hyperbolic multilateration) signal analysis techniques and personnel involved in the test and analysis of this program shall!  have demonstrated a level of expertise in the fields of collinear and non-collinear wavefront curvature ranging (hyperbolic multilateration). This program shall have a relative phase delay between sensors of at maximum 200 nanoseconds. Sensors used to fulfill the needs of this program shall have embedded electronics to provide synchronized simultaneous sampling between sensors. This program will be tested for acceptance and applicability to the US Navy utilizing the Foreign Comparative Testing (FCT) program. It is expected that based on a positive result of the FCT, this product will be procured by NAVSEA for insertion into the fleet. Interested parties having the required specialized capabilities to meet all of the above pr opposed requirements should submit to Mr. Chris Pigott, SEA 02623, a two (2) page (maximum) typed expression of interest/capability statement indicating their ability to perform all aspects of the efforts described above. Offerors should describe at a m! inimum their manufacturing capability, test equipment, expertise in the area of hyperbolic multilateration dilution of precision, hydrophone modeling, triangulation, and test facilities, which should accommodate the testing of the sensor system. Responses are required to include the firm name, mailing address, telephone and facsimile numbers, World Wide Web (Internet) presence (if any), size of firm, number of years providing similar level of complexity products, and direct points of contact including phone and e-mail addresses. Only written responses transmitted electronically, by mail, or facsimile will be accepted.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

1.  Can you confirm that we can bid for a completely wireless network (except for the computer room where servers will be wired)?

Yes, you may bid for a completely wireless network. The IRR prefers a wireless system but realizes the limitation with potential dead spaces in the building. A combination of wire and wireless networks is also acceptable. The Contractor shall propose the best LAN architecture as part of the solicitation.

2.  In the meeting we were informed that in addition to the 50 laptops stated in the solicitation, the department is expecting a quote for 150 desktops. Is this correct and should we offer that?

The solicitation mentions 50 laptops. After further consideration, the IRR would prefer to include 150 desktop computers with the solicitation. Assume Compaq, or equivalent high-end computers. New desktops are needed because many of the existing computers are out-dated, low quality, and will not be compatible with the network design. In addition, the contractor will provide 5 document scanners and 5 color laser printers. Assume high-end brand equipment for budgeting purposes.

3.  In the meeting there was referenced to three other locations than the main building, while in the solicitation it was stated two locations only other than the  main building. Also, in the meeting it was stated that the distance to these locations is about 3Km while in the solicitation it is stated as 1.3Km. Can you please clarify the correct number of locations and distances involved?

There are two  locations in addition to the main station building requiring connectivity to the LAN. Distribute the 150 desktop network computers in all three locations ( Baghdad Station - Technical Station Building -Shalchiya )

1.      Shalchiya Shops, approximately 5 Km from the main station;. 
2.      Between the main station and Shalchiya Shops is the Technical Station Building, a

<CONTACT>Lorraine   Vernon, Contract Negotiator, Phone 801-777-0135, Fax 801-777-0389, Email Lorraine.Vernon@hill.af.mil
<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Request for Information (RFI).  The Air Force plans to replace the existing CADC with a more reliable, longer life Unit that carries a ten-year warranty.  This effort will be using performance-based acquisition specifications.  This procurement will be based on the “best value" to the government, not necessarily lowest procurement cost.  The new CADC will incorporate state-of-the-art technology and be compatible with existing hardware and software interfaces in order to maintain form, fit, function and interface to the aircraft.  The information in this request is provided to assist the Air Force in conducting a market survey of industry to identify potential contractors who have the skills, experience, and knowledge required to successfully complete this effort for Hill AFB, Utah.  This is not a Request for Proposal or Invitation for Bid.

We are seeking contractors who are interested in designing and manufacturing a high reliability CADC using modern technology rather than following traditional build to print requirements.  The F-16 Logistics Operations Division has a requirement for an estimated 1300 units.  This effort will replace the current CADC (NSN 6610-01-308-1859, P/N 4025116-907) and also must be compatible with the Upgraded Central Air Data Computer UCADC (NSN 6610-01-372-8170, P/N 8518930-901).

Interested parties are requested to submit two copies of a summary of the capabilities and facilities they have which will allow them to perform the development and manufacture of the CADC.  A rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost estimate and an estimate of the anticipated time between contract award and first article delivery are solicited as an aid in the budgeting process.  Include in the ROM pricing full environmental testing needed for safety of flight certification.  The cost and schedule estimates are for planning purposes only and the contractor will not be bound by these preliminary estimates.  This request for information does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that procurement will be accomplished.  The government does not intend to contract on the basis of this request or otherwise pay for the information solicited.  Written responses must be submitted by 29 April 2005 to OO-ALC/LGKE, ATTN: Lorraine Vernon 6050 Gum Lane, and Hill AFB, UT 84056-5825.  No telephone or fax requests will be accepted.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) of the National Institutes of Health is conducting this market survey to identify small businesses with the capability to serve as a large-scale genotyping center to provide sample receipt and handling, high-throughput genotyping, integration and documentation of phenotypic data, database and website development, bioinformatics, data management, data distribution, and administration. The overall objective of the NHLBI Large-Scale Genotyping Center is to expand the utilization of NHLBI=s well-phenotyped observational cohorts and intervention studies for genetic association studies, through the application of large-scale genotyping and widespread data dissemination for genotype-phenotype correlation. The Genotyping Center will process data set requests from scientific investigators for purposes of data analysis. The NHLBI Large-Scale Genotyping Center will perform in-depth characterization of more than 1,700 candidate genes (8-10 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) per gene region) on approximately 50,000 study members in heart, lung, blood and sleep (HLBS) studies, for a total of more than 850 million genotypes (at a maximum cost, including labor, of $0.01 per genotype at initiation; costs are expected to lower as technologies evolve).  The Genotyping Center must have the capacity to generate at least 850 million genotypes over two years with an error rate of no more than 1%. The NHLBI Large-Scale Genotyping Center will also develop informatic management processes for curation and cross-study data comparison, and provide a computing platform that facilitates data portability, accessibility, and security. The Genotyping Center must keep abreast of the evolving National Electronics Clinical Trials and Research (NECTAR) network as envisioned in the NIH Roadmap (http://nihroadmap.nih.gov/clinicalresearch/overview-networks.asp), as well as the Cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIG, http://cabig.nci.nih.gov/) and the e-health record of the HHS National Health Information Infrastructure (http://aspe.hhs.gov/sp/nhii/) as the computing platform and data set developed for dissemination must be capable of integration and interoperability with these platforms.  The Genotyping Center will also establish comparable, resource-wide standardized phenotypes, controlled vocabularies including metathesaurus, thesaurus, and defined data elements mapped across participating population studies, and prepare uniform protocol models facilitating post-collection coordination and the evaluation of comparability across data sources.  The Genotyping Center will process requests for use of the data generated including: processing applications, ensuring up-to-date IRB approval and completion of data distribution agreements from requesting investigators, creating data sets, distributing data sets to investigators, and providing technical support (answering questions about data).  The Center will also develop and implement plans for distribution of non-identifying summary data, such as allele frequencies, in public databases such as dbSNP.  The Large-Scale Genotyping Center will evaluate the feasibility of a genome-wide association study based on the current state-of-the-art and outputs of studies such as the Design and Analysis for Genome-wide Association Studies RFA, particularly regarding analytic strategies and marker selection.  If feasible, the Genotyping Center will perform a genome-wide association study involving the use of a standard set of up to 300,000 state-of-the-art genetic variants in roughly 500 cases and 1,000 controls, for a total of roughly 450 million genotypes (at a maximum cost of $0.01 per genotype, including labor costs). Other required outputs of the Genotyping Center are monthly reports on quality control, status of genotyping and data integration, and reports on data dissemination.  The applicable NAICS code is 541710 and the size standard is 500 employees.  It is anticipated that one award will be made for a period of 4 years. The contract will be a cost-reimbursement, completion-type. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP) AND NO RFP IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. Small businesses who believe that they possess the capabilities to perform this work must submit an original and three copies of a capability statement to this office by 4:00 PM EST on March 7, 2005. Responses to this market survey should include pertinent information and meet the requirements of this notice. All information submitted in response to this notice must arrive on or before the closing date and time.  Capability Statements should be submitted to the following address:

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) BEING RELEASED PURSUANT TO FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATIONS (FAR) PART 10, MARKET RESEARCH. 
The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) seeks public comment on research, application, and commercialization issues regarding the release of TRANSIMS under an open source license.  As the technology moves from research and development and into deployment, FHWA is considering all options for increasing the public’s access to this technology.
TRANSIMS BACKGROUND:
The Transportation Analysis and SIMulation System (TRANSIMS) is a set of travel modeling procedures (http://tmip.fhwa.dot.gov/transims/modeling_procedures.stm) designed to meet the State Department of Transportations’ (DOTs’) and Metropolitan Planning Organizations’ (MPOs’) need for more accurate and sensitive travel forecasts for transportation planning and emissions analysis. TRANSIMS outputs detailed data on travel, congestion, and emissions; information that is increasingly important to investment decisions and policy setting. Because TRANSIMS simulates and tracks travel by individuals, the benefits to and impacts on different geographies and travel markets can be evaluated as well. Furthermore, TRANSIMS has the capability to evaluate highly congested scenarios and operational changes on highways and transit systems.

TRANSIMS is based on four primary modules: population synthesizer (http://tmip.fhwa.dot.gov/transims/popn_synthesizer.stm), activity generator (http://tmip.fhwa.dot.gov/transims/activity_generator.stm), route planner (http://tmip.fhwa.dot.gov/transims/route_planner.stm), and traffic micro simulator (http://tmip.fhwa.dot.gov/transims/traffic_microsimulator.stm). Using these components, TRANSIMS estimates activities for individuals and households, plans trips satisfying those activities, assigns trips to routes, and creates a micro simulation of all vehicles, transportation systems, and resulting traffic in a given study area.

TRANSIMS differs from previous travel demand forecasting methods (http://tmip.fhwa.dot.gov/transims/transims_compared.stm ) in its underlying concepts and structure. These differences include a consistent and continuous representation of time; a detailed representation of persons and households; time-dependent routing; and a person-based micro simulator. These advances are producing significant changes in the travel forecasting process. To date the TRANSIMS models have been tested with data from Dallas, Texas, and Portland, Oregon.

TRANSIMS was developed by researchers at the Los Alamos National Laboratory and is available commercially through the IBM TRANSIMS Solution Center. The development of TRANSIMS has been funded by the Federal Highway Administration, the Federal Transit Administration and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Transportation Policy of the United States Department of Transportation, and by the Environmental Protection Agency.

OPEN SOURCE BACKGROUND:
FHWA is considering the release of the TRANSIMS software and source code under the NASA Open Source Agreement (http://www.opensource.org/licenses/nasa1.3.php). This would allow anyone a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, distribute, reproduce, modify, redistribute, and display the software. Any subsequent changes to the original source code files by anyone must also be made available under the same terms. However, combinations with larger works would not be subject to the same terms.  While there are other well-known examples of managed open source licenses, FHWA considers the NASA Open Source Agreement superior in that the terms are more clearly specified relative to other similar licenses.
KEY ISSUES:
1.	Under a copy-left style license such as the NASA License, a technical gatekeeper function would be necessary to preserve the functional integrity of the code base, deal with all version control issues, and ensure an appropriate degree of security as third parties propose changes to the current code base. How might this be implemented?

2.	Under a copy-left style license such as the NASA License, an intellectual property gatekeeper function would likely be necessary to maintain the integrity of the license and document the flow of contributions as third parties propose changes. How might this be implemented?


3.	What are the expectations for technical support and maintenance? How does communal support compare to fee-for-support?


4.	What are the likely advantages/disadvantages/concerns with using open source software in an academic environment? 


5.	What are the likely advantages/disadvantages/concerns with using open source software in a commercial environment?


6.	What issues and concerns do private entities/public agencies have regarding open source software?


7.	What are any other issues/concerns that should be addressed but have not been?

<SUBJECT>A -- LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS PARTNERS TO COMMERCIALIZE FRMWORK: AN INTEGRATIVE METHODOLOGY FOR PROCESS/QUALITY IMPROVEMENT
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS PARTNERS TO COMMERCIALIZE FRMWORK: AN INTEGRATIVE METHODOLOGY FOR PROCESS/QUALITY IMPROVEMENT
Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is seeking a partner to support further research in its software based process (FRMWORK) for improving manufacturing efficiency.  FRMWORK is an Integrative Methodology for Process/Quality Improvement.  Alternatively, the Laboratory  seeks  to license the technology to interested parties. 

FRMWORK can be used to improve the efficiency of various processes of manufacture, including, for example, automobile production, clothing manufacture, electronic devices such as computers or any process that utilizes production lines and repetitive steps which are quantifiable. The advantages of FRMWORK are as follows:

·	FRMWORK focuses on real-time quality control in manufacturing processes and strives to reduce quality variation due to common or special causes.  

·	FRMWORK integrates Automatic Process Control, Statistical Process Control, and Bayesian Belief  Networks to significantly reduce quality variation.  

·	The integration has demonstrated it can significantly reduce quality variation. Most importantly, the integration takes advantage of all technologies in process control, overcomes the limitations of each technology, addresses the two major sources of quality variation (special and common causes), and offers more than one way to improve quality

FRMWORK focuses on real-time quality control in manufacturing processes and strives to reduce quality variation due to common or special causes.  These processes have the following characteristics: 1) performance measures are auto-correlated due to frequent sampling or common causes; 2) the relationships between quality variation and causes cannot be exhaustively listed; and 3) the causes that are responsible for quality variation cannot be pre-determined, making real-time trouble-shooting a necessity.  

 
Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's FRMWORK  technology should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.	Company Name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology.

Written responses should be directed to:

Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
	Industrial Partnerships and Commercialization
	P.O. Box 808, L-795
	Livermore, CA  94551-0808
	Attention:  FBO 101-05

Please provide your written statement within thirty (30) days from the date this announcement is published to ensure consideration of your interest in LLNL's FRMWORK technology.

<DESC>Air Mobility Command (AMC), is hosting AMC Industry Day 2004 at Scott AFB, IL 1-2 Sep 2004.  The objective of this event is to provide Air Mobility Command’s (AMC) strategic roadmap to industry and research conduits in a symposium like atmosphere.  Each directorate within AMC will have the opportunity to share their ‘way ahead’ briefings to a keenly interested audience.  

Industry Day provides a legal yet dynamic environment for information flow from the command to the senior leaders in the commercial and research/academic sectors.  Industry and research conduits gain by gathering a first hand understanding of AMC’s priorities and mission direction in the near, mid, and long terms.  Air Mobility Command gains from products better suited to AMC’s requirements, at lower costs, and within the desired timeframes.

By sharing our vision with the leaders and representatives of industry and research centers, we hope to give them the opportunity to match their strategies with our strategic mission view.  

Our ultimate goals are effective products, at affordable costs, ready to perform the mission when we need them to support the national military strategy.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included with this notice. This commercial item acquisition is being conducted in accordance with subpart 13.5. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is HSCG23-05-R-DSA020 and it is being issued as a Request for Proposals (RFP). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-26. This solicitation is a small business set-aside. The NAIC code is 332992 and the small business size standard is 1,000 employees. The U. S. Coast Guard (USCG) will award a firm-fixed-price, Indefinite Quantity, Indefinite Delivery type contract for the purchase of .40 caliber full metal jacket (ball) ammunition to support the USCG’s new service handgun (SIG SAUER P229R-DAK).  International convention identifies full metal jacket (ball) as the ammunition to be used by combatants who are party to the convention.  As such, USCG operations often involve deployment to hostile areas and are subject to said requirements.  Currently, the USCG does not have an established source of supply for .40 caliber full metal jacket (ball) ammunition either through the Department of Defense or other Federal Government agencies and as such, is seeking to put in place an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to procure the required ammunition.  The contractor shall provide the ammunition to the following standards:  Projectile caliber:  .40 caliber.  Projectile weight:  155 grains.  Projectile muzzle velocity:  1190 feet per second + 30 feet per second.  Projectile shape:  full metal jacket (ball).  Projectile construction:  lead core with a copper jacket.

Accuracy:  The desired Grouping shall have an average radius of no greater than 1.5 inches for five (5), five shot groups fired at a distance of 25 yards.  

The minimum quantity is 2,000,000 rounds over the life of the contract.  The maximum quantity is 2,000,000 rounds per year and 6,000,000 rounds for the total period of performance.  The period of performance shall be from date of award through 365 days thereafter, with two one-year option periods.  Prices for CLIN 0001 will be used for orders placed from contract award through 365 days (Base Period).  Prices for 1001 will be used for orders placed during Option Period 1 and prices for 2001 will be used for orders placed during Option Period 2.  The anticipated delivery schedule is 60 days after the initial award of the first Delivery Order for the first 200,000 rounds, with each increment of 200,000 rounds that are ordered to be delivered at a rate of 30 days thereafter for that Delivery Order and all subsequent orders.

    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.

By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296 of November 25, 2002.

<DESC>Solicitation # EOPOA-25010 (originally posted on 3/2/05) for News Summary and News Clip Services is hereby amended to provide responses to questions about the solicitation and to extend the time and due date for receipt of proposals to 12:00 noon, Friday, March 18, 2005.   (1)  How many people will have access to the News Summary/briefing for  WHNS and ONDCPNB?   Response:  The WHNS is made available via the EOP intranet to all Executive Office of the President staff of approximately 2500 employees.   The WHNS Clips are made available to approximately 100 White House staff and the ONDCPNB is made available to approximately 150 ONDCP staff.  (2) Will the same number of people for each News Summary/Briefing have access to the IP-Protected web site?  Response: As noted in question # 1, the WHNS is made available EOP-wide through the EOP intranet to approximately 2500 staff. (3) Who is the incumbent?  Response: Bulletin News Network.

The solicitation is amended to add the following as an Optional item to this solicitation:  Office of the Vice President News Clips (OVPNC).   NOTE:  Offerors shall price the WHNS and clips as line item 0001; ONDCPNB as line item 0002; and the OVPNC as line item 0003 (include a base period and four (4) one-year option periods for each line item.  Please note that the optional OVPNC, item 0003, will be evaluated separately and the Government reserves the right to make a separate award for this line item.  Proposal requirements are the same as for the WHNS and the ONDCPNB.  This optional item for the OVPNC will have a base year and four (4) one-year option periods to be exercised at the discretion of the Office of the Vice President.  SOURCES:  The OVPNC shall focus on news in (NEWSPAPERS): The Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, New York Times, Washington Times, USA Today, Los Angeles Times, Detroit News, New York Post, Baltimore Sun, Miami Herald, Chicago Tribune, Seattle Post-Intelligencer, Atlanta Constitution-Journal, the Boston Globe; (WIRES): AP, Reuters, Bloomberg, Dow Jones, UPI;  (TELEVISION): national news from ABC, CBS, NBC, PBS, CNN and MSNBC, FOXNEWS; and (NEWSWEEKLIES): Newsweek, TIME, and U.S.News & World Report.  Offeror must also monitor the nation’s remaining media, including most regional and local newspapers, local TV news, Internet news, relevant specialty press, and some overseas press, for unique or breaking stories.  DELIVERY: The clips document shall be delivered by e-mail to the Vice President’s Press Office Monday through Friday by 6:00 a.m. Eastern Time and on Saturday and Sunday by 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time. EDITORIAL APPROACH:  The OVPNC briefing documents must be written such that they inform EOP officials completely without forcing them to read redundant or irrelevant information such as would be found in the original full-text stories.  To accomplish this, the offeror will (1) use its expertise regarding the White House and the Office of the Vice President to find potentially relevant stories from the sources described above, and will use both keyword search and manual-search methodologies to ensure completeness; (2) review the stories and apply an understanding of policy and other news topics that relate to the missions of the Office of the Vice President; (3) determine which aspects of each story, if any, are important for the respective briefings; (4) organize this relevant material by topic; and (5) weave that information into new, concise, multi-source stories or, where appropriate, condensed single-source summaries.  Each briefing must: (6) be prepared using experienced analytical abilities; (7) include an interactive cover index organized by subject matter; (8) include hypertext links in each write-up to the original media source when available, and (9) be available for redistribution to approximately 110 OVP employees (10) All the above tasks must be performed fast enough to ensure the Office of the Vice President have the most current news, including that from that morning’s newspapers and TV broadcasts from the previous 24 hours.  (11) The offeror’s editorial operations must also be extremely flexible.  (12) The Office of the Vice President will require, on short notice, that additional versions of the briefing be prepared and that those versions be delivered on deadlines as early as 1:00 a.m. Eastern Time when, for example, the Vice President travels overseas.  To demonstrate the ability to create the Office of the Vice President News Clips, the vendor must produce electronic samples of the briefing and clips, including email and Internet delivery, by 6:00 a.m. for a period of 5 days.

QUESTION:
Does the base want a signed corps map?  

ANSWER:        
No, we will not get a "signed Corps map".  For clarification:  the Corps will only sign/certify a plat when a Professional Land Surveyor (PLS) (or professional licensed surveyor) has attached his seal to the plat.  At this time we don't need to have the plat certified.

<DESC>AMENDMENT NO. 1.

The due date for the Request for Information has been extended from March 15, 2005 to June 15, 2005.  

END OF AMENDMENT NO. 1

Request for Information  

“Interoperability problems in the capital facilities industry stem from the highly fragmented nature of the industry, the industry’s continued paper-based business practices, a lack of standardization, and inconsistent technology adoption among stakeholders.  Based on interviews and surveys it is found that $15.8 billion in annual interoperability costs were quantified for the capital facilities industry in 2002.  Of these costs, two-thirds are borne by owners and operators, which incur most of these costs during ongoing facility operation and maintenance (O&M).”  

The United States General Services Administration (GSA) / Public Buildings Service (PBS) is seeking information from industry partners on Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) -Based, Integrated and Interoperable Building Information Model (BIM) technology as part of its effort to improve project deliveries in the capital construction program.  The GSA/PBS currently has an active pipeline of more than 200 major capital construction projects conclusively exceeding a value of eleven (11) billion United States dollars. 

In December of 2003, the GSA/PBS issued internal guidance to its regional staff stressing the need to focus on on-time and under budget deliveries of projects in the capital construction program, with specific initiatives to improve each project's definition and execution processes.  New and emerging technologies such as 3D/4D and Building Information Models, according to this guidance, have the potential to dramatically improve the outcome of projects and enhance customer satisfaction.  

During 2004, several industry milestones have further supported the GSA/PBS’s resolve:

•	The publication of The Construction Users Roundtable (CURT) A/E Productivity Task Force Report which strongly encourages the use of virtual modeling as a keystone to improved A/E design delivery.  Information pertaining to CURT may be viewed at their website, http://www.curt.org/.  

•	The publication of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Study on the "Cost Analysis of Inadequate Interoperability in the U.S. Capital Facilities Industry." Information pertaining to this study may be viewed at the NIST website, http://www.bfrl.nist.gov/oae/publications/gcrs/04867.pdf. 

On-going engagement between the GSA/PBS and numerous industry partners and organizations on this issue include :  The American Institute of Architects (AIA), Construction Users Roundtable (CURT), Construction Specifications Institute (CSI), Construction Management Association of America (CMAA), Association of General Contractors (AGC), Civil Engineering Research Laboratory (CERL), Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Federal Facilities Council (FFC), Stanford Center for Integrated Facilities Engineering (CIFE), the Open Standards for Commercial Real Estate (OSCRE) , FIATECH, the National Institute of Building Sciences (NIBS), and the International Alliance for Interoperability (IAI). 

The General Services Administration/Public Buildings Service, National Capital Region, Washington, DC announces an opportunity for firms in the design, construction, facility management, and real property industries to submit information on the use of IFC-BIM Technology.  This information will be utilized to assist the government in establishing potential sources in the marketplace with knowledge and experience in the use and practices of this state-of-the-art technology.  This is not a solicitation or request for specific proposals.  
 
For each submission, provide at a minimum, the below listed information in the following format:

I:  	Name of Company or Organization, Contact Name, phone number and email address, Description of product or service, product literature or other information, and expressions of interest.
II:	Include examples of best practices, case studies, white papers, published articles, PowerPoint or multimedia presentations, and identify any software packages.
III:	Identify architecture, consulting, construction management and construction professional organizations, firms, and individuals that are currently involved in or with corporate and organizational strategies supporting and promoting this new paradigm.
IV:	Identify any improved business processes, integrated decision making practices, and collaborative design processes that have been established as a result of this technology.
V:	List all known BIM contracting specifications.
VI:	Any other beneficial information.

All information submitted must be in the public domain and not proprietary or otherwise business confidential.  The GSA/PBS may, at its sole discretion, request additional information from items submitted and review and publish the information as a body of knowledge on a publicly Accessible website. Submit all information by email or with word, PDF, PowerPoint, URLs, or other attachments no later than March 15, 2005 to: ifc.bim@gsa.gov. Any questions regarding this request for information may also be submitted to the same email address.

COAST GUARD BACK-UP BATTERY STUDY

1	GENERAL.

1.1	Background:  The United States Coast Guard (USCG) operates 51 ground based Maritime Differential Global Positioning (DGPS) broadcast sites throughout the Continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.  These DGPS broadcast sites operate from commercial power, with a battery back-up system comprised of 12 Valve-Regulated Lead Acid (VRLA), Sealed Lead Acid (SLA) size 8G8D 12 Voltage Direct Current (VDC) Gel-Cell batteries connected in series to provide over 20 hours of back-up power to USCG DGPS broadcast equipment during a commercial power outage.  While Gel-Cell batteries have always been the standard back-up battery for the USCG’s DGPS system, the USCG is interested in newer battery technologies, such as the Absorbed Glass Mat (AGM) battery technology, and with researching any other battery technologies that will enhance or improve the existing standard back-up battery performance, longevity, and deep-cycling capabilities.  
 
1.2	Typical USCG Maritime DGPS(V)1 Site Configuration:  

1.2.1	The standard USCG DGPS site equipment shelter climate control is facilitated by two heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems working either singularly or in tandem to maintain a constant 68 degrees Fahrenheit continuously for 365 days a year.  Some DGPS site equipment shelters are configured with a separate, but attached back-up battery compartment which is not climate controlled, other than by a simple electric exhaust fan facilitating the flow of air through the battery compartment which helps prevent condensation and mold growth, and helps exhaust heat from inside the battery compartment.  DGPS sites without a separate attached battery compartment house the batteries inside the HVAC climate controlled space with DGPS electronic equipment.  Most Maritime DGPS(V)1 sites are located near the East and West Coasts of the United States (US), or along the Coasts of Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the Gulf of Mexico.  Some Maritime DGPS(V)1 sites are located near the Great Lakes, Mississippi River and Inter-Coastal Waterways of the Mid-West (refer to the GFP list of DGPS sites, ref. 8.h, and 8.i).  Most DGPS sites are located in remote un-manned areas of the US, often suffering from erratic commercial power fluctuations and occasional power outages.      

1.3	Personnel.

If pre-existing certification is required, would approval and certification from other services be considered in partial fulfillment of this requirement? No. 9. With the exception of training, would it be possible to perform some or all of the work (particularly the software development) at the contractor site? No. 10. Do you have a detailed set of specifications or are the requirements pretty much stated in the draft solicitation notice?  The requirement is as stated in the Statement of Work of the combined synopsis/solicitation. 11.  Does an existing capablity or software package exist where the DoD want to modify or re-develop? No. 12.  How will the Supply Chain Management System interact with other Army inventory and accounting systems?  For example, will the Supply Chain system send the DD 1149 to an ordering system? Yes. 13. Will the shopping catalog require electronic interface to a contracting system or are ordered items stored in the depot? Yes. 14.  Does the Army require that the system be physically installed at Redstone Arsenal.  Yes. NOTE. All offerors are required to be on a GSA schedule.
