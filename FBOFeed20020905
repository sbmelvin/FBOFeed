<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED.   This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 97-20. The following provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition: 1) 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial (OCT 2000); 2) 52.212-3, Offeror, Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items; 3) 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items (APR 1998), with an addendum; and 4) 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Commercial Items (AUG 2000).  This is a 100% small business setaside. NAICS code is 541618.  The U.S. Department of Interior, Minerals Management Service  (MMS) is soliciting a Request for Proposal for Solicitation Number 1435-01-02-RP-85336 MMS 2004-2008 Implementation Plan.  The MMS Implementation Plan will chart a course for the bureau for the next five years, describe its goals and the strategies, initiatives, and activities to achieve the goals.  The Department of the Interior (DOI) is developing a new Strategic Plan for 2004-2008.  The DOI Strategic Plan will present DOI's goals, strategies and activities in an integrated document that will satisfy the requirements of the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) and OMB circulars.   The separate MMS Implementation Plan will not be a GPRA plan but it is intended to be an implementation roadmap for employees to achieve the goals of the MMS. The MMS Implementation Plan will link to the end outcomes and intermediate strategies in the DOI 2004-2008 Strategic Plan.  The MMS Implementation Plan will be based on logic models developed by its two major program areas:  Offshore Minerals Management and Minerals Revenue Management.  The MMS Implementation Plan should be no more than 45 pages, interesting to read, and easy to understand.  It should present MMS's story from the corporate perspective and focus on our role in ensuring the nation's energy future, our partnerships with industry and other stakeholders, and our role in the international energy picture.  MMS will construct all mission statements, goals, targets, and strategies. The contractor will edit, compose, design the presentation, develop charts and graphs and in general improve the clarity, brevity, and understandability of the document. While our primary audience is internal, the MMS Implementation Plan will also be a roadmap for other interested parties such as Congress. It will contain graphics and photos and be edited for plain English. Minerals Management Service  intends to competitively award a firm fixed price contract for this effort.  ESTIMATED LEVEL OF EFFORT:  The government estimates a period of performance for this contract of five (5) months and an approximate cost not to exceed $60,000.

<DESC>The Government intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, a firm-fixed-price (FFP) acquisition with The Council for Excellence in Government (The Council). This action is being issued by GovWorks under the authority of the Department of the Interior Franchise Fund on the behalf of the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC).  This action is being processed in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source, and solicited in accordance with FAR 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items.  The Council is a not for profit organization that has been assisting the Federal Government and other institutions in implementing more effective business practices and in incorporating electronic technologies into government processes and service delivery activities.  The Council is ideally situated to promote the NSDI because of its identification with promoting electronic government as a tool for improving performance of government. The Council is working closely with the Bush Administration on many aspects of its performance management and e-government agendas.  The Council is unique in its ability to transcend political interests and represent continued interests of good government. CEG is playing an important role in the OMB Geospatial One-Stop Initiative by ensuring an integration of Geospatial initiative from OMB and by providing a well respected voice for the development of Electronic-Government (E-Gov) Initiative that incorporate geospatial information as a key component. CEG has been successful in its first year under cooperative agreement 01HQAG0025. CEG has successfully engaged with forty States committed to be I -Teams and twenty-eight active. Five states have submitted I-Pans.  The FGDC is working to advance the technology used in the creation, storage, retrieval and display of geospatial information, and to promote the use of standards relating to those functions. It is essential for government at all levels to transition to business processes that support the exchange of information in real time, and the ability for anybody, anywhere, anytime to readily access, plug in and use information for any legitimate purpose with confidence that it is timely, accurate, and complete. There are many barriers to the sharing of data that is at the heart of this business process transformation.  I-Teams help address and mitigate these barriers. The OMB Geospatial Information Initiative is a joint effort of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), FGDC, the Council, and other strategic partners from all sectors of the community.  I-Teams organize the production and maintenance of America's data assets in the most effective and efficient ways.  They help all levels of government fulfill their missions and provide better service to citizens. I-Teams simplify and unify business processes, address institutional barriers, and help identify the best partner to produce and steward data. They develop I-Plans for the production and stewardship of their portions of America's data assets.  During the period of this contract, the Council will support the efforts of OMB and the FGDC to promote electronic government to improve government performance, better connect people to government, spatially enable the delivery of government services, and accelerate development of the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) and support evolving administration Geospatial and e-government initiatives advance the national geographic information agenda.  The period of performance for this effort is for 24 months from date of award.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities by September 20, 2002 via email at tracy.lambert@mms.gov <mailto:tracy.lambert@mms.gov>  or fax at 703-787-1009 or they can be sent to Department of the Interior GovWorks, 381 Elden Street, MS 2500, Herndon, VA 20170-4817.  This is NOT a request for competitive proposals. However, all information received will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

B. PRICE 1. Price Reasonableness  a) The evaluation of price will be performed on the offerors proposal for the purpose of determining Price Reasonableness.   b) Reasonableness will be evaluated pursuant to FAR 31.201-3 to establish that the price does not exceed what a prudent person in the conduct of competitive business would normally incur.   2.

EPJS-Light can jettison 15-foot, 22-foot, and singl e 28-foot extraction parachutes.  An EPJS-Heavy is required for jettisoning clusters of two and three 28-foot extraction parachutes, and it must be interoperable with the EPJS-Light.  Performance requirements and verification methods are described in the E PJS-Heavy Purchase Description document available in the Soldier Systems Center's website.  Emphasis will be placed on safe control of jettisoned components.  For informational purposes only and to obtain the latest information regarding the EPJS-Heavy bef ore the RFP release, please go to Soldier Systems Centers web site at https://www3.natick.army.mil/under Business Opportunities/UPCOMING ACQUISITIONS/DAAD16-02-R-0035/Files Available for Download.  Purchase Description, background information, and drawing s are available for download. The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be posted on the Soldier Systems Center web site located at https://www3.natick.army.mil/ under Business Opportunities/Ongoing Acquisitions/DAAD16-02-R-0035 on or about 30 September 2002. NO  hardcopies will be mailed. Telephone calls will not be accepted. Questions may be sent to Ms. Xinia Llovet-Zurinaga, Contract Specialist, via e-mail at Xinia.Llovet-Zurinaga@natick.army.mil or fax (508) 233-5286 or 4998. Firms will not be reimbursed for a ny costs associated with proposal preparation. Proposal evaluation will include, but not be limited to, the following processes: A RFP will be issued and offerors' proposals will be evaluated to determine the item's ability to meet the requirements stated in the EPJS-Heavy Purchase Description. A competitive range will be established, and offerors of proposals that fall within the range and have systems or system components available for purchase may be issued purchase orders for systems or components to be  tested and evaluated. If systems or components are available, one extraction parachute jettison device and the means to activate it at least three times must be ready for testing 90 days after issuance of purchase order. Offerors will be required to provi de repair and training support during these tests, and will be compensated for such support as a separate Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) in the purchase order. These hardware items will be subjected to a limited test and evaluation but will not be flight  tested. Based upon the proposals review and results of any test and evaluation of purchased hardware items, a single contract will then be awarded to the successful offeror to include a System Development and Design Validation Base Effort, an option for D esign Refinement and Testing, an option for Operational Testing, an option for Production Drawings, and options for production. The Base Effort will include CLINs for test items, engineering, and testing support. The Base Effort will require 2 complete EPJ S-Heavy systems and be a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFP) type contract. Test items will undergo evaluation for fit, form and function, and will also be subjected to airdrop testing. An option (CPFF) to refine the design and manufacture 10 EPJS-Heavy test articl es may be exercised and the items subjected to Development Testing (DT) to determine if they satisfy all performance requirements. This option will include CLINs for test items, engineering, and testing support.  Upon successful completion of DT an option (CPFF) to reconfigure any non-conforming hardware to production configuration may be exercised.  This option would include preparing and conducting Operational Tester training and Instructor and Key Personnel training, and preparing technical manual change s and provisioning data.  If Operational Test is successful and the Army decides to acquire and field the EPJS-Heavy, a production option - Firm Fixed Price (FF P) may be exercised to meet the Army's estimated fielding requirements of approximately 250 EPJS-Heavy systems. Another FFP option to acquire production drawings may also be exercised.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 33 6413.  This acquisition will be conducted on a 100 percent Small Business Set Aside.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; p roposals will be accepted, however a written solicitation will not be issued.  The combined Synopsis/ Request for Proposal (RFP) number is AMSTAC-Y0-9902.   The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Fede ral Acquisition Circular 97-14, dated 24 Sep 1999.  The associated standard industrial classification code is 334310, with a size standard of 750 employees. Provision at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to OfferorsCommercial, applies to this acquisition.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  (i) technical capability of the items offered to meet the Government requirement and (ii) price.

Requests for information concerning this solicitation should be made to Caro l Paton, 586-574-7129 or by e-mail. I. General Information. &#61485; Each section of the quotations shall be separable to facilitate review by the Government. &#61485; In the event that we select your quotations for award, we will send out a contract for you signature, incorporating the previous terms and conditions, and particulars of your quotation. &#61485; A site visit is not mandatory but strongly recommended.  A site visit will be prearranged during normal duty hours 8:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. (EST).  Please contact the buyers for date and time via e-mail at patonc@tacom.army.mil. &#61485; The Government intends to evaluate proposals and to award a single contract without discussions with offerors.  The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.  Should discus sions be deemed necessary due to proposal weakness, deficiency, or other issues that must be addressed before award, they will be conducted either orally or in writing, with only those offerors determined to competitive range by successfully meeting the mi nimum requirements. II. Evaluation Factors for Award Award will go to the responsible offeror whose proposal conforms to the solicitation, and represents the best overall value to the Government in terms of the evaluation areas of Technical Capability and Price, subject to proposals being found minimally acc eptable.  Because Technical Capability and Price (listed in their descending order of importance) will be considered, the award will not necessarily go to the low offeror.  Technical Capability is more important than Price. III. Evaluation of Minimum Requirements Offerors will first be evaluated on an Acceptable/Unacceptable basis to determine whether they satisfy the Minimum Requirements identif ied in paragraph VII, items 1-23 of the Statement of Work.  An offeror will be considered to have an Acceptable proposal only if the proposal is found to clearly meet each of the minimum requirements included in paragraphs listed above.  Any offer found unacceptable in one or more or the identified minimum requirements will not be considered for further evaluation or award. IV. Best Value Evaluation. In addition to the evaluation of minimum requirements, each offeror shall be evaluated in terms of Technical Capability and Price as follows: A. TECHNICAL CAPABILITY 1. System Quality Proposals will be evaluated to determine the extent to which the system offered exceeds the minimum requirements, outlined in Section VII Ballroom Room Items 1-20 and Caldwell Room Items 1-14, to the benefit of the Government.  Proposals exceeding the mini mum requirements will be more favorably considered.  2. Site Design/Installation The Government will evaluate the offerors site diagram configuration.  This evaluation will consist of the following: a) Credibility and feasibility of the proposed configuration considering placement of all equipment, cabinets and racks that maximizes space and provides an environment conducive to conferencing, meeting, and training activities. b) Feasibility and soundness of the proposed electrical and structural configurations. B. PRICE 1. Price Reasonableness  a) The evaluation of price will be performed on the offerors proposal for the purpose of determining Price Reasonableness.   b) Reasonableness will be evaluated pursuant to FAR 31.201-3 to establish that the price does not exceed what a prudent person in the conduct of competitive business would normally incur.   2. Price Ceiling a) It is reasonable to expect that funding in the amount of $40,000.00 will become available for this acquisition.  These funds, if and when they become available, will be utilized for the acquisition of the entire system.  It is not anticipated that addit ional funding will be received.  b) For evaluation purposes, offers received whose total amount exceeds 	$40,000.00, shall be deemed unaffordable, and therefore, will not be considered 	for award. V. Instructions to Offerors Provide an electronic proposal in three sections covering Technical Capability, Price and Site Design/Installation:  A. Technical Section. 1. Describe your proposed equipment in relation to each requirement listed in the Minimum Requirements, Section VII.   2. If your offer includes equipment that deviates from those models specified in Section VII, you must provide information detailing how your proposed equipment meets or exceeds the minimum requirement in terms of technical capability and system quality. B. Price Section. 1. Firm-fixed pricing shall apply.   2. Provide pricing information for each item in your proposal including installation and supplies. C. Site Design/Installation Section. 1.

<DESC>The Weapon Systems and Technology Team from the Heavy Armaments Division (HAD) of the Close Combat Armament Center (CCAC)Picatinny Arsenal, has US Army  responsibility for the design and development of Advanced Concept Tank  Ammunition.  Typically, several programs are ongoing within the Weapon Systems  and Technology Team at any one time.   For each program, several concepts are  usually considered.   A vehicle is needed to provide manufacturing/machine shop  support capability for the development and testing of these concepts.  Items to  be produced will be "speciality in nature".  Other items may involve the use  of "smart materials" or other exotic materials.  This contract will mainly  involve, but not limited to, large calibers.  It may also involve, but not  limited to, medium calibers as well.  In order that the Government receive  desired high quality products in a timely manner, face-to-face contact between  the Government Design Engineers and the contractor manufacturing/assembly  Technicians must be encouraged and maintained.  This must be accomplished in a  way which is mutually beneficial to both the government and the contractor.    Having the contractor for this proposed contract located within a 40-mile  radius of Picatinny Arsenal will accomplish this by allowing the government  design engineer(s) to leave Picatinny Arsenal at a moments notice to travel to  the contractors facility and arrive within one hour. Therefore, a 40 mile  radius restriction will be required.  The items to be manufactured and  assembled during the course of this contract are of a Highly complex/highly  specialized nature and will involve the use of emerging technologies (e.g.,  microelectromechanical systems (a.k.a. MEMS)) and/or exotic materials (e.g.,  shaped memory alloys (a.k.a. SMAs)). Notes 1 and 26 apply.

<DESC>SUBJECT: ACQUISITION OF THE ENGINE MODELING SOFTWARE PRODUCT.. DESC: The U.S. Department of Energy's National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), intends to award a  purchase order on a sole-source basis to Ricardo Software, Ricardo Inc., Burr Ridge, IL to complete the following statement of work. STATEMENT OF WORK: "SPECIFICATION STATEMENT FOR ACQUISITION OF A GENERAL PURPOSE SOFTWARE TOOL FOR MODELING RECIPROCATING ENGINES IN ADVANCED ENERGY SYSTEMS ANALYSIS AT NETL". The National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) is a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) lab promoting development and commercialization of advanced energy systems encompassing a wide range of fossil fuel resources (coal, natural gas, petroleum) and fuel to power conversion technologies (gas turbines, fuel cells, internal combustion engines).  Advanced energy systems often involve multiple resources or technologies (cofiring or combined cycles) whose complexity generally requires evaluation by means of computer based simulation.  Fuel cell/gas turbine hybrids are integrated combined cycles of a high temperature fuel cell and a gas turbine which have been evaluated over the past several years in conjunction with the Vision 21 Program.  Recently a need has arisen to evaluate fuel cell/reciprocating engine hybrids, and hence, to acquire modeling capability of the reciprocating engines. We believe the best approach for our purposes will be through a single software tool that is multipurpose, allowing for consistent treatment of the diverse types of engines that are possible with hybrid systems.  Furthermore, since hybridization implies non-standard operating points for the underlying power cycles, the software tool needs to be flexible, allowing for predictive capabilities, and scalable, allowing for various levels of modeling detail through modern interfaces to external software products or detailed user models.  Finally, in-as-much-as a commercially acceptable offering is already known (see Ricardo Software's WAVE), the software tool needs to be a widely accepted commercial offering with the full range of technical support including training and updating for advances in hardware and/or software.  These requirements are further described below: 1.  Multipurpose - it is necessary to have a convenient means of consistently modeling diverse engines such as 2-cycle versus 4-cycle, spark ignited versus diesel, natural gas versus distillates, etc.; overall engine performance parameters need to be computed, including energy balances, material balances, and emissions (e.g. brake efficiency, volumetric efficiency, scavenging efficiency, pumping losses, heat losses, NOX emissions, carbon emissions, etc.). 2.  Flexible - it is necessary to have predictive capabilities with respect to operating conditions or design parameters which may be non-standard with respect to stand-alone engine applications; predictive capabilities need to be realistic and validated, with indicated limits and/or defaults for technically feasible operating conditions or design parameters (e.g. engine speed, compression ratio, knock intensity, valve timing, ignition timing, material temperatures, air: fuel ration, exhaust gas recycle, etc.). 3.  Scalable - it is necessary that the level of modeling detail is scalable; while most evaluation needs will be best addressed with a simple multi-zonal cylinder model, the ability to link to more detailed cylinder models (discretized multi-dimensional cylinders) could be valuable in connection with modeling non-standard operating conditions or design points; the ability to link to external CFD codes or user kinetics models could be significant longer term value (Fluent is the CFD code used at NETL). 4.  Commercial - as mentioned above, a widely accepted commercial offering with a full range of training and technical support is sought; it also needs to be executable on the standard NETL desktop (PC running Windows 2000). This purchase order is being issued to Ricardo Software, Ricardo Inc., because to our knowledge, there is one commercial offering which fully satisfies NETL's engine modeling requirements for a multipurpose tool that can be consistently used for different kinds of engines and fuels with flexibility and scalability concerning the levels of detail that are modeled.  The engine and power train simulator is called WAVE and is licensed by Ricardo Software, a premier consulting company to the automotive industry.  Ricardo Software is a veritable standard in the engine design industry and using ti to communicate ideas and concepts would enable such ideas to be set forth in a "universal" language that obviates translation problems between other potential modeling programs. Ricardo also hosts periodic training seminars and an annual worldwide users conference that would be valuable forums for communication with representatives from the engine design industry.  No other commercial offering is known that provides both the technical capabilities and the communication commonality that is available with WAVE. This request is considered to be sole source to Ricardo Software, Ricardo Inc. Therefore, no solicitation will result from this announcement.  This award shall be made using simplified acquisition procedures.  A purchase order will be awarded aproximately on September 20, 2002. Requests for solicitation will be considered non-responsive.  NO TELEPHONE REQUESTS.   For technical questions please contact the Technical Representative Mr. Rodney Geisbrecht at 412-386-4870. Request for contract information should be addressed to Mr. Robert L. Mohn, FAX 412-386-5770 and e-mail mohn@netl.doe.gov.

<CONTACT>Aundra Richards, Contracting Officer, 510-637-1901, aundra.richards@oak.doe.gov;Nicholas Jackson, Contract Specialist, 510-637-1995, nicholas.jackson@oak.doe.gov
<DESC>This is a sole source acquisition for the purpose of obtaining the unique capabilities and expert services of Russian and Graphics, of Gaithersburg, MD, for translation and interpreting services.  A three year contract with two one-year options is contemplated. In 1993, the U.S. and Russia signed the Highly Enriched Uranium (HEU) Purchase Agreement.  The purpose of the agreement was to reduce the world nuclear proliferation threat by allowing Russia to sell HEU from dismantled nuclear weapons to the U.S. in the form of Low Enriched Uranium (LEU) for use in commercial nuclear power plants.  The HEU Transparency Implementation Program (TIP) was established to develop and implement transparency procedures that provide assurance that the nuclear non-proliferation objectives of the Agreement are meet.  Assurance is obtained through observation of production processes at Russian plants, assessment of production and shipping documents, and monitoring and measurement of in-process and final product. The proposed procurement is for the translation and interpretation from Russian to English or English to Russian of documents and meetings/negotiations in support of the HEU Transparency Implementation Program. The documents to be translated involve formal agreements on how U.S. and Russia will conduct the program, technical details on how monitors will conduct site visits, technical discussions on the types of data to be viewed and how that data will be interpreted/analyzed, and logistics information on the program and personnel involved. Russian and Graphics has unique capabilities to meet the Statement of Work: (1) Russian and Graphics has translated and interpreted for the HEU Implementation Program since the beginning of the program in 1995.  Russian and Graphics has an exclusive corporate history of  the Program and of the negotiation strategies with the Russians and how those strategies were translated into the Agreement Annexes.  Conducting a new procurement for these services would cause a disruption in  the required continuity and efficiency of the program, and would create unduly costs to the Government.  (2) Russian and Graphics has a unique understanding of the technical concepts and nomenclature used in the nuclear process of converting high enriched uranium to low enriched uranium. Russian and Graphics has developed a unique glossary of phrases and terminology both technical and programmatic that are used in the program.  The glossary is used by Russian and Graphics interpreters to assure consistency in how documents are translated. Sources believing themselves capable of successfully meeting the requirements of the Statement of Work may respond by submitting a Statement of Capability to the Contract Specialist by September 12, 2002.

<DESC>The Precision Strike System Program Office (SPO), Air Armament Center, Eglin AFB, Florida is issuing a sources sought synopsis in response to the need for an aerial decoy, in relation to the Suppression of Enemy Air Defense (SEAD) mission.  The Precision Strike SPO plans to contract for the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) of a low cost, expendable, air launched vehicle that can present the radar signature and operational flight profile characteristics of a fighter/bomber/attack aircraft with sufficient fidelity to stimulate, deceive and decoy threat Integrated Air Defense System (IADS).  The aerial decoy is anticipated to be the first in the Miniature Air Launched Decoy (MALD) system family.  Provisions for spiral development of a stand-in jammer to counter early warning, acquisition, and fire control radar systems must be considered.  The short duration, expendable, low cost nature of the vehicle should be considered first in application of existing technology to the various vehicles.  It is desired that the physical appearance of all MALD family vehicles (decoy, jammer, etc.) appear to be identical to the casual observer.  As a threshold, the vehicle will be capable of being carried on and launched from a USAF B-52H bomber and F-16C/D fighter aircraft with objective carriage on the F-15C-E, B-1B, C-130, A/OA-10, B-2, F-22 and Joint Strike Fighter (JSF).  Any requirement for communication between the host aircraft and the MALD will be design dependent. A cost type contract for SDD is planned for award in the third quarter of FY03, and will be of approximately 60 months duration including 24 months of seamless verification .  The end product will be a low cost, producible, expendable decoy.   The development contract will contain an option for a 150 unit Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) phase prior to proceeding to a full rate production decision.  The acquisition strategy objective is to use, wherever possible, already developed and mature technologies and components in order to achieve a low cost and timely solution.  The most current MALD documents have been placed in the on line data exchange system - ATIMS for review and will be updated on a continuing basis.  Access to ATIMS is through the website http://atims.hill.af.mil.  A Draft Request For Proposal (DRFP) and subsequently a Request For Proposal (RFP) will be placed on the Government Website www.fedbizopps.gov.  The Program Office anticipates the release of the DRFP approximately 60 days from this announcement.  Interested firms are requested to submit information outlining their capabilities no later than 15 days after publication of this notice to Ms. Karen Schutt, AAC/WMGK, 102 W "D" Ave, Suite 300, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-6808 or by email at karen.schutt@eglin.af.mil.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ) under the number FA4452-02-Q-A291.  This document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in affect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-08.  In accordance with FAR Subpart 19.2, it is the policy of the Government to provide maximum practicable opportunities in its acquisitions for small business concerns.  In accordance with FAR Subpart 19.5, this acquisition has been exclusively set aside for participation by small business concerns.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541511.  Small business size standard is $21.0M. AMC Contracting Flight intends to issue a purchase order for the following:  Microsoft Premier/Alliance support to maintain Microsoft Windows 2000 operating system on the United States Transportation Command?s (USTRANSCOM) Local Area Network.  Statement of Work Microsoft Premier/Alliance Support:  1.  Scope
This Statement of Work (SOW) describes requested areas of service for Microsoft Premier/Alliance Support.  This service provides technical support to maintain Microsoft Windows 2000 operating system on the United States Transportation Command?s (USTRANSCOM) Local Area Network (LAN).  All support services will be provided to USTRANSCOM located at Scott AFB, IL.  USTRANSCOM is migrating the unclassified and classified LAN?s to Microsoft 2000 operating system.  Requested support is to provide technical assistance and guidance for problems or difficulties that may arise with Microsoft Windows 2000 operating system during the term of this support agreement.  2.  Program Description
Microsoft?s Premier/Alliance Support shall consist of:  2.1.  Account Management.  Technical Account Manager ("TAM") to build and maintain technical relationships with USTRANSCOM key management and support staff and to ensure each element of Premier Support meets USTRANSCOM?s requirements. 2.2.

Provide USTRANSCOM staff round-the-clock access to Microsoft support professionals for rapid resolution of complex problems.   2.4.1  Levels of Support.  USTRANSCOM currently maintains three levels of support in house.  Level 1 is the first contact or help desk type support, Level 2 is the system administrator level of support, and Level 3 is the developer level of support.  This SOW envisions that the Microsoft TAM will coordinate within the Microsoft structure as appropriate.  It is important that all levels of support be heterogeneous in that information entered into any problem tracking system will be immediately available to all levels of support within Microsoft. While the initial request for assistance, as set up under other paragraphs of this SOW, will usually start at a "help desk" like point, the ability to immediately escalate to Level 3 support (developers) without any delay or obstruction is required.  2.5.  Account Resources:  2.5.1.  Technical Account Manager (TAM) assigned to function as a single point of contact to coordinate and deliver proactive, responsive, and online services to meet USTRANSCOM needs. TAM shall direct other members of the support team to ensure USTRANSCOM?s satisfaction.  2.5.2.  Alliance Support Team (AST) is a group of designated support professionals who are familiar with USTRANSCOM?s environment and support needs.  To ensure high levels of system availability and reliability AST provides both proactive services and problem resolution services.  3. Tasks The contractor shall provide the following services:
3.1.  TAM support.  Up to 450 hours of account management services shall be delivered by the TAM to help coordinate and streamline the support relationship.  The TAM shall be USTRANSCOM?s advocate within Microsoft and directs a team providing proactive services, technical support, and information services.  The TAM serves as the point of information delivery feedback to the product groups, quality and testing labs, research and development, and other Microsoft groups.  USTRANSCOM will plan for the utilization of Account Management time to ensure sufficient TAM availability for Proactive Services.  3.1.1.  Account management services include:  3.1.1.1.  Orientation and Planning Session.  Within two weeks after contract award, an orientation and planning session shall be conducted with USTRANSCOM management and staff to discuss the services available, gather input, and jointly develop a Service Delivery Plan.  This meeting may be held via teleconference.  3.1.1.2.  Management.  Incidents that require escalation to Microsoft technical and management resources will be closely managed to expedite resolution.  USTRANSCOM may provide an internal escalation process to facilitate communication between management levels in Microsoft and USTRANSCOM as appropriate.  3.1.1.3.  Service Delivery Plan.  The Service Delivery Plan shall be delivered within 30 days after contract ward and will represent a roadmap for using Premier Support services during the year.  Components of the plan may include high-level objectives, overview of major projects, key satisfaction drivers, resource requirements, and a schedule of planned activities.  3.1.1.4.  Status Meetings and Reporting.  The contractor shall provide a monthly status report NLT 15 days into the following month.  The status report shall summarize services delivered during the previous period and assess progress against the Service Delivery Plan.  Status meetings may be conducted to discuss service activities, review and/or modify the Service Delivery Plan, monitor USTRANSCOM?s satisfaction levels, and discuss actions required.  These meetings will also include a review of support incidents submitted during the previous period and an outline of the services provided by the Alliance Support Team.  These meetings will be held via teleconference.  3.1.2.  Proactive Services help USTRANSCOM plan and prepare for effective systems management and operations.  Proactive Services include the following:  3.1.2.1.  Support Consulting.  Microsoft shall provide support consulting to identify and help prevent common support issues to decrease the likelihood of system outages and reduce total costs.  3.1.2.2.  Supportability Reviews.  Microsoft shall conduct supportability reviews to provide a systems assurance review of a plan for a specific system implementation, migration, or upgrade and may provide recommendations for a more stable and supportable environment.  Each review is individually scoped and estimated prior to scheduling resources, and a written report is produced to document the review results.  In order for Microsoft to complete a review during the term of this Services Description, applicable data should be submitted to Microsoft no later than 60 days prior to expiration.  3.2.  Alliance Support Team (AST).  Alliance Support Team shall provide up to 450 hours support to USTRANSCOM.  AST shall consist of designated Support Professionals familiar with the USTRANSCOM?s environment, product utilization, in-house support structure and support requirements.  The Alliance Support Team will service Exchange and Windows Servers.  A designated support professional familiar with the USTRANSCOM environment will handle incidents submitted to the Alliance Support Team.  These support professionals shall be are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week when pre-arranged to support escalations or planned deployments.  Incidents submitted to this team may require resources from the standard product support queues for resolution although ownership of the incident remains with the Alliance Support Team.  Depending on availability of designated Support Professionals and the criticality of the issue to USTRANSCOM, incidents may need to be opened with the standard product support queues through the Traditional Incident Model.  Incidents opened directly with the Alliance Support Team do not affect the total incident pool.
3.3.  Incidents.  USTRANSCOM shall have preferred access to Microsoft support professionals 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  Up to 60 Incidents may be submitted via telephone or electronically by the USTRANSCOM Support Manager and designated USTRANSCOM Contacts through the online support web site.  To preserve response time commitments, any incident designated by USTRANSCOM as Severity Level A or B (Critical Incident Submission) must be submitted via telephone to Microsoft?s Support Center.  Incidents are drawn from a pre-paid pool.  The USTRANSCOM Support Manager will control the management of this pool and utilization trends will be reviewed during regular status meetings.  The incident severity will determine the response levels within Microsoft and the estimated response times are defined in the following table.  An "incident" is defined as a single support issue and the reasonable effort(s) needed to resolve it.  A single support issue is a problem that cannot be broken down into subordinate problems.  If a problem consists of subordinate problems, each subordinate problem shall be considered a separate incident.  Before Microsoft provides support for an incident, USTRANSCOM and Microsoft?s support professional(s) must agree on what the problem is and the parameters for an acceptable solution.  An incident may require multiple telephone calls and off-line research to achieve final resolution.  3.4.  Information Services.  Information Services shall provide technical information about Microsoft products and support tools that enable USTRANSCOM to implement and operate Microsoft products in an efficient and effective manner.  3.4.1.

Microsoft Knowledge Base of technical articles and troubleshooting tools and guides used by Microsoft support professionals.  3.4.2.  Participation in Expert Roundtables.  Expert Roundtables are regularly scheduled teleconference discussions led by Microsoft program managers, developers and support professionals covering key areas of Microsoft technology.  3.4.3.  Microsoft TechNet Plus Subscription.  A single server license of TechNet Plus provides a comprehensive information resource distributed on CD-ROM that includes 300,000 pages of technical documentation, Resource Kits, and Service Packs.  3.4.4.

<DESC>The Government intends to acquire via full and open competition procedures, integrated logistic support services, including inventory and logistics distribution for the contract period necessary to:
      a. operate a full service walk-in retail store at Naval Station Norfolk (Super Servmart); 
      b. operate a full service walk-in retail store at Naval Air Station Oceana (Oceana Touch-N-Go Servmart);
      c. operate a mobile retail store(s), which shall service Hampton Roads Area VA and Elizabeth City NC Area U.S. Government activities;
      d. provide a free delivery service (with no minimum order required) to Hampton Roads Area and Elizabeth City NC Area U.S. Government activities; 
      e. participate in the DoD E-Mall by providing an electronic file of the Contractor's catalog; and
      f. provide floppy diskettes of each walk-in store catalog to customers upon request and each time the catalog is updated.  

The purpose of the resultant contract is to provide all U.S. Naval activities (defined as all U.S. Naval ashore and afloat units in the Hampton Roads Area and Elizabeth City NC Area) with a full range of quality items, at discount prices, with either customer pickup or delivery in accordance with the delivery schedules contained in the contract.  The supplies/equipment offered shall be of the type that is typically carried and offered in standard office, hardware, electrical, and restaurant supply warehouses and retail stores.  The Contractor is encouraged to add items to the list based upon its corporate capability.  However, all new items shall be reviewed by the COR/ACOR to ensure compliance with the performance statement of work prior to being added to the store or catalog. 

By entering into a contract, the U.S. Navy does not acquire, nor is it required to acquire, any item from the Contractor.  The purchase of supplies/equipment will only be made by the way of individual U.S. Government activity purchase orders, U.S. Government Credit Card purchases, or via FISC Norfolk or NAS Oceana delivery orders.  Sales are neither guaranteed nor promised under the contract.  Currently, at the Norfolk Super Servmart, the Virginia Industries for the Blind (VIB) are a subcontractor.  Offerors are encouraged to subcontract/partner with VIB.

The proposed acquisition is a follow-on effort to two current contracts: N00189-00-A-7018 (Norfolk Super Servmart administered by FISC Norfolk) and N00140-97C-0682 (Oceana Touch-N-Go Servmart administered by FISC Norfolk, Philadelphia Detachment), both of which are no cost contracts. An IDIQ type no cost contract will be utilized for a base year with the option to procure services for four additional one-year option periods.  The periods of performance for the Norfolk Super Servmart (approximate start date is mid-December 2002) are different from the Oceana Touch-N-Go Servmart (1 October 2002).  The minimum guarantee of $50,000.00 will be met by U.S. Government customers of both Servmarts placing orders via any of the methods mentioned above.  Currently, the annual sales have averaged $25M for the Norfolk Super Servmart and $3M for the Naval Air Station Oceana Touch-N-Go Servmart.  

The U.S. Government will provide the buildings and some maintenance services.  The Contractor will provide the necessary management, personnel furnishings, fixtures, equipment and supplies to operate the retail stores.  Supplies and equipment required to perform under this contract may include shelving, display cases, cash registers, point of sale system, material handling equipment (MHE), and battery charging stations if MHE is battery driven.  The Contractor shall be required to offer and distribute JWOD/UNICOR products and shall not offer for sale, commercial items that are identical or essentially the same as the JWOD/UNICOR items.  

The solicitation will contain clause 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services.  Solicitation issuance is anticipated as 03 June 2002 with a pre-proposal conference (date and exact location to be specified in the solicitation) to be held in Norfolk and Virginia Beach, Virginia. Offerors will be restricted to two representatives for the pre-proposal conference.    

Award will be based upon a best value evaluation of price, technical proposal and past performance.  In those instances of a large business proposal, the Small Business Subcontracting Plan will be evaluated for compliance with the solicitation provisions.

<DESC>THIS SOLICITATION IS ISSUED ON AN UNRESTRICTED BASIS, INVITING FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION. POC: Stephen L. Cannon, Contract Specialist, Code ACQ11.SC, Larry R. Fisk, Contracting Officer, Code ACQ11.  The Government will evaluate proposals using source selection procedures with the intent to award a firm-fixed price contract to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforms to the solicitation, as the BEST VALUE to the Government, price and technical factors considered. JOB DESCRIPTION: This quality of life project provides for the design and construction (Design/Build) of a 196-person dormitory at Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana. The work includes, but is not limited to, the demolition of the Base Exchange (BX), Building 4265 approximately 67,544 SF, (6,275 SM), and the construction of a new 196-person dormitory at Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana. Work includes all supporting utilities, site work, parking, and demolition of a segment of Douhet Drive. THE CONSTRUCTION SITE IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE AVAILABLE UNTIL FEBRUARY 2004 (TARGET DATE FOR THE NEW BX TO BE COMPLETED AND THE OLD BX TO BE VACATED).  THIS PROJECT WILL HAVE TWO PHASES: A DESIGN PHASE WHICH WILL BEGIN FROM DATE OF CONTRACT AWARD AND MAY LAST UNTIL FEBRUARY 2004; AND A CONSTRUCTION PHASE WHICH WOULD BE BASED ON A START DATE OF ON OR AROUND FEBRUARY 2004 AND PROVIDE A MAXIMUM CONSTRUCTION TIME OF FIFTEEN(15) MONTHS. Estimated cost for design and construction is between $9,500,000.00 and $10,500,000.00. The work includes the preparation of design and construction plans and specifications and all other related construction documents for approval by the Government for a complete and usable facility. The project shall be designed and constructed using Sustainable Design Principles and an integrated team approach to provide a facility that (a) optimizes energy efficiency on a life cycle cost basis; (b) promotes occupant productivity and health; (c) utilizes construction techniques and materials that promote resource conservation and environmental responsibility-durable, recyclable, recycled content, locally available, minimize construction waste, etc.  These principles are further explained in the Navy's WHOLE BUILDING DESIGN GUIDE, located at http://www.wbdg.org/index.asp (currently under development).
Proposals will be evaluated using two-phase source selection procedures that will result in award of a firm-fixed price contract to the responsible proposer whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is the BEST VALUE to the Government, price and technical factors considered. Phase I of the procurement process is a narrowing phase to approximately five (5) offerors (design-build firms or teams) based on equally weighted design-build factors that include: Past Performance, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, Technical Qualifications, and Management Approach.

<DESC>National Cancer Institute on behalf of the National Institute of Neurological Disorder and Stroke, Laboratory of Neural Control (LNC), proposes to enter into a sole source contract with RedShirtImaging, LLC, 2 Stoneleigh Road, Fairfield, CT 06432, for a NeuroCCD Imaging System.  Research in the Cellular and Systems Neurobiology Section (CCN) is devoted to understanding fundamental neurobiological mechanisms generating patterns of neural activity underlying breathing movements in the mammalian central nervous system.  The CSN research has important applications not only for advancing the understanding of neuron and neural network function in the mamalian brain, but also understanding neuropathological conditions resulting from disfunction of central nervous system respiratory networks. CNS major objective of this research is to determine the functional and structural properties of respiratory neurons and networks in the brainstem.  During the past five years, the CSN has developed imaging techniques that allow the activity of single neurons and populations of neurons to be visualized in real time with videomicroscopic imaging techniques applied to in vitro experimental preparations including brainstem slices isolated from the neonatal rodent nervous system.  These techniques have proven to be valuable for reconstructing patterns of activity of the in vitro respiratory network - an important step in understanding network function.  The imaging methodology employed utilizes staining of neurons with calcium-sensitive fluorescent dyes that change their fluorescence intensity when neurons become active and thereby emit optical signals that can detected with a photodetector, specifically a CCDcamera, in a video format for real-time visualization of neuronal calcium activity.  The CSN plans to utilize voltage-sensitive dyes that like the calcium dyes allow neuron and neuron population imaging in real time, but provide a much higher temporal resolution (msec resolution), thus overcoming limitations of the calcium dyes and associated imaging system.  In order for the CNS to utilize the voltage-sensitive dyes a new imaging system is required that has been optimzed for detection of the faster signals emitted by the voltage-sensitive dyes, which have fundamentally differenet systems requirements than the current system being utilzied for detection of calcium dye signals.  Specific requirements are: 1)low noise, cooled CCD camera for low signal detection; 2) optical signal transfer from the CD camera chip at rate substantially higher (up to 50 Hz) than ordinary video rate to achieve higher temporal resolution; 3) CCD camera system has appropriate spatial resolution for imaging populations of neurons that may be spatially distributed; 4) capability for control over the number of camera pixels utilized for optical data accumulation (advanced software system for automatic control of pixel number); 5) data transfer from the CCD camera can be gated by computer control of the camera (requiring advanced software); 6) system must be uniquely designed for the detection of optical signals from voltage-sensitive dyes.  Redshirtimaging LLC, is the only source known to the Government that can provide the above item with the required features.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the Government's requirements herein.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office no later than 1:30 PM EDT on September 12, 2002.  This action is pursuant to 41 USC 253(1) and under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  This requirement will be procured as a commercial item in accordance with FAR Part 12.  If you have any questions, please contact Cynthia Brown, Purchasing Agent, (301) 402-4509.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The NAICS Code: 334513 and the business size standard is 500 employees.

<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) intends to negotiate a purchase order on a sole source basis with Data Systems and Solutions, LLC (DS&S) for a licensing agreement for the Risk and Reliability Workstation (R&R) and related training sessions for use of the workstation.  The proposed period of performance is for a one-year base period and two one-year options.  The R&R Workstation, a real-time plant risk software package that runs on personal computers (PC) with Windows or NT platforms, is owned by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) and DS&S is the authorized dealer and provides technical support.  The R&R workstation enables the user to manage and evaluate risk data and to connect the various computer codes in use.  The NRC is developing various risk-based methodologies to support risk-informed regulatory applications using various computer codes, and the R&R Workstation is compatible with NRC's existing computer codes.  It is desirable to use this workstation to enhance the communicability with the utility licensee's since numerous U.S. utilities, international organizations, and vendors are members of the R&R workstation user's group and the workstation can be used with or in parallel with other codes and risk models.  The R&R Workstation is an open system and DS&S provides documentation and support to allow users to have the ability to enhance existing applications, and create new applications using individual built-in elements of the workstation functions.  These are the features other similar products or software packages do not have.  No other software package has this level of interconnectivity and widespread usage within the U.S. utility market.  It is also anticipated that three training sessions will be required for the first year and two sessions during the second year with options to provide additional training during the third year.  This action is being pursued on a sole source basis because DS&S is the lead contractor for EPRI and has commercialization rights for the R&R Workstation, including distribution to all non-EPRI members, and runs the user group and other support activities.  As the developer, DS&S is uniquely qualified to provide NRC the necessary training, as well as software development expertise to create and apply applications.  There is no other source authorized to distribute and support the R&R Workstation products.   This notice is not to be considered a request for quotations nor a solicitation for offers.  No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored.  Written responses should provide detailed evidence of the respondent's capability to provide the product and perform the required services and absence of organizational conflict of interest.

<SUBJECT>A -- International Cooperation on Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP)
<SOLNBR>S-LMAQM-02-R-114
<CONTACT>Tracy Ford, Contract Specialist, Phone 7038756747, Fax 7038756085, Email fordtr@state.gov - Colleen Kosar, Team Leader, Phone 7038756643, Fax 7038756085, Email kosarcm@state.gov
<DESC>Statement of Work (SOW)

1. Scope:  This project will focus on analytical support for the Department of State's efforts to expand international cooperation on CIP with allies and other key nations.  Specifically, it will entail supporting the Office of Plans, Policy and Analysis (PPA) within the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs (PM) in its role as policy development and implementing agent for CIP cooperation by conducting research and analytical support.

2. Background:  National infrastructures -- upon which U.S. national and economic security depend -- are increasingly linked by global telecommunications and computer networks, making it essential that the United States have an effective international outreach strategy for critical infrastructure protection.  Executive Order 13231, signed October 16, 2001, tasks the Department of State as the lead agency for foreign affairs with respect to critical information infrastructure protection (CIP).  The E.O. builds on the foundation of PDD-63, which mandated that there be a plan to expand international cooperation on CIP.  The Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security represents the Department at an interagency CIP Board, with the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs (PM) acting as the policy development and implementing agent.

International interest in CIP cooperation with the U.S. has grown substantially in recent years.  Furthermore, the U.S. is beginning to develop CIP outreach strategies towards nations that pose unique challenges to the U.S.  Additional resources are necessary identify appropriate international partners and to develop specific outreach strategies for new partners.  Given other requirements and staffing shortfalls, the PM Bureau, and PPA more specifically, does not have sufficient personnel or regional expertise to perform all of the necessary research and analytical support that will be necessary in the coming years for the government?s mandated CIP outreach policy.  A contractor will assist in fulfilling the goals of the outreach policy and with developing strategies to respond to burgeoning international interest in CIP.

3. Tasks:

The following tasks may be requested of the contractor:
 
&#61623; Identify key U.S. concerns about and potential collaborative activities with the Republic of Korea and Brazil in the realm of CIP.
&#61623; Perform as and when directed the following analysis for the Republic of Korea, Brazil, and other nations identified as having priority, including Eastern European and Middle Eastern nations:
&#61623; Identify key pressure points within the foreign government and analyze foreign concerns and bureaucratic attitudes on CIP issues.
&#61623; Develop strategies for approaching the respective foreign government that are likely to yield positive responses to U.S. concerns.
&#61623; Coordinate and support, as directed, follow-up activities to ongoing U.S. bilateral and multilateral CIP consultations.

4. Deliverables:

The following deliverables shall be required of the contractor:

Quarterly Progress Reports: The contractor shall submit quarterly reports describing progress made on the tasks listed above and anticipated work to be performed in the next quarter.

Monthly Invoices:  The contractor shall submit monthly invoices to the NP-AC-PM-VC/EX budget office.

5. Security Classification:  The work will require access to material classified at the TOP SECRET level.  Contractor employees assigned to this project must have current security clearances at or above the TOP SECRET level at the time of award. The contractor must also possess a facility capable of producing, transmitting and storing classified material up to the level of SECRET.

6. Location of Work:  The contractor shall conduct some work out of its office but must be available to work or conduct consultations in Washington, DC on a regular basis on short notice and be available for other travel as required to complete the tasks in the SOW.  Travel and per diem expenses for such travel and consultations shall be covered under this contract.

7. Period of Performance:  This contract will include a one-year base performance period and two option year performance periods, with the Department retaining the sole right to exercise the option years.  The period of performance for the base year and subsequent option years, if exercised, shall not exceed three years.

8. Special Requirements:  Fulfillment of the work outlined in this SOW will require the contractor to possess unique attributes and capabilities.  These include, but are not limited to, the following:

&#61623; Direct knowledge of and extensive experience with the workings of the U.S. Department of State and the U.S. interagency.
&#61623; Familiarity with ongoing Department of State operations and a clear understanding of the Department?s mission, role with respect to other USG departments and agencies, and methods of conducting bilateral consultations. 
&#61623; A demonstrated capacity to work effectively in the U.S. interagency environment.
&#61623; Direct knowledge of and extensive experience with designing strategies and plans for bilateral and multilateral outreach and cooperation programs with a variety of foreign governments.
&#61623; A direct knowledge of and experience with analyzing emerging security issues including CIP.
&#61623; An up-to-date and well-informed knowledge of East Asian and Eastern European foreign and security policy concerns, including concerns about emerging issues such as CIP, and the strategic drivers that inform them and a demonstrated capacity to analyze those policies and produce policy recommendations.

9. Basis for Contractor Selection:  The contractor shall be selected based upon the Department of State?s conclusions as to which of the alternate contractors would provide best value to the Department in performing the work outlined in this SOW.  The criteria for best value shall include, but not be limited to, the following:

&#61623; Degree of compliance with the special requirements of the SOW as outlined in Section 6.
&#61623; Past performance on contracts requiring tasks similar to those outlined in this SOW. 
&#61623; Qualifications of contractor personnel to perform the required work.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The factors identified below, the first being significantly more important than factor (ii) and (iii) which are of equal importance to one another. (i) FACTOR 1: PRICE.  The price factor will be evaluated for fairness and reasonableness and to the extent to which the proposed labor rates meet AFRL/IF's goal of obtaining qualified technical and professional services at the most affordable price possible. Fairness and Reasonableness - the degree to which proposed price compares to the price reasonable and prudent person would expect to incur for the same or similar goods or services. (ii) FACTOR 2: PAST PERFORMANCE.  The extent to which the Offeror's past performance met customer requirements, including the Offeror's history of controlling costs, adhering to schedules (including the administrative aspect of performance), reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction, and generally the Offeror's business-like concern for the interests of the customer.

The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the Government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the service described in this RFP, based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance.  The assessment process will result in an overall risk rating of exceptional, very good, satisfactory, neutral, marginal, or unsatisfactory.  Offerors with no relevant past performance history shall receive the rating "neutral", meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. (iii) FACTOR 3: PROGRAM MANAGEMENT. The extent to which the Offeror is able to manage the effort so that the required tasks, as outlined in the Statement of Scope and resulting Statements of Work for each order, are performed by qualified personnel.

<DESC>The following questions, received in response to Request for Quotation M00146-02-Q-9020, and the Government responses are hereby provided for your information:  1) Of the 36 single and 75 two seat canopies to be cleaned, what has been the minimum and average number of canopies cleaned per order / event?  Answer:  The number of canopies per quarter is estimated at 25-30.   
2)  What is the average frequency per aircraft on which the requirement is based? For instance, is it once a year for 111 separate aircraft, once every three months for 34 aircraft, or once a month for 18 aircraft? Answer:  It is anticipated that each of the 111 aircraft will require refurbishment at least once per year. 3) Will the canopy cleaning be accomplished during regularly scheduled maintenance, or on a call-when-needed basis? 
Answer:  The maintenance will be scheduled once per quarter.      
4)  Regarding the three (3) hour completion requirement, how much advanced notice will normally be given by the MALS to the contractor?  Answer:  The quarterly maintenance will be scheduled in advance.  The movement of the aircraft during this time will be coordinated between the government and the contractor.  The three (3) hours completion time required for each aircraft will begin once the government turns the aircraft over to the contractor.  5)  Are there proposed/preferred hours of service and availability, like 7 am to 3pm (Monday to Friday) or 24 /7?  
 Answer:  To avoid conflict with aircraft flight schedules, the contractor will be required to perform refurbishment of approximately 75% of the canopies after 4:30 p.m.  Weekend performance will not be required, but will be allowed at the contractor's request.  7)  The solicitation indicates that a Secret Clearance will NOT be required.  What level security clearance would be required of contractor personnel?  In the event that contractors submit personnel who have not been previously cleared, will an approved escort be provided during the interim period between submission of clearance documents and final approval?  Answer:  Employees performing under this contract shall be required to obtain a standard visitor pass from Provost Marshall Office.  Note:  The closing date for receipt of proposals in response to this solicitation has been extended to 26 April 2002.

********DUPLICATED REFER TO NCI-20140-NQ******************
The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Cancer Prevention Studies Branch (CPSB), Center for Cancer Research (CCR) intends on entering into a sole source contract with New York University, School of Medicine, 550 First Avenue, OVB-Admin 606, New York, NY 10016.  The CPSB requires the purchase of data on serum IgG antiboides to whole-cell H. Pylori and the CagA antigen in cases of upper GI cancers and control, as to determine the association of the presence of H. Pylori and subsequent development of upper GI cancers.  CPSB/CCR conducts research in areas related to cancer prevention aimed at lowering human cancer risk.  Gastric and esophageal cancers, are the second and the eighth most common cancers in the world.  Linxian, China, has some of the highest rates of esophageal cancer in the world as well as cardia cancer, the age-standardized incidence rate for cancer is approximately 130/100,000 nearly 30 fold higher than the rate observed in the U.S.  Previous studies conducted by CPSB examined the association of H. Pylori with subsequent risk of cancers of the cardia and the body of the stomach, these associations have remained controversial, due to small sample sizes in previous studies.  These studies were done by Dr. Blaser's lab at New York University and is essential that the results of this study be comparable to the previous study to have sound scientific overall results.  NCI plans on conducting a large and definitive study, examining the association of H. Pylori and the risk of upper GI cancers.  This study will have a great impact on the treatment of patients infected with H. Pylori, a bacterium that infects about half of the world's population.  This study is part of a larger research program between China and the U.S., whose overall goal is to try to determine optimal strategies for the prevention and early detection of upper GI cancers in both China and U.S. The New York Uniersity School of Medicine is the only source known to the Government that can provide the above requriements specified.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the Government needs.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office no later than September 19, 2002.  This action is pursuant to 41 USC 253(1) and under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  The requrement will be procured as a non-commercial item in accordance with FAR Part 13 and FAR clause 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services.  If you have any questions, please contact Cynthia Brown, Purchasing Agent (301) 402-4509.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  The NAICS Code: 541990, and the business size standard is $6.0 million.

<DESC>2nd Round of Questions and Responses to RFP (NAMA-02-R-0009) 
FileNet or Equivalent 
 

QUESTION #1:

In the bottom of the SOW there is reference made to staffing for the project. It stipulates that three points of contact from the Vendor need to be included on the project team. The question I have is does this mean that the company who wins the award needs to have those people currently employed or that the Software vendor needs to have their staff included with the awardees? In other words if FileNet was selected as the best WCM solution would Filenet staff have to be included on our RFQ response as part if our team?

RESPONSE:

If FileNet (or equivalent product) is selected as the best WCM solution, NARA requires that the contractor staff shall have participated in at least two complete implementations of FileNet (or equivalent product). The FileNet (or equivalent product) staff will also have to be included in the contractors response as a part of its team.

<DESC>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) hereby issues a Request for Information (RFI) to identify sources with: (1) professional and creative conference planning teams to help design and plan the DISA Annual Customer Conference to be held on March 24-27, 2003 and (2) to identify Conference facilities that will meet DISA's requirements. 

This announcement is an RFI only, and not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  When there is any further development in the project, a formal RFP may be issued.

This RFI is a request for interested parties that may be able to provide the required conference planning/conference facilities for the DISA Customer Advocacy (CA) Directorate, to describe their capabilities to respond to the requirements described below and provide a rough-order-of-magnitude (ROM) cost for such services.  Industry responses will be used by the Government to assess feasibility, technical solutions and acquisition approaches to be used in the DISA Annual Customer Conference.

Interested parties responding to this RFI are invited to prepare a white paper and address suggestions to perform the tasks identified, NLT 18 September 2002.  All comments and suggestions are welcome.  Sources submitting a white paper who are interested in making a maximum 1-hour presentation (open forum) should contact Ms. Tannikka Richardson at (703) 882-1924 and/or Ms. Irene Ivone at (703) 882-0926 to make arrangements.  Meetings will be scheduled during 24-30 September 2002.

This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for information received in responses.  The point of contact (POC) for technical issues is Ms. Irene Ivone, DISA, CA at (703) 882-0926.  The POC for contractual issues is Mr. Anthony Carlisi, Contracting Officer, at (703) 681-0929. 

Responses to this RFI are to be sent to the contracting office at DISA/AQN3 Contracts, 5111 Leesburg Pike, Suite 900A, Falls Church, VA 22041, Attn: Anthony Carlisi, and should include an original and one (1) copy plus either one (1) 3.25" high-density disk using MS Word 7.0, or sent electronically to Mr. Carlisi's email address at Carlisia@ncr.disa.mil.  Email attachments must be virus free, and there must be a positive statement included in the email text to that effect.  Respondents must include the Company Name, Street Address, City, State, NINE-digit zip code, Point of Contact (POC), POC telephone, email and facsimile address, Company Size and Status.  If the company address includes a post office box, the complete address must also be provided.  Proprietary information should be identified as such.  

Interested Parties should include the following:

A discussion of past performance detailing previous accomplishments and work in this area.  Please include POC information.

A discussion of the overall approach to the management of this proposed effort, including brief discussions of the total organization, project, function, subcontractor relationships, planning, scheduling and control practices.

The technical areas of support are described below:

Background: The DISA Customer Partnership Conference was last held on July 30- August 1, 2002 at the Hilton Alexandria Mark Center in Alexandria, VA.  There were approximately 567 participants, but 635 registrants.  The theme of the conference was DoD Enterprise, Building the Vision - Together.

The team to be selected should be prepared to design a conference experience that attendees will have by providing 1) complete creative support including theme and slogan design, formation of an appropriate marketing strategy, video script/treatment development and subsequent production, and speech writing; 2) registration support and badge printing; 3) funds management to include conference fee collection, database and query design, creation of a tapered registration fee structure, funds disbursement and sufficient knowledge to generate ongoing financial reports; 4) audio-visual/technical support and facilitation of equipment rental; and 5) overall coordination support such as agenda creation, guest speaker coordination and room layout plans for main ballroom sessions, demonstrations, security, interactive sub-conferences and other miscellaneous conference activities.

In addition, it is expected that the selected team be able to create a sufficient staff to allow immediate response to accommodate questions, issues, and need for briefings and/or the creation/revision of briefing charts and be experienced in and familiar with:

	Project management tenets, generating project progress reports, and facilitating interactivity with any subcontractor input/resources related to a major event,
	Government contracting processes and all forms of documentation used for such processes,
	Performing market surveys to poll a sufficient number of different locations to host a conference and to provide the selection criteria analysis to select the top candidates to handle the specified meeting space, lodging, and parking requirements,
	Business transactions with major hotel/convention organizations,
	Statement of Work documents used by the government in creating contractual arrangements, and
	Creating meeting space graphics/drawings to facilitate conference activity planning and to have these products available for use in MS PowerPoint format as necessary.  These products need to be generated using a graphics software package that will allow printing in a large blueprint format.

It is imperative that the selected team be knowledgeable of and have extensive experience working within Federal Government/Department of Defense policies and restrictions.

<DESC>NASA/JSC is hereby soliciting information for potential sources for the Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Systems Contract.  This effort was previously announced in the International Space Station (ISS) Integration and Control Contract Strategy Request for Information synopsis 9-BG-12-2-69P, in March 2002.  The contract strategy package was updated and forwarded to industry through the internet in June 2002.  The URL for the location of the ISS Integration and Control Contract Strategy package is	     http://jsc-web-pub.jsc.nasa.gov/bd01/excellent-strategy/=09=20=20= =20   .   The EVA Systems procurement has recently been disengaged from the ISS Integration and Control Strategy.   The effort for the consolidated Extra Vehicular Activity (EVA) Systems contract is contemplated to encompass, in phased increments over the life of the contract, the development, sustaining engineering, and processing of EVA Hardware plus the integration of EVA requirements.  This contract will support the EVA requirements for the Space Shuttle Program (SSP) and the International Space Station Program (ISS), including activities within those programs involving payloads and international partners. This contract will also support EVA hardware research and development that is consistent with NASA's vision and mission statement.  In addition, this contract is contemplated to encompass the management of Neutral Buoyancy Lab (NBL) activities supporting EVA training and development.  The NBL scope of work will be included as an option under this contract, which will provide a contracting mechanism for exercise at an appropriate time during the contract period of performance, which will be no earlier than 2 years after award of the NBL Operations contract (currently being competed) or no later than 5 years after the award.   This contemplated effort is planned to represent a consolidation of the EVA portions of the following contracts:  the Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) EVA contract (NAS 9-97150), the Neutral Buoyancy Lab (NBL) portion of the NBL/Spacecraft Vehicle Mockup Facility (SVMF) contract, the Space Flight Operations Contract - Flight Crew Equipment (SFOC-FCE) (NAS 9-20000), and the Science Engineering Analysis and Test contract (SEAT) (NAS 9-19100).	 For the purposes of this contemplated effort, the term "EVA Hardware" includes all items, software, or devices that can be used to support EVA flight and training events.   The term EVA hardware includes all Class I (flight), Class II (qualification), Class III (training) and NBL training hardware.

<DESC>Research and development sources are sought for the Air Force Research Laboratory?s (AFRL?s) Directed Energy (DE) Directorate?s Satellite Assessment Center (SatAC).  SatAC is the Air Force-chartered organization that evaluates directed energy effects on space systems and performs assessments of space system susceptibilities to directed energy sources for the Department of Defense (reference DoD Instruction 3100.11) and develops tools to perform satellite and space systems technical analyses.  Space systems are defined to include satellites, missiles (tactical and ballistic), and the respective supporting architectures.   To support this objective, SatAC is interested in augmenting their technical and engineering expertise in the following major areas, to be performed on-site at the Air Force Research Laboratory,  Kirtland AFB, NM, and at contractors' facilities, and at third-party facilities:  (A) Gathering / Analyzing / Modeling Information; (B) System Assessments; (C) Computer Science Support.  Descriptions of each of these major areas follows:  (A) Gathering / Analyzing / Modeling Information includes obtaining, analyzing, and utilizing information in order to develop detailed system structural and functional models.  (B) Space system assessments are physics-based and include interactions with space weather, laser, radio frequency, high-power microwave, and other directed energy mechanisms from ground, air, space, or other emission sources.  Assessments include vulnerability analysis, astrodynamics, and other relevant aspects of system-level analyses.  (C) Computer Science Support encompasses development and use of software and databases to support system modeling, system assessment, assessment methodology automation, smart data fusion techniques and methods as applied to:   Space Situational Awareness (SSA), databases (multi-tier and relational), artificial intelligence, and automated tools/graphical user interfaces (GUIs) delivered to operational DoD customers.

diversity.  Envirtue Biotechnologies has developed a proprietary system
for the analysis of environmental samples to determine physical and
biological stressors in plants and animals.  This system, the
environmental Molecular Diagnostic System (EMDS) is a patent pending
approach that for the first time integrates cellar and molecular biology
that for the first time integrates cellular and molecular biology with
ecology and environmental science.  EMDS examines the health of an
organism by detecting changes at the molecular and cellular levels that
reflect responses of known physiological significance.  EMDS system can
detect the presence and concentration of specific proteins and cellular
molecules that are physiologically relevant to the health of a
particular organism.  This is a simplified acquisition with an estimated
value of less than $100,000.
