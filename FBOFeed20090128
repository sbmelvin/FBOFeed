<DESC><p>The NATO Communication and Information Systems Services Agency (NCSA) intends to advertise for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on works and services within the framework of the NATO Military Budget Committee (MBC). Eligible firms will be invited to bid on the provision of consultant services in support of the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) Installation Engineering Management System (IEMS) during the period mid-2009 through 2012 (i.e., six-month base contract plus three one-year options).</p>
<p>NCSA is serving as the contracting agency for this project, which was authorized by the MBC. NCSA intends to use the two envelope bid procedure. Partial bidding is authorized.</p>
<p>U.S. firms that have been pre-approved for participation in NATO International Competitive Bidding (ICB) and that have a demonstrated capability are considered eligible.</p>
<p>The Invitation for International Bid (IFIB) package will contain material at the level of NATO UNCLASSIFIED.</p>
<p>The estimated value of this project is not available at this time. The reference for this project is IFIB-NCSA-NCHQ-09-001 and all correspondence in relation to this procurement shall refer to this reference. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the same reference.</p>
<p>SCOPE OF PROJECT</p>
<p>The requirement is for the provision of consultants to support the SHAPE HSG S4 Engineer Branch in the management of the IEMS. The IEMS contains essential management information: budgetary, financial, contract, work scheduling, timekeeping of S4 LWR personnel, warehousing, and daily administrative functions.</p>
<p>Total estimated annual man-days are the following:</p>
<p>- One Oracle database specialist: 220 work days</p>
<p>- One level 1 ADP computer Helpdesk specialist: 220 work days</p>
<p>As technical personnel (SHAPE S4 LWR) use only the French language, the Helpdesk specialist must have adequate knowledge of the French language (i.e., at the minimum level "Good (Minimum Professional)" (Knowledge level as per STANAG 6001 last edition: PLS 3333)</p>
<p>The services shall be rendered by consultants in possession of a valid NATO SECRET clearance. The contractor is responsible for ensuring that the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) forwards to the NATO contracting agency the NATO clearance certifications needed for performance of the contract.</p>
<p>BIDDING PROCEDURE</p>

<DESC>Subsonic Aerial Target (SSAT)

The United States Navy has a requirement for a cost effective aerial target system to represent subsonic anti-ship cruise missile threats and air platforms. The Subsonic Aerial Target (SSAT) System will be used to support developmental and operational testing of naval combat systems while providing services in support of advanced fleet training. 

The SSAT will be a .90 to .95 Mach capable, recoverable subsonic aerial target vehicle capable of realistically representing enemy threats that operate in the high subsonic regime. The SSAT will be capable of being launched from ashore, at sea or by air and will be remotely controlled utilizing the System for Navy Target Control (SNTC). 

The Navy is considering making a competitive solicitation for the limited development and refinement of an existing target system to achieve Navy requirements to facilitate follow-on production. This late-stage Engineering & Manufacturing Development (EMD) effort is envisioned to commence in the FY-10 timeframe. Follow-on production is desired in FY-12. Production is currently envisioned to cover a fifteen year period at a rate of approximately 45 or more vehicles per year.

Per the SSAT FedBizOpps announcement on 13 January 2009, the United States Navy stated its plans to update the 16 October 2008 released draft Request for Proposal (RFP) in consideration of additional requirements.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<a href="mailto:elaine.m.vandiver@usace.army.mil">US Army Engineer District, Walla Walla</a>
<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK<BR><BR>GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF WORK <BR><BR>A.	Contractor will provide all labor and materials to carry out the slashing of over-mature vegetation on 37.5 acres of Corps of Engineers (Corps) managed lands as described below. <BR><BR>B.	The contractor will perform slashing treatment in two units within the Elk Creek Meadows area (totaling 37.5 acres). A vicinity map and a site map are attached.<BR><BR>C.	The work will be performed within the following dates: March 30, 2009, through May 15, 2009. This window is set such that the work is conducted soon after snowmelt, which is ideal for browse rejuvenation.<BR><BR>D.	A tour of the work sites will be conducted by Government personnel (date TBD), starting at the Dworshak Dam Natural Resource Building, located on the south end of the dam. All prospective bidders are strongly encouraged to attend the tour, as site conditions this year are substantially different from previous years. <BR><BR>1	SPECIFICATIONS<BR><BR>1.1	Method<BR><BR>Due to the fairly steep and rugged terrain, methods for accomplishing this work are expected to be limited to hand tools (e.g., mechanical and manual clippers, and chainsaws). Therefore hand-slashing is the approved method for accomplishing the work. We recognize that there may be alternative methods to accomplishing this work. The contractor may request approval through the Contracting Officers Representative (COR) to utilize other methods. In the event alternative methods are approved, all performance specifications remain the same and appropriate safety and environmental considerations will be applied.<BR><BR>1.2	Performance Specifications<BR><BR>The contractor will hand-cut trees and shrubs and reduce debris within the treatment units depicted on the attached map and in accordance with the following specifications:<BR>	<BR>(1)	All deciduous trees and shrubs from 1/4 inch to 6 inch in diameter, measured at one foot above the base, are to be cut to a height of approximately two feet.<BR><BR>(2)	All conifer trees less than 6 inches dbh (diameter at breast height) are to be cut at or near ground level.<BR><BR>(3)	Slashing debris (tree and shrub pieces separated from the base after cutting) will be reduced to lengths less than 72 inches and the depth of debris will not exceed 24 inches above the ground surface.<BR><BR>(4)	All slashing debris that lands on a road surface will be removed from the road surface.<BR><BR>(5)	The contractor is not to cut down any deciduous trees and shrubs nor conifers trees within 50 feet of any swamps, bogs, wetlands, lakes, or any permanent or temporary streams; this includes the Reservoir itself. Temporary streams can be identified by the occurrence of a definite bed and bank.<BR><BR>1.3	Area Description and Access<BR><BR>The terrain of the Elk Creek Meadows area varies between gently sloped to fairly steep. The slashing units have recently been logged using tractor or cable yarding methods. As a result the amount of vegetation to be slashed per acre within the units is much less then in previous years. Therefore it is very important to attend the site tour in order to adequately determine cost per acre. <BR><BR>The site can be accessed by either boat or vehicle. However, accessing the units by passenger vehicle will require crossing land owned by Potlatch Corporation, the Idaho Department of Lands and other private landowners. If the contractor wishes to access the units by passenger vehicle he/she must get permission and obtain keys from these owners. It shall be the responsibility of the contractor to obtain permission to utilize roads not owned by the Corps. The Corps is not responsible for providing access to the site via road. <BR><BR>1.4 Pre-work Meeting<BR><BR>The contractor shall meet with the point of contact (POC) at the Dworshak Natural Resources Office, (208) 476-1203, prior to beginning work. The purpose of this meeting is to discuss and develop mutual understandings relative to the general, technical, and safety aspects of the work to be completed as well as establishing a quality control program and schedule of work.<BR><BR>1.5 Contractor Quality Control Program<BR><BR>The Quality Control Program is the means by which the Contractor assures himself or herself and the COR that all work will be accomplished in accordance with the contract specifications. The Contractors Quality Control Program shall be prepared in advance of the start of work and provide for all services in the contract. It shall include the surveillance required to meet all contract specifications regarding schedule, compliance, proper equipment, materials, and work performance. The Contractor shall be responsible for controlling work quality through effective management, training, and sufficient inspections of all work items (including those of subcontractors) to ensure compliance with all contract requirements. The contractor may be required to produce his/her written quality control program at any time during the course of the contract.<BR><BR>1.6 Government Quality Assurance<BR><BR>1.6.1 Inspections. The Government has the right to inspect all work called for in this contract, to the extent practical, at all times and places during the terms of the contract. The Government will perform perodic inspections in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. The Government will perform such additional inspections of materials, procedures, equipment, and completed work as considered necessary by the COR to ensure contract compliance.<BR><BR>1.6.2 Quality Assurance Representative. The COR may designate a Quality Assurance Representative (QAR) to inspect the Contractors performance. Neither the QAR nor COR are authorized to change the scope of work of the specifications without written authorization from the Contracting Officer. Neither the presence nor absence of a QAR will relieve the Contractor from any requirement of the contract. The QAR will observe and report to the COR the Contractors activities and compliance with contract specifications. A QAR has the authority to require work to be done in accordance with contract requirements and to stop the Contractors operation for violations of safety requirements or when life is endangered.<BR><BR>1.6.3	Performance Requirements Summary. Following the completion of the work, Corps staff will inspect each unit for compliance with this Statement of Work using the criteria below. These criteria must be met to satisfy the intent of the contract. Random sampling may be used to determine compliance.<BR><BR>(1)	Ninety percent of all deciduous trees and shrubs (1/2 inch to 6 inches in diameter as measured at the one foot above ground level) are to be cut to a height of 1-1/2 feet to 2-1/2 feet above ground level. <BR><BR>(2)	The number of deciduous slash pieces longer than 72 inches in length will not exceed 10 per acre.<BR><BR>(3)	Ninety percent of the 37.5 acres will not have slash extending beyond 24 inches above the ground.<BR><BR>(4)	The number of conifer stumps greater than 6 inches above the ground surface will not exceed five (5) per acre.<BR><BR>1.6.4 Discrepancies. If the findings of any given inspection demonstrate that the work does not comply with the Performance Requirements Summary, the Government may require the Contractor to correct the deficient work at no cost to the Government. A written notice of discrepancies to be corrected will be given to the Contractor or his or her representative. The contractor shall have seven (7) days from the date of a written notice of discrepancies in which to furnish satisfactory written justification for the discrepancies and/or bring the work into compliance.<BR><BR>1.6.5 Contractors Nonperformance. If the Contractor fails to perform the work in the specified timeframe or fails to meet contract specifications and fails to take necessary action to ensure future performance is in conformity with contract requirements, the Government may terminate the contract for cause (see FAR 52.212-4(m)).<BR><BR>1.7 Subcontracting<BR><BR>No work may be subcontracted without the written approval of the Contracting Officer. Compliance with the provisions of this contract by subcontractors shall be the responsibility of the Contractor.<BR><BR>1.8 Permits and Responsibilities<BR><BR>The Contractor shall, without additional expense to the Government, be responsible for obtaining all necessary licenses and permits and for complying with any applicable Federal, State, and municipal laws, codes, and regulations in connection with the performance of this work.<BR><BR>1.9 Protection of Resources<BR><BR>1.9.1 Protection of Government Facilities. The Contractor shall be responsible for restoring any Government facilities, structures, or equipment damaged as a result of his/her operations. Reasonable care shall be used to avoid damage to existing structures, equipment, and vegetation in the area and other areas of Government property.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a sources sought synopsis for writteninformation only.  This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and nocontract will be awarded from this announcement.  
The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center, Norfolk, Virginia is seeking forinformation and planning purposes, qualified and experienced sources for afeasibility study relating to the standardization of Lab Management softwaresuite across the entire DOD Optical Enterprise.
The Naval Ophthalmic Support and Training Activity, Yorktown, Virginia isresponsible for improving and standardizing optical fabrication servicesthroughout the Department of Defense (DOD).  The DOD Optical FabricationEnterprise (OFE) is a Tri-service entity consisting of 26 labs world-wide,providing optical fabrication support for the Armed Forces and other federalagencies.  The OFE's mission is to provide key elements of vision readiness andoptical support to the Armed Forces of the United States.  These elementsinclude the manufacturing of eyeglasses, protective mask inserts and specialtylenses.  The OFE currently fills over 1.2 million prescriptions for eyewear peryear.
The DoD Optical Fabrication Enterprise (OFE) is performing a feasibility studyrelating to the standardization of Lab Management Software suite (LMS) acrossthe entire DoD Optical Enterprise.  The primary focus of the study is todetermine if a single vendor can provide a standardized Lab Management Software(LMS) suite across the OFE in an effort to streamline processes and to improvethe OFE's vision for improving customer service.
This study will encompass the development, deployment, timelines, and support ofan automated optical fabrication management system for the OFE.  Key features ofOFAMS involve integration and interfaces with current SRTS legacy and theplanned SRTS2/AHLTA DoD electronic eyeglass order entry and order managementsystem, logistic (DMLSS), and a wide variety of OFE operated equipment (Blocker,generator, edger, etc.) and allow for an optical order to be received from anexternal customer, validated, tracked, calculated, manufactured, verified, andshipped to an external customer.
Standardizing the OFE LMS suites will enhance the optical device order entry andtracking systems currently in place.  Key enhancements include:.	Detailed job tracking that allows users to know current and paststatuses of the job as well as who was involved in key fabrication steps and theequipment used during fabrication..	Integration/interfaces with internal and external DoD applications toupdate job statuses, initiate inventory management, perform order validation anderror identification, and share key order information..	Highly granular and highly detailed user friendly reporting functions toprovide metrics, alerts and other user defined reports in common exportableformats; such as Excel, CVS, delimited, SQL, Crystal Reports, etc..	Barcode and other job identification and tracking such as RFID functionsto minimize keystrokes..	Integration with user defined optical fabrication related equipment toallow for two-way information exchange required for fabrication, tracking, andquality verification..	Inventory verification to ensure material pulled for each job iscorrect..	A graphical user interface (GUI) that is highly configurable by the userto allow for all current and past jobs to be identified and recalled accordingto user defined sorts.  This master order management screen allows the user toview all or specific subsets of jobs and recall a complete history for each jobas needed.  Alerts for key user defined situations that are integrated into theorder management screen..	Comply with applicable MHS AIS security, patient privacy and datatransmission requirements.	Help desk and system change request process for ongoing systemmaintenance and enhancements
Interested sources are invited to respond to this sources sought synopsis bysubmitting a technical proposal and cost proposal for their system.  A list oftheir system's capabilities, standards compliance, interoperability withrobotics and automation equipment.  If feasible, a demonstration video, computeranimation or screenshots of their LMS suite's user interface should be provided.Some areas to consider: Design, Development, Customization per lab (26 labsworld-wide), Graphical User Interface (Required), Support, Maintenance,Upgrades, Security, Fault Tolerance, Metrics, Granular & Custom Reporting, RFIDTracking, Shipping, Single-Vision, Multi-Vision, Progressives, Facilities,Manpower, Interfaces, Data Flow, HIPPA, Privacy Act, System Hardware.  Responsesshould be e-mailed to both Patty Black at patricia.black@med.navy.mil and toMaria Swift at maria.swift@navy.mil by 27 February 2009 at 4:30 p.m. EST.  Thisis not a request for proposal.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of State Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs Office of Aviation (INL/A) is seeking capable offerors who can perform UH-1 depot level maintenance (PDM) and UH-1H Aircraft Retrofit (Bell Huey II conversion) and avionics upgrade.  

During this market research segment, INL/A will be seeking industry input on draft solicitation documents which will be released in the near future.  It is anticipated that any contracts resulting from this action will be awarded in the forth quarter of FY2009 and may also contain requirements for other US Agencies.  

We anticipate awarding multiple indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contracts for five to seven aircraft per year for five years. In general the contracts will be for 1. Huey II Conversion, 2. Huey II Depot/Crash Damage Repair, 3. UH1N Retrofit and 4. UH1N Depot/Crash Damage Repair.  We expect these contracts will be hybrid firm fix priced contracts with cost reimbursable elements containing incentives for cost, quality, and schedule.

The successful contractor shall use project and quality management processes which meet or exceed ISO-9000, AS9100, or equivalent and which include, but not limited to: earned value management, an integrated master schedule, risk management, and continuous improvement of cost, schedule and/or quality performance.

All work is to be accomplished in accordance with applicable original equipment manufacturer (OEM), military or FAA specifications and standards.

Depot Maintenance:  Programmed depot maintenance is required in accordance with the INL Critical Flight Safety Program (CFSP) on a five year recurring basis for each of our UH-1 variants including UH-1H, UH1H II (Huey II), and UH-1N helicopters.  These aircraft are currently located in Afghanistan, Bolivia, Colombia, Pakistan, Peru, Guatemala, and at Patrick AFB, Florida.  The best value approach will be utilized as to where PDM maintenance will be performed. This could be at a facility near where the aircraft are currently located or performed by field teams at government provided facilities.  Industry should consider all technical solutions.

UH-1H conversion to Huey II and Avionics Upgrade: the USG will provide the contractor as government furnished equipment (GFE) with former US Army 1962 to 1974 year model UH-1H helicopters and Honeywell T53-L-703 engines.

<DESC>Please note that the point of contact for all questions concerning this announcement is Carolyn Weikert at 732-532-6135.  Product Director, Target Identification and Meteorological Sensors (PD TIMS) is performing a market survey for sources interested in providing Research, Development Test & Evaluation (RDT&E) support for the program Block II upgrade and integration for the U.S. Army. The program effort will focus on Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) in a post Milestone B program culminating in a successful Milestone C decision for follow on Production and Deployment.<BR><BR>The current Profiler Block I system is hosted in either a Standard Integrated Command Post System (SICPS) or Command Post Platform (CPP) shelter mounted on a High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) and processes weather data from a balloon radiosonde subsystem, a local ground sensor and a Tactical-Very Small Aperture Terminal (T-VSAT) satellite subsystem. The satellite subsystem allows for download of the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA) model initialization data and provides updates of new weather sensor data as it becomes available, thus allowing the model to continuously adjust to changing weather. The Global Broadcast Service (GBS) will replace T-VSAT.<BR><BR>A primary focus of the Block II integration effort is to increase accuracy of MET messages by improving software models, sensors and initialization data, while removing the balloon radiosonde subsystem. A study/survey of weather sensor technologies and products will be performed to address the feasibility of replacing the local Tactical Meteorological Equipment (TACMET) sensor with new sensor(s). The study should also address other US Army weather sensors and/or data that are intrinsic to other battlefield systems that can be utilized by Profiler. A new hardware configuration will be developed that will address the upgrade, elimination and/or consolidation of Line Replaceable Units (LRUs), to include a new onboard power design. The satellite subsystem will be enhanced, to include Size, Weight, Power and Cost (SWaP-C) improvements, to decrease emplacement time (auto-acquire) to support on-the-move capability. The GBS implementation is not in the scope of this effort. The application and modeling software will be upgraded. Knowledge of the NCAR/Penn State Mesoscale Model (MM5) and similar models is necessary. The system platform and/or shelter may change and the design will address system portability and ability to operate in a Tactical Operations Center (TOC). Additionally, the Profiler may have an interface to a tactical Local Area Network (LAN) which will provide alternate communication capabilities that can be exploited for model initialization and message communication. Security and Information Assurance (IA) issues need to be understood and addressed. A formal test program will be required to support software Formal Qualification Test (FQT), transportability, environmental, survivability, Reliability, Availability and Maintainability (RAM), safety and performance requirements. EMD systems will be produced to support a Limited User Test (LUT). Logistics implications need to be considered since these systems may be eventually fielded after the RDT&E effort.<BR><BR>The RDT&E Effort is expected to commence in early FY10 and last for three (3) years.<BR> <BR>Responses should include relevant company qualifications in successfully supporting and executing such a program. In particular, knowledge, capability and experience in the following areas are of greatest interest to PD TIMS:<BR><BR>1. Meteorological sensors, technologies and models<BR>2. Systems engineering and integration<BR>3. Software development<BR>4. Test and Evaluation<BR>5. Security and IA<BR>6. Production facilities.<BR><BR>Companies should present their responses in the form of a whitepaper no more than 15 pages in length describing the information requested in this RFI. Specification sheets and product information may also be provided in addition to the whitepaper. Responses to this RFI must be unclassified. Responses should be submitted no later than 1700 hours Eastern on 27 Feb 2009.

<DESC>The US Geological Survey intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Shawnee County, 200 SE 7th St., Topeka, Kansas for digital orthoimagery over the Topeka Urban Area and surrounding Shawnee, Jefferson, and Douglas Counties or approximately 1,588 square miles. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) FAR Subpart 13.  The proposed action is for products for which the Government believes that there is only one responsible source and no other vendor will satisfy the agency's requirement. 
In addition, Shawnee, Jefferson and Douglas Counties will utilize the imagery in all matters related to county business, such as planning, emergency management, engineering, storm water management, utilities, etc.  The public will benefit from this agreement by having access to a Public Domain version of this imagery, and by the government receiving the original high-resolution imagery as a tool to serve and protect its citizens.
The total coverage for Shawnee County is 556 square miles.  Jefferson County is 557 square miles.  Douglas County is 475 square miles.  USGS has the opportunity to obtain all this digital orthoimagery from Shawnee County at approximately 25% of the cost of the entire project because other agencies and local governments are contributing to this project.
The orthorectified digital imagery requirements include the following:  
Covered Topekan urban areas consist of:  6 inch resolution; natural color; ASPRS Class II Accuracy for 1"=100'; NAD 83 Datum; Kansas State Plane North; GeoTiff file format; FGDC Compliant Metadata.
Firms who feel that they can furnish the required products described above and provide considerable cost sharing are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer.  Those firms believing they can provide similar products must provide supporting evidence that they can furnish the products identified above in sufficient detail to demonstrate the respondent's ability to meet the stated requirements. This notice is not a request for competitive quotes.  The Government will consider all responses received within 10 days of the date of publication of this notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquiries will only be accepted by e-mail at ldhayes@usgs.gov.

<SUBJECT>Joint Programmable Fuze Special Notice
<SOLNBR>F08626-98-C-0006A
<CONTACT>Lisa Younghanse, Contract Specialist, Phone 8508830902, Email lisa.younghanse@eglin.af.mil
<DESC><p>The Air Armament Center, 708th Armament Systems Group, Eglin AFB FL, is seeking to advise potential sources of the Air Forces acquisition strategy for the follow on production of the FMU-152A/B Joint Programmable Fuze (JPF) for three follow-on production lots to begin deliveries in 2012.
<p>The JPF is a multifunction, multi-delay tail fuze system with hardened target capability for use in general purpose and penetrating unitary warheads. The JPF operates with a wide variety of guidance kits, high and low drag fins, and with all configurations of the DSU-33 proximity sensor to provide an airburst capability. When used with the Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM), the JPF operating mode and other settings may be selected in flight from the cockpit through a serial RS-422 interface between the weapon and fuze. The objectives of JPF production lots are to fabricate a high quality JPF that is fully integrated and qualified for employment. The following delivery schedule must be met or exceeded; Contract Award - NLT October 2010, first delivery of fully qualified production units - NLT May 2012. The estimated annual budget of $46.9M in FY11, $45.7M in FY12, $44.4M in FY13 and $40.0M in FY14.</p>
<p>Potential offerors would be required to provide a fully qualified JPF that is compatible with the Mark 80 series (MK-82, MK-83, MK-84) and penetrator warheads (BLU-109, BLU-110, BLU-113, BLU-122). It must also be compatible for use in all JDAM variants, AGM-130, and GBU-10/12/15/16/24/27/28 weapon systems as well as in the basic "dumb" bomb configurations. In addition to weapons compatibility, the JPF must be qualified and certified on the following aircraft: B-1B, B-2A, B-52H, F-15E, F-16C/D, F-22, A-10. The contractor must also have adequate resources to provide engineering and testing support for emerging aircraft integration requirements. The current budget only supports the production of FMU-152A/B JPF systems. As a result, the Government considers system maturity to be the top priority, and therefore, offerors must be prepared to begin full rate production by May 2013. The contractor must also have the capacity to produce at a rate of 1,800 systems per month for the duration. Full qualification and integration testing costs, including a First Article Acceptance Test (FAAT) program, would be the total responsibility of the contractor. The contractor must provide shipping to CONUS locations and also provide adequate production, test, logistics (warranty) support, shipping and containers. The contractor must meet the system specifications for both the FMU-152A/B and FZU-55A/B fuze bomb initiator. The system specifications for each may be obtained by contacting the Contract Specialist, Ms. Lisa Younghanse, at (850) 882-8787 ext. 3100.</p>
<p>This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it is not the Government's intention to pay for information solicited at this time. Direct all questions and routine communications concerning this acquisition to Ms. Lisa Younghanse, (850) 883-0902. An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns from offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or Contracting Officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to appropriate Government personnel. When required, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Matters of a routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman, but rather to the POCs listed below. For any other concerns, interested parties may call the AAC Ombudsman, Colonel Arnold W. Bunch, Jr. at (850) 882-0662.</p>
<p>For further information, contact the Contract Specialist, Mrs. Lisa Younghanse, 679 ARSS, (850) 883-0902. <strong>This special notice is for information and planning purposes only.</strong> It does not constitute an invitation for bid or a request for proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. No costs will be paid for any charges incurred in responding to this special notice. When the Air Force begins the follow-on acquisition, formal market research will be conducted at that time to determine whether competitive sources exist. Anyone interested in receiving a technical data package should submit a request in writing and should be addressed to 679 ARSS, Attn: Mrs. Lisa Younghanse, 110 Wacissa Road, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-6864.</p>

<DESC>The subject contract was awarded on 19 Oct 2004 with a 2 year base period ofperformance for $10,355,722 cost, $793,188 fee and 161,280 hours (Total$11,148,910). The rate or costs committed against that ceiling exceededexpectations and the contract option was awarded on 14 FEB 2006 (8 monthsearly). Early award and extension of the option for $16,499,625 cost,$1,275,086 fee and 241,920 hours (Total $17,724,711) allowed the Government tokeep the original contract end date unchanged. Later when the remainingcontract ceiling was not sufficient to provide services pending a newsolicitation and award of a follow on procurement, a cost increase of$9,144,816 was implemented, service hours were increased by 80,260, and theperiod of performance end date was shortened by 10 months to 18 Dec 2008. Afollow on acquisition plan was completed, an RFP issued, proposals received,evaluations performed, an award was announced, and an award protest wasreceived.
If the ceiling of this contract is not increased and the POP extended, theGovernment will be without essential contractor support to provide services tothe SSC PAC customers. This would result in unacceptable delays to projects,and would be unacceptable to sponsors.

They have extensive knowledge of existing Coast Guard data and various software programs which need to be utilized to implement the SFPP process.  This is an ongoing effort.  Soliciting competitive proposals for this second and final phase would result in duplication of costs from Phase I.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Firm, fixed price offers are requested under Request for Quotations (RFQ) solicitation number L09PS00023.  This document incorporated provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-29, Amendment-1.  The NAICS code is 541690 with a business size standard of $7.0 million.
The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is the lead federal agency for the Single Engine Air Tanker (SEAT) program since 1984. The federal SEAT program was developed to use modern agricultural aircraft to assist in wildland fire suppression. Agricultural aircraft were chosen because of their purpose built design to drop retardants/suppressants from a low level; their maneuverability; the fact that there are multiple make/models that are in current production, and for their robust construction. These single pilot aircraft are used primarily as an Initial Attack resource, which means they are often the first aerial resources dispatched to the fire. SEAT pilots may encounter a wide range of complexities from single aircraft to multiple aircraft in confined airspace under challenging weather and terrain. The aircraft and pilots are provided to the Federal Government under contract with the private sector. In 2002 the program under went a rapid increase from 27 aircraft to 78 aircraft. There are currently 16 companies providing 88 aircraft to the National SEAT Program. The average number of hours flown on federal fire suppression contracts has been around 5,000 hours per fire season. The season normally lasts from May through September in the Western United States.
From 1997 to 2008 Federal SEAT program has flown over 59,282 hours with 12 reportable accidents to include 2 fatalities. The federal SEAT program, based on these numbers, has an accident rate of 20.24 per hundred thousand hours. 
Statement of the ProblemThe federal SEAT program has an unacceptably high incident/accident rate. The predominant contributing factor of these incidents/accidents has been determined to be human factors. The Government is seeking assistance in evaluating the SEAT program from a Human Factors stand point with the goal of clearly identifying both active and latent factors while outlining specific mitigation measures to reduce/eliminate SEAT incidents and accidents.
ScopeThe BLM requires a consulting service knowledgeable in Aviation Human Factors to evaluate the federal SEAT program over the course of the 2009 fire season (March  2, 2009  November 1, 2009). The assessment will cover areas such as Human Factors that are contributed to aviation accidents and incidents. The assessment should include Analysis of active and latent errors, procedural unintentional/intentional non compliance, organizational culture, impact of existing SOPs and policies.

Interviews will need to occur over the course of the 2009 Fire Season as well as the National SEAT Training Course, at the Aerial Fire Fighting Institute in Safford, Arizona March 16  March 23, 2009.
Period of Performance (March 2, 2009  November 1, 2009)The BLM will provide an initial in depth briefing on the Federal SEAT program to include a chronological accident history, resulting accident prevention measures (Safety Management Systems), existing policies and procedures.  BLM will also provide a government liaison to the company to assist in the information gathering process. The contractor shall coordinate the timing of the interviews with SEAT vendors, SEAT contractors and Government Personnel with the goal of becoming knowledgeable of SEAT operations, working environment and internal/external forces that may impact SEAT pilots. The written report shall be delivered no later than November 1, 2009.  Formal presentation of the findings will be required at two venues to be determined.
EvaluationRefer to FAR 52.212-02 below.
DeliverablesThe contractor shall deliver a detailed written evaluation of the existing environment, detailing all findings and including recommendations for mitigation.  Recommendations shall include specific short term and long measures to reduce SEAT incidents/accidents and pilot non compliance.

The National Park Service, Lake Mead National Recreation Area, has identified a need for quarterly sampling of monitoring wells as outlined below.
                                                               STATEMENT OF WORK                                                     SAMPLING OF MONITORING WELLS
                                             LAKE MEAD NATIONAL RECREATION AREA (NRA)

Part I - Purpose
The purpose of this work order is to enable the National Park Service (NPS) to obtain professional/technical services in the form of quarterly sampling of monitoring wells located within Lake Mead NRA developed areas. These services will be accomplished through the NPS's competitive bidding process.  
The work applies to the five (5) existing monitoring wells located downgradient of government owned community wastewater treatment facilities, and shall be based on requirements of the respective area's discharge permit.  All permit requirements for monitoring well sampling are the same for each well.   
Part II - Background
A.  Regulatory Requirements
Lake Mead NRA's wastewater treatment systems serve multiple facilities, including small commercial, governmental, and residential.  The systems to be addressed within this work order are located at Overton Beach, Echo Bay, Callville Bay, Las Vegas Bay and Cottonwood Cove (Clark County), Nevada.  These systems are required to be monitored on a quarterly basis via groundwater monitoring wells, pursuant to permit requirements, to determine influence of the facility on adjacent groundwater.  These sites have no known history of use, storage, or disposal of or contamination by, toxic substances.  Historically, there have been incidences of clandestine or accidental entry of small amounts of fuels or oils into NPS collection systems.
B.  Description of Facilities
All monitoring wells are of standard configuration and construction (2" and 4" diameter schedule 80 PVC, locking cap, christie box), and vary in depth from 65 to 200 feet.  Las Vegas Bay, Overton Beach, and Echo Bay are accessible by 2-wheel drive vehicle.  Callville bay and Cottonwood Cove require 4-wheel drive to reach the site.   
Recent measurements indicate approximate water levels below land surface, as follows:
Echo Bay:			                 	 36.99'	Callville Bay:				                dry (total depth 148')	Las Vegas Bay:				                168.50'Cottonwood Cove:				                158.90'Overton Beach				                dry (total depth 150')
It should be noted that both the Overton Beach and Callville Bay wells are currently dry.  We anticipate this will be the case throughout the period of performance of this contract.  Wells should be checked annually (at time of first quarterly sampling) to confirm static water level is below the bottom of the well, and recorded as such.  Payment will be based on travel time and labor to confirm conditions.  Should the static water level be restored at any time during the contract period, sampling will resume next FY pursuant to the terms of this scope.  Payment for any other unforeseen work will be made by contract amendment in accordance with the changes clause of the FAR.
C.  Samples Required
Required samples include Chloride, Nitrate/Nitrite as N, Total Dissolved Solids, and Total Nitrogen.  Sample bottles and chain of custody forms will be provided by NPS, and may be picked up prior to beginning of sampling each calendar quarter.  
Samples, with completed chain of custody documentation, should be delivered to the NPS Warehouse Utility Systems Branch office not later than mid-morning of scheduled laboratory pick up days.

<p><br />________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p><br />ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:</p>
<p>HEALTH &amp; WELFARE: $3.24 per hour or $129.60 per week or $561.60 per month</p>
<p>VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or<br />successor; 3 weeks after 5 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years. Length of service<br />includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or<br />successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the<br />performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)</p>
<p>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year: New Year's Day, Martin Luther<br />King Jr.'s Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day,<br />Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A<br />contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in<br />accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4.174)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE PARENTHESES AFTER THEM RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS (as<br />numbered):</p>
<p>1) Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does not apply to any<br />employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive, administrative, or<br />professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because most Computer<br />System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate not less than<br />$27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per week) an hour<br />would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.400) wage<br />rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations within those<br />job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not list a wage rate<br />for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey data indicates<br />that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds $27.63 per hour<br />conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For example, if an<br />individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties within the scope<br />of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer occupations for which<br />this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate, then the wage rate for<br />that employee must be conformed in accordance with the conformance procedures<br />described in the conformance note included on this wage determination.</p>
<p>Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer<br />industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer<br />professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees<br />who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<br />(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including<br />consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional<br />specifications;<br />(2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or<br />modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and<br />related to user or system design specifications;<br />(3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer<br />programs related to machine operating systems; or<br />(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<br />requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).</p>
<p>2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY &amp; SUNDAY PAY: If you<br />work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential<br />and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.<br />If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<br />regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday<br />premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime<br />(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered<br />overtime work).</p>
<p><br />HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees<br />employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or<br />in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This<br />includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive<br />ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder<br />and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or<br />explosives. Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance<br />operations on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All<br />operations involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.</p>
<p>A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br />represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to<br />ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials<br />which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the<br />employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the<br />like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.<br />All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and<br />incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials<br />are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for<br />ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.</p>
<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<br />local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<br />employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<br />determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<br />following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<br />cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<br />the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<br />this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<br />agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<br />affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<br />and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in<br />those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"<br />materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<br />not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<br />laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<br />of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<br />there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,<br />unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A<br />links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at<br />http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web<br />site at http://wdol.gov/.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form<br />1444 (SF 1444)}</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<br />not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<br />be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such<br />conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the<br />fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by<br />the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)<br />of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall<br />be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}<br />When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444<br />should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be<br />conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation) and computes a proposed rate).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<br />proposed classification title), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<br />proposed classification), job description), and rationale for proposed wage<br />rate), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<br />authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<br />representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the<br />contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<br />performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<br />of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage<br />and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,<br />for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<br />the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.</p>
<p>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<br />that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the<br />wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<br />determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<br />Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<br />classifications listed in the wage determination.</p>

<DESC><p>The purpose of this modification is to: (1) Incorporate additional information for an expanded focus area for FY09.
<p>Under Specific Focus Areas for FY 2009, add the following paragraphs:</p>
<p>Secure cross domain data discovery, access and retrieval: Develop accreditable approaches, mechanisms, and implementations to improve and enable an enterprise-capable secure cross domain information discovery and retrieval capability. This capability should support the discovery, access and consumption of both data and services across security boundaries of multiple types, such as (but not limited to) classification, releasability, organizational and so forth. Information discovery and retrieval involves the search of data resources, to include across security boundaries, and the delivery of that information to the authorized requestor(s) regardless of their location. This effort is intended to support Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) where services publish and find registered enterprise services that can be used for consumption or retrieval.</p>
<p>White papers for this topic will be due by: 20 February 2009. Awards will not exceed 12 months with dollar amounts ranging from $500,000 - $1,000,000.<br /><br />All other information remains the same.</p>

<p>The Acquisition and Contracting Division (AFCEE/AC), Brooks City-Base Texas, in support of the Air Force Center for Engineering and the Environment (AFCEE) is conducting an acquisition for the Environmental, Construction and Operations &amp; Services 2009 (ECOS09) program.

ECOS09 is 100% small business set-aside.</p>
<p>Requirements under this contract will primarily support environmental restoration/remediation and operations/services efforts; but requirements may also include traditional minor construction, demolition, and repair.

Requirements shall be carried out as specified under TOs at locations worldwide, with emphasis on the Continental United States (CONUS).

The Government reserves the right to make fewer, more or no contracts based on the quality and quantity of the proposals. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 562910 (500 employees or less). This size standard applies for establishment of eligibility as a small business.</p>
<p>Excess bonding capacity is $2.5M. Contract Fair Opportunity Selection and Ordering Procedure clauses will be used to compete task orders against the successful offerors. Terms of contract(s) include a five year ordering period plus two additional years for performance.</p>
<p>The Government anticipates releasing the RFP on or about 14 November 2008. The RFP will be issued via FedBizOpps and posted on the AFCEE ECOS09 website, located at https://www.afceeprivweb.brooks.af.mil/pkv/ecos09/default.asp.

<DESC><p>The 6th Contracting Squadron will be soliciting a 100% small business set-aside, competitive Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) to provide indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity and design-build construction efforts to support the 6th CES mission at MacDill AFB and Avon Park, Florida. This acquisition will encompass requirements that have, in the past, been acquired utilizing the Base Engineering Support contractor. Individual task order work will consist of multiple disciplines in general construction categories and execute a broad range of maintenance, repair, minor and/or new construction. Task order limits will be $2,000 to $5,000,000. The contractor shall provide all material, equipment, labor and general conditions to accomplish design, maintenance, repair, and minor construction projects in an expeditious manner. The maximum program value (combined value of all task orders from all awarded contracts) is not to exceed $150M over a five-year period. Each contract awarded will contain a basic 12-month period and four 12-month option periods.<br /><br />Work to be performed under the MACC will be within the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes as follows: Sector 23 Construction, Subsection 236 Construction of Buildings size standard $31M and Subsection 237 Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction, size standard $31M. The work may include facility upgrades, utility work, airfield pavement, roads, roofs and other assorted repair and maintenance projects. The construction work includes tasks in various trades such as carpentry, asbestos abatement and removal, demolition, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, concrete masonry, welding, painting, roofing and paving. Locations of work will be at MacDill AFB, and Avon Park Range, FL. Offers are solicited only from business concerns who are current in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR), and North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 236220 must specifically be included in the Offerors approved business plan.
<p>A Request for Proposal (RFP) is contemplated utilizing best value source selection procedures described in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.3, Air Force Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFFARS) 5315.3, and AFFARS Mandatory Procedures 5315.3, targeted toward competitive offerors with a 45-day response time (offers due 45 days after issuing). In using this approach, the Government seeks to award up to six (6) contracts to small businesses, who give the Air Force the greatest confidence that they can meet our requirements for up to 100% design and construction expertise on infrastructure renovation, repair, new construction, roads, and/or airfield work. The solicitation will include a design/build seed project that will be used to evaluate these capabilities. The seed project is to Repair Hangar 2 Sanitary Sewer System and Bathrooms. The seed project magnitude is between $500,000 to $1,000,000.</p>
<p>The offeror's proposal must convey to the Government that the offeror is capable, possess sufficient technical expertise and experience, possess sufficient resources, and is able to plan, organize, and use those resources in a coordinated and timely fashion such that the technical requirements shall be achieved and costs shall be controlled. MacDill AFB plans to include the following factors and sub-factors: 1) Mission Capability, 2) Proposal risk; 3) Past Performance; and 4) Pricing. Within the Mission Capability Factor the following 4 sub-factors will be used: a) Organizational Structure b) Technical Capability/Execution and Completeness of the Seed Project c) Change and Cost Control Management, and d) Quality Control Procedures. Mission Capability, Proposal Risk, and Past Performance Factors are considered equal in importance. The sub-factors within Mission Capability are also considered equal in importance. Combined, all three factors are significantly more important than cost or price. Cost/Price, however, will contribute substantially to the selection decision and will be assessed for reasonableness.</p>
<p>Up to six (6) highest rated offerors from the source selection will receive basic contract award. The highest rated offeror will be awarded the seed project.<br />All future task orders will be competed among all the contract awardees. All contractors receiving award will receive a not-to-exceed $2,000 task order for the MACC Orientation Seminar to satisfy the contract minimum requirement.</p>
<p>The solicitation will be available in electronic format only. The RFP will be posted on the website at http://www.fbo.gov/ on or about 9&nbsp;Mar 2009 and close on or about 45 calendar days thereafter. No hard copies will be provided. It is the contractor's responsibility to check the website for any and all amendments to this solicitation. Prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before award of a government contract; failure to register in the CCR database may cause your firm to be ineligible for award.</p>

<DESC>Modification to add description as follows:
L09PS00056, GOOD QUALITY HAY FOR THE FEEDING OF WILD HORSES AT THE ELM CREEK, NEBRASKA HOLDING FACILITY, FOR A 12-MONTH PERIOD, WITH TWO 12-MONTH OPTIONS.  Solicitation number L09PS00056 applies and will be issued on or about February 2, 2009 as a Request for Proposals (RFP) for the following requirement:  The Bureau of Land Management's Elm Creek, NE Holding Facility has a requirement for good quality hay to be delivered on a monthly basis from July 1, 2009 to June 30, 2010, with an option for 2 more 12-month periods. The Elm Creek Wild Horse and Burro Facility is located at 5050 100th Road, Elm Creek, Nebraska.  Offerors shall provide a firm fixed monthly unit price for the base year, option year 1 and option year 2. BACKGROUND - This contract is intended to procure quality hay products for the feeding of wild horses and burros at the National Wild Horse and Burro Center at Elm Creek in Elm Creek, NE.  The National Wild Horse and Burro program is an integral part of the management of federal lands in the western United States. Every year wild horses that are determined to be excess on the public lands are removed and placed in the Adopt-A-Horse program. This program places wild horses and burros into private homes around the country.  The Wild Horse and Burro Center at Elm Creek (EC) is charged with taking care of these animals on their journey to private adopted homes. A good feeding program is an integral part to the care the animals receive while on the facility. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS - The purchase of good quality alfalfa hay helps ensure the good care of wild horses on the facility. The contract will ensure the procurement of good quality hay for the feeding of 400-500 wild horses and burros per day throughout the year. This will require the delivery of hay to feed up to 6.5 tons of hay per day or 195 tons per month (which includes an estimated 700 small square bales, per month) throughout the year.  The Hay Contractor shall coordinate all deliveries with the Bureau of Land Managements (BLM) Contracting Officers Representative (COR), and the EC Feeding contractor. The Hay Contractor will unload all the small square bales into the BLM hay shed and the EC Feeding Contractor will unload the loads of round bales with the feeding contractors provided on-site tractor. This is why the hay contractor must coordinate round bale load deliveries with the COR and EC Feeding Contractor. SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS - The primary, large volume feeding of alfalfa hay is through the use of large round bales. This will be the largest amount of hay needed to be supplied by the hay contractor. EC also feeds animals in the smaller load pens and sick pens using small square bales. It is estimated that BLM will need approximately 700 small square bales on a monthly basis. However, this quantity may vary from month to month depending on the number of animals being maintained in sick pens and the number of animals being unloaded at the facility. Large Alfalfa Round-Bale Requirements: Protein level 16% or higher; Relative Feed Value 125 or higher; Weed level less than 5%; Grass level less than 5%; Moisture content of less than 18%; Hay test available upon request within 10 days of delivery; Weigh ticket for each load to verify weight delivered. Small Alfalfa Square Bale Requirements: Protein level 16% or higher; Relative Feed Value 125 or higher; Weed level less than 5%; Grass level less than 5%; Moisture content of less than 18%; A bale should weigh between 65 pounds and 85 pounds; Hay test available upon request within 10 days of delivery; Weigh ticket for each load to verify weight delivered; Delivered/unloaded as directed by the COR. All hay delivered will be free of dust, mold and heating.  All deliveries will be inspected by the on-site COR/PI, and will be subject to their approval and acceptance, or rejection in the event of shipment of non-compliant hay before unloading. Deliveries will be during normal business hours, Monday-Friday 8 a.m-4 p.m., and coordinated with the COR and EC Feeding contractor. Weekend deliveries will only be allowed after approval by the COR and coordinated with the EC Feeding Contractor. Weigh tickets will be provided to the COR when the loads are delivered to the EC facility. The estimated yearly amount of hay to be fed on the facility will be approximately 2,400 tons in a 12 month period. Approximate delivery schedule for the hay will be once a month but could be more frequent if the quantity of hay being consumed is greater or the numbers of animals being housed increases. Hay deliveries will be required in a timely manner and not drawn out except for extenuating circumstances which will require the prior approval by the on-site COR. Deliveries will need to be approximately on average 30 tons per day or within 5-7 working days. Approximately 700 small square bales will be required per month and can be stored in the shed provided by the BLM on-site. The remainder of the hay to be shipped and unloaded shall be the large round bales, as described above. Special circumstances - Inclement weather in Nebraska is a common occurrence. It is the goal of the EC facility to maintain from month to month a backup supply of large round bales of hay to allow for periods of weather in the form of snow or muddy conditions which may conflict with a Hay Contractor's ability to get hay out of a field for delivery to the EC facility. It is the goal of the EC facility to have 30-50 large round bales on-site at all times to maintain a 3-5 day feeding supply on-hand in cases of severe snow or mud conditions which would impact a contractors ability to retrieve hay from a field to deliver to the EC facility. Thus, it is anticipated that deliveries should begin as the supply of hay on the EC facility is at or about 30-50 large round bales. This will insure the facility has a backup supply of hay at all times in the case of delivery problems such as snow and mud conditions or any other unforeseen conflicts occur. This is not a complete list of the specifications and should be used only as a basis to decide whether or not to review the solicitation. Proposals are due March 2, 2009 by 2:00 PM Mountain Time. Send proposals by U.S. Mail to: Department of the Interior; BLM, BC-663; Attention: Steve Santoro; BLDG 50, DFC, PO Box 25047; Denver, CO  80225-0047.

In addition, the software must include a seamless proprietary transition of data from data collection to analysis and interpretation and the capability of opening Applied Biosystems generated data files (.fsa).  Therefore, the required software must be 100 percent compatible with the existing instrument.  Applied Biosystems is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the GENEMAPPER ID-X V1.1 Software, which is required to satisfy the Governments minimum requirements.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by February 10, 2009, 3:30 p.m. EST.

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Olympus America, Inc., Center Valley, PA, for the purchase of fluorescence components for an existing Olympus Model BX-41 Microscope.

Sole Source determination is based on the following:  The Ceramics Division at NIST currently uses an Olympus BX-41 for Fluorescence Microscopy for their experimental setup.  To expand the capability of NISTs existing Olympus BX-41 Microscope, the Ceramics Division requires fluorescence components.  Olympus components are required in order to maintain consistency and compatibility with the Divisions existing microscope.  The specifications (material of manufacture, magnification and numerical aperture, and the RFA that includes two laser ports) for each of the objectives are critical to NISTs measurements, which will enable NIST to quantify the fluidity of fluorescent labels in lipid bilayers, and to capture fluorescent images from the existing Olympus microscope.  Olympus America, Inc., is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the components that is required to satisfy the Governments minimum requirements.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 333314, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by February 10, 2009, 3:30 p.m. EST.

<DESC>This is a revised sources sought announcement for the previous sources sought announcement number A0900000156, for solicitation number N2000091300.  The announcement has been revised to incorporate stone repair and maintenance.
GENERAL:  The National Park Service, Department of Interior, is conducting a sources sought for the work described below.  This notification is for market research purposes to identify potential contractors who have the skills, experience, and knowledge required to successfully complete this effort and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement will be accomplished.  The amount of interest will determine the possibility of a set-aside or full and open competition.  This is not a request for proposal or invitation for bid.  NPS would like interested parties to submit related project experience and resumes for key individuals to Rebecca Bizier at Rebecca_Bizier@nps.gov, or via fax to 303-987-6646 by close of business Tuesday, February 10, 2009.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION:  Work will include analysis of existing conditions, cleaning of existing historic concrete and stone,  replacement-in-kind of portions of historic concrete and stone including but not limited to pavements, stairs, curbs, walls, cornices, benches, patching/repair of spalls and delaminations at concrete elements with an exposed aggregate finish, replication or repair of concrete/stone piers and decorative elements (urns, balusters, obelisks, fountain elements, water spouts, handrails, coping and other pre-formed objects and decorative elements), creation of molds from extant or portions of extant features, repair of concrete/stone with imbedded elements, and repair of cracks in historic concrete and stone.  This would require replication, creation, and/or analysis of concrete mixes and analysis of stone as required.  Work may be vertical or horizontal surfaces.  Repair of modern concrete/stone that is incidental to the historic concrete/stone is also included.  Relevant NAICS codes are 238110, 238120, 238140, and 238190.
Work will potentially occur throughout the National Capital Region.  The National Capital Region (Maryland, District of Columbia, Virginia, and West Virginia) contains more than 700 individual sites, ranging from community parks that serve as neighborhood gathering places to national monuments that attract visitors from around the world. Serving more than 40 million visitors annually, the parks of the National Capital Region encompass more than 87,000 acres of parkland and open space with thousands of historic structures and archeological sites, hundreds of miles of trails, bike paths, riverfront, scenic parkways, and historic canals. The National Capital Region also offers visitors numerous statues, presidential memorials, historic forts, Civil War battlefields, and the White House. Despite ongoing repair and maintenance these sites continue to have large amounts of deteriorated stone and exposed aggregate retaining walls, paving, and steps remaining and deterioration of walls and paving continues. The National Park Service (NPS) seeks interest from experts in the stone and concrete industry capable of providing expert advice, formula development services, and ongoing repair of the concrete and stone decorative features.  
In some cases formulas for the concrete mixes for repair have been developed, but the Park has varied concrete within and additional mixes and formulas may need to be developed to match the historic concrete in the color, texture, frequency of specific aggregate colors and size of the historic concrete aggregate and matrix, including, when possible, using materials from the original quarries.  There are slight variations in the same mix for the concrete in different locations; therefore, some adjustment must be made to create samples to match specific locations. Work may include submitting alternate design mixtures when characteristics of materials, project conditions, weather, test results or other circumstances warrant adjustments. Work may include replacement of portions of stone/concrete pavements and stairs, patch repair of spalls (missing, damaged or deteriorated locations) and delaminations at stone and concrete elements with an exposed aggregate finish, and replication or repair of concrete/stone piers and decorative elements, providing steel reinforcement where necessary. Concrete spalls are both shallow and deep, deep spalls being those which have exposed rebar within the spalled area and shallow spalls those with no visible reinforcing (prior to cleaning and preparation for repair). Some repairs may require injection grout and/or repair mortar.  Repair of modern stone and concrete that is incidental to the historic concrete is also included.
EXAMPLE OF WORK: Meridian Hill Park is located in Washington, D.C. approximately one and one-half miles north of the White House.  It is one of Washington's most important and historic parks in the tradition of the monumental, federal parks of the Mall. Bounded by 16th Street on the west, Euclid Street on the north, 15th Street on the east and W Street on the south, Meridian Hill Park is located within a diverse and changing neighborhood. Originally envisioned as "a classical villa landscape at the center of a vibrant and interesting residential neighborhood", the park continues to play an important role in the physical as well as social landscape of the neighborhood. Meridian Hill Park was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1994, as "an outstanding accomplishment of early 20th-century Neoclassicist park design in the United States" This significant historic resource was originally created to provide visitors and the citizens of Washington D.C. with a formal garden comparable to the public gardens of Paris, Rome and other foreign capital cities. Among its distinctive architectural features are walks, terraces, pools, fountains, and cascades that were constructed of exposed concrete aggregate, using the pioneering techniques developed by craftsman John Earley
TITLE OF PROJECT:  Repair and Maintenance of Historic Concrete and Stone, National Capital Region Parks, District of Columbia, Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia
TYPE OF PROCUREMENT:  NPS is exploring the possibility of soliciting and awarding a multiple year construction IDIQ contract(s) to satisfy this need and is trying to determine the contractor interest, availability, and expertise in this type of requirement.  
SUBMIT:  Please indicate your company's interest in the project by submitting a Company profile with "resume" of your company's experience specific to Historic Concrete and Stone work.  Include references for related experiences.  Many of the parks are open to the public daily.  The example (Meridian Hill Park) is open to the public daily.  Interested contractors are welcome to visit the sites for closer inspection of the work required.   
Due date to submit interest:  Close of Business Tuesday, February 10, 2009

<DESC>Additional Questions:
Describe the site map generation requirement. Where will the generated  XML site map be used in the context of PTO use case?

Answer: The Web CMS must be capable of generating an XML sitemap according to the following protocol: http://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.php. This document also specifies methods for publishing/posting the site maps for search engines.

The list of meta tags in the centralized source may change over time and must be trigger an update in all pages - What is the centralized source and what is included in all pages?

Answer: The meta tags in each page will be generated from an parameterized include file or module that is centrally managed. The tags on each page would be populated with default data specific to the page that corresponds to appropriate parameters in the central file/module. If an additional meta tag parameter is added to the central file/module that new tag would be rendered on all pages, and populated with the default values indicated by the associated parameter (if any) in the central file/module.

Explain Notify web content owner via email of appropriate records related action Which application is triggering the email and where are the email address being managed ?

Answer: The email would be generated by the Web CMS work flow. The email address of each system user would be part of their profile. LDAP would likely be used for user look-up.

The USPTO has our software.  Does that make any difference?  Are you able to re-deploy that product for this project?

Answer: If the version USPTO purchased is capable of meeting the requirements in the RFI, please indicate that in your response for each requirement in the RFI. In your cost proposal, indicate which items USPTO already owns (obviously, this would decrease the acquisition cost to USPTO). If you would like to prepare/recommend a separate response for a more recent version of the software (if any) that better satisfies the requirements in the RFI, please do so.

<DESC>The Department Of Veterans Affairs, VISN 15 Contracting Office intends to purchase, sole-source, an Impella 2.5 Circulatory Assist Device from Abiomed, Inc.  The salient characteristics for this item are:  Circulatory assist device which is inserted percutaneously through the femoral artery identical to normal cardiac catheterization procedures without the need for surgical assistance.  Systems which require the additional use of the femoral vein to complete the circuit of blood flow are not acceptable, as they also require the use of much larger catheters, leading to more bleeding complications.  The system shall provide active unloading of the left ventricle by pumping blood directly from the left ventricle to the ascending aorta.  This allows the left ventricle to pump less blood to the body, thus allowing it to work less.  The system shall not require arterial (transeptal) puncture to place any catheters into the left side of the heart, which will allow for a less complicated procedure.  The system shall use a micro-pump whichis placed into the aorta by means of a catheter, and shall not require the use of an externally placed pump. FDA device approval is required. This purchase is for the St. Louis VA Medical Center.  Abiomed, Inc is the sole manufacturer of this product.  Any contractor who wishes to offer their product in response to this sole-source announcement must submit their technical data to support their claim no later than February 9, 2009.  A fax or e-mail response will be accepted. Fax number is 913-758-6495. The Contracting Office address is: VA Heartland Network 15, Network Business Office, Contracting Section (10N15-90), 4101 S. 4th Street Trafficway, Leavenworth, KS. 66048-5055.
