<CONTACT>Victoria Price, Purchasing Agent, Phone 706-546-2119, Fax 706-546-2157, Email victoria.price@ga.usda.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) has a requirement for manual soil map compilation for 8 counties in Georgia.  Each survey is a single county survey.

BACKGROUND:  The original soil survey maps for these soil survey areas are photo mosaics developed from 1958 aerial photography and may differ by more than forty years from the digital orthophotography used to produce the film orthophotobase.  Due to the mosaic nature of the imagery on the original soil maps, manual redrafting of these maps is required.  The original soil maps are in sheets designed to fit and match each other so, when joined, they will cover an entire county or soil survey area.  Therefore, precision matching between sheets is important.

STATEMENT OF WORK:  The Contractor shall redraft all soil boundary line work, labeling (map unit symbols), and special features for high quality scanning.  To accomplish this, the Contractor shall manually compile soil maps by transferring lines from the original map sheet onto a blank Government furnished Mylar sheet punch registered to the film orthophotobase.  The position of the map sheets must be continually adjusted to match the film orthophotobase to compensate for relief displacement and for changes in position due to the mosaic nature of the background imagery used to produce the original map sheet.  The film orthophotobase has been marked with a red line denoting desired county line.  Any soil lines that overlap this line should be truncated to the red line.  Any areas that fall short of the boundary represented by the red line are to be left blank.  Soil lines, soil symbol layer, and special features are to be drawn and/or labeled in ink.  As a reference, a document entitled “Georgia Compilation Procedure for Soil Survey Digitizing” will be issued with the Request for Quotation (RFQ) and describes procedures NRCS has used in the past.   Electronic samples of the map sheets for each county will also be available.

The anticipated period of performance for site evaluation study contracts is 90 calendar days. The GNEP Technology Demonstration Program would demonstrate certain technologies that could change the way spent nuclear fuel from commercial light-water nuclear power reactors is managed.  DOE intends to demonstrate three key elements that would comprise a proliferation-resistant closed fuel cycle.  These key elements are: (1) a proliferation-resistant process to separate usable elements in commercial spent nuclear fuel from its waste elements; (2) the conversion of transuranics; and (3) an advanced fuel cycle facility.  The DOE GNEP web home page contains further information about the GNEP program.  The home page web link is http://www.gnep.energy.gov/. The anticipated deliverable under each site evaluation study contract is a site evaluation study report containing detailed information about:  the proposed site location (to be chosen by the entity submitting a contract offer and to which the offeror has a legally enforceable commitment to perform the project from the site that will be evaluated in the siting study); facilities (existing or new) that will be used in the demonstration project; federal, state and local regulatory and permitting requirements; project milestones; estimated project costs, including fees associated with meeting regulatory requirements; and other factors that may affect project success, including legislative or regulatory requirements and public perception issues.  The site evaluation study will be used to provide information to support the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) that DOE is initiating to evaluate the potential environmental impacts associated with the GNEP Technology Demonstration Program.  Given the importance of these studies in supporting preparation of the EIS, the technical, regulatory and public outreach expertise of site evaluation study contractors will be of paramount importance. In addition to siting studies, successful offerors may also be tasked to provide technical evaluation and reporting services to the EIS contractor during EIS preparation, public meetings, and the preparation of responses to comments. Collaborative arrangements for submitting site evaluation study contract proposals are encouraged.  These arrangements may include, to the extent permitted by law, domestic private companies, not for profit institutions, state or local governments and agencies, academic institutions, non-government organizations, trade associations, etc.  The location of demonstration project facilities is not limited to DOE sites, but may include other federal and non-federal sites on a strictly voluntary basis. This EOI is intended to encourage an open exchange of ideas regarding the solicitation, award, and administration of site evaluation study contracts. Entities interested in submitting a proposal for a site evaluation study contract are requested to submit a response to this EOI that identifies the entity [organization name, type of organization (private company, not for profit institution, government contractor, etc)] and a point of contact (including an e-mail address and telephone number). Entities submitting a response to this EOI are also encouraged to provide their thoughts and suggestions through the comment form on how DOE should conduct the acquisition and award and administer the site evaluation study contracts. In particular, DOE is seeking input on: ·  Contract type, content of the statement of work, and specific contract terms or conditions ·  Evaluation criteria and selection considerations, including any qualification criteria ·  Other considerations DOE should address during the acquisition (e.g., organizational conflict of interest issues associated with an entity supporting the DOE EIS and working on a site study contract) or after contract award The comment submittal form is available on the GNEP Technology Demonstration Program solicitation website located at www.id.doe.gov. Written responses to this EOI must not exceed four pages and must be received by not later than 4:00 PM, Mountain Time, on March 31, 2006.  Send responses by email to Ms. Janet Surrusco, Contract Specialist, United States Department of Energy, Idaho Operations Office, at surrusjk@id.doe.gov Confidential or business sensitive information contained in the submission must be identified and marked accordingly.  DOE will protect this information from public disclosure to the extent permitted by law. This EOI is not a formal solicitation requesting proposals and does not represent a commitment by the Government to award a contract.  The Government does not intend to formally respond to information submitted in response to this EOI.  The Government is not responsible for costs incurred to submit a response to this EOI, conducting other activities associated with pre-solicitation planning, or submitting a proposal in response to a solicitation if issued.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission architects and engineers to maintain and modernize our legacy federal buildings for the next 50 – 100 years of service. These projects are to demonstrate the value of integrated design that balances historic significance with current needs; balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; and creates environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees. 

In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements. As required by law, all facilities will meet Federal energy targets and security requirements. 


PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The Denver Federal Center (DFC)is a federal campus located in Lakewood, Colorado on 670 acres of land.  Originally, the site was developed for a small arms ammunition plant that was built in 1941 to support the World War II effort.  After the war, the site was adapted as a Federal complex for office, lab and warehouse use.  Currently, there is approximately 3.9 million RSF, 7,000 parking spaces and 90 buildings which houses approximately 30 agencies and bureaus.  The DFC is surrounded by 4 major thoroughfares providing easy and direct access from downtown Denver, Metro Denver, Colorado Springs and Golden for tenant agencies, customers and associates.  

The project involves the complete replacement of domestic and fire water lines, complete replacement of sanitary sewer, partial replacement of storm water lines, electrical, and telecommunications lines and will provide a reliable utility infrastructure that will allow GSA to continue providing service to tenant agencies for the next 50 years. 

SCOPE OF WORK
The scope of professional services will require at a minimum: Professional Architecture and Engineering Services. The scope of work will require at a minimum: construction drawings, specifications, cost estimates, value engineering services, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD) and post construction contract services (PCCS) for a federal campus that includes the decommissioning of an existing pump station and wet wall and the construction of a new pump station, wet well, and associated water system components, site development, client program requirements, and sustainable features. The facility will be designed in English units. NEW WORK IS REQUIRED BY LAW TO BE DONE IN METRIC UNLESS THERE IS A CLEAR RATIONALE FOR ENGLISH UNITS.   THE RATIONALE FOR ENGLISH UNITS IS THAT THE NEW SYSTEMS ARE CONNECTING OR BEING INTEGRATED WITH EXISTING ENGLISH UNIT INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH IS 50 TO 60 YEARS OLD.

The proposed project includes:
•	Updating the sanitary sewer master plan excluding the redevelopment area.
•	Developing a water system master plan excluding the redevelopment area.
•	Replace existing pump station and wet well.
•	Installing two new alternate water supply connections and installing additional piping loop connections and isolation valves.
•	Combine fire protection water system supply piping with the domestic water piping to have a single supply system, per Denver Water’s design and construction requirements.  This also includes the installation of new hydrant assemblies.
•	Partial Replacement of sanitary sewer system collection lines and manhole rehabilitation.
•	Replace a portion of existing overhead communication lines with new underground lines.
•	Install approximately one mile of duct bank to replace overhead wire systems and connect dead-end electrical loops.
•	Replace electrical distribution switchgear components.
•	Experience working within contaminated environmental areas is required.

The project is also to include GSA design standards for secure facilities; conformance to the P-100 (Facility Standards for Public Buildings), sustainability goals, and customer agency requirements.  In addition, because this work is on a secured federal campus, security clearances are required prior to working on the site.

SELECTION PROCESS

The initial award will be for Phase I, CEDS preliminary design.  A competitive solicitation for a firm fixed price contract, not to exceed a government specified maximum price, is expected to be issued within the next 30 days.  Offerors may submit proposals to conduct the preliminary design for one or both display categories.  Since the Phase II development and qualification, production and program support CLINS are unpriced options at Phase I contract award, proposals must address the Offerors’ capability to support all requirements of the Statement of Work, including qualification, production and logistics support of designed systems.  Multiple Phase I contracts will be awarded.  Contracts for the preliminary design of display consoles and remote displays will each be awarded to two contractors (more than two awards may be made based on funding availability).  Additionally, if two or more qualified, responsive and reasonable pr!  oposals are received from small business, at least one Phase I contrac t will be awarded to a small business for the Preliminary Design of Display Consoles or Remote Displays.  The source selection will be based on a best value determination. Response to Industry questions and comments to the draft RFP that was issued in September 2005 will be posted within approximately the next 15 days.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division, intends to issue a solicitation for a Blackwater  and Graywater Treatment System for a United States Coast Guard Cutter. This is a fully automated, self-contained treatment system that provides treatment of blackwater and graywater found on the ship which is equipped with blackwater vacuum collection and graywater gravity collection systems.  Treatment systems must provide the entire process required to treat incoming wastewater mixture in accordance with this specification. Offerors will be required to submit technical and cost proposals.

On Tuesday, 04 April 2006 a pre-solicitation site visit will be conducted on board the USCG BLUEBELL located in Portland, Oregon.  Since the Coast Guard Cutter is an older ship, complete and accurate configuration drawings showing service interfaces such as electrical, sea water, drains, ship service air, etc. as well as potential integration interferences are not available.  The specification has maximum dimensions identified but contractors are invited to propose ways to optimize the space available on the ship based on the type of Marine Sanitation Device the offeror is considering proposing.   Offerors are urged and expected to inspect the site and to satisfy themselves regarding all general and local conditions that may affect the cost of contract performance, to the extent that the information is reasonably obtainable. In no event shall failure to inspect the site constitute grounds for a claim after contract award.  Offers must contact the contract specialist, Camille Mesquita at camille.mesquita.navy.mil by 24 March 2006 order to register for the site visit and obtain details. The solicitation is expected to be released on or about 10 April 2006. Solicitation packages will only be available electronically and no hard copies will be sent. All interested parties may download the solicitation and any amendments at http://www.neco.navy.mil or http://www.fedbizopps.gov after the release date of the solicitation.

Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command.  NUWCDIV Newport has been tasked to assist in the procurement of an advanced communications system for navy units including submarines.  The communications system, the Navy Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) Multiband Terminal (NMT) is currently in the downselect phase of the program.  A technical evaluation of the proposals submitted concerning the design, fabrication, assembly, integration, documentation, testing and delivery will be conducted.  An unusually large team is required due to the complexity of the procurement and the time required to complete the evaluation in order to meet program schedule and there are no Government personnel with the requisite expertise.  NUWC intends to award a sole source, fixed price contact using SAP procedures to Telecommunications Systems, Annapolis, MD for technical support of 252 manhours to assist in the downselect process.  The contractor support personnel will be used as non-voting members.  The basis for the sole source is that TS has subject matter experts in EHF terminal software design and personnel with unique knowledge of the AEHF and NMT program and the prime contactor’s system design.

<DESC>The NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) has a requirement to continue specialized scientific and technical Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) support to the NASA Solid Earth and Interior focus area in the Space Geodesy Laboratory. This support includes, but is not limited to, the following:  1) observation coordination, 2) data acquisition, 3) station support, 4) correlation, data processing and analysis, 5) data distribution and archiving, 6) technique improvement and research, 7) IVS activities, 8) computer support, and 9) combination of Space Geodetic data.   NASA GSFC intends to increase the maximum ordering value by $500,000 under Contract NAS5-01127 to allow for the extension of task order requirements for up to 2 ½ additional months beginning July 12, 2006. At this time, it is anticipated that VLBI task order requirements will only be extended through September 30, 2006.	The maximum ordering value increase and task order extension are required to ensure uninterrupted support and to meet critical requirements until the follow-on competitive contract is awarded. While the competitive follow-on procurement is being conducted, NVI, Inc. must continue supporting the following critical requirements: coordination of VLBI experiments including requesting and scheduling of observing and correlating resources, generation and distribution of observing schedules and procedures and retrieval of observing logs; developing, implementing, documenting, and maintaining Field System software and procedures associated with Mark III, Mark IV, VLBA, Mark 5, S2 and various K4/K5 data acquisition operations at field stations; implementation and maintenance of VLBI stations including logistical support, preparation of standard and custom software, travel, verification of readiness, training, trouble-shooting, and assistance in data acquisition; preparation of experiments for correlation and processing of correlator output into data bases suitable for geodetic/astrometric analysis; and analysis and monitoring of station, correlator, and source performance.  This procurement action is being conducted in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) Only One Responsible Source. NVI, Inc. possesses the unique and specialized experience necessary to support the critical requirements until the follow-on contract is awarded. NVI, Inc. is the only company with the capability to provide the technical support without a reduction in service. In addition, specific areas wherein NVI, Inc. possesses unique knowledge not possessed by other vendors include:  evaluation of VLBI system performance and knowledge of the Mark IV Field system.	It would not be possible to duplicate or replace NVI’s expertise in the timeframe necessary to meet requirements.  The Mark IV Field System, which operates the VLBI data acquisition terminal and provides the interface to the station and the correlator, has been developed at Goddard by the incumbent contractor and requires detailed knowledge of the software functions, VLBI hardware, VLBI data acquisition and correlation procedures, and stations interfaces. In addition, it is not practical or cost effective to conduct a full and open competition for 2 ½ months of support as a precursor to the award of a follow-on contract. Competing a contract for only 2 1/2 months introduces risks to the completion of critical requirements to support the Space Geodesy Laboratory. The phase-in time and lead-time for new contractor personnel to become minimally experienced and functional to meet the government requirements will result in unacceptable delays.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. See Note 26.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on March 31, 2006. Interested organizations must provide documentation which establishes its capability in the required areas including documentation of past relevant experience. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  An Ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>The National Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the Analytical Chemistry Division, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 13.106(b)(1), with Savillex Corporation of Minnetonka, MN for PFA Teflon Jars with Recessed Lids.  

Sole source determination is based on the following:  The PFA Teflon Jars with recessed Lids are used in continuing research projects that began in 1987.  These jars are used to store tissues collected in the field for long term archival and for contaminants analysis.  The jars must be identical, as there are 2 facilities that utilize the jars for analyzing and results.  Data compatibility would be compromised if other jars were used.  The racking systems (boxes and tubes) have been specially created for the dimensions of the jars to fit inside each rack type.  Savillex Corporation is the sole manufacturer and sole distributor of the PFA Teflon Jars. 

No solicitation package will be issued.  

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, responses received by March 27, 2006, will be considered by the Government.

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This is UNRESTRICTED announcement, open to both large and small businesses.  Architect-Engineer services are required for an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract.  The technical areas in which services shall be provided will includ e but not be limited to the prediction of loads and the design/analysis of infrastructures/facilities that resist the effects of military weapons (nuclear and conventional), improvised terrorist weapons and explosive devices, accidental explosions, impact loads, forced entry tools, and surveillance and eavesdropping tools.  However, technical areas shall also include more general problems that involve the application of engineering principles, including security engineering and vulnerability surveys for ant iterrorism/force protection.  The services provided in these technical areas shall include studies and investigations that support design projects and the evaluation or modification of existing facilities, analysis of structural and mechanical systems usin g computer methodologies, development of design criteria and design methodologies, and development of computer automated tools that support activities performed by others.  Some of the work to be completed under this contract may support construction proje cts; other work may include providing engineering analyses/drawings/specifications/guidance or teaching classes to support the Protective Design Center.  Final AE selection and award of the contract is anticipated in either May or June 2006.  If a large bu siness is selected, a Small Business Subcontracting Plan consistent with Section 806 (b) of PL 100-180, 95-907, and 99-661, will be required as a part of the negotiations of contractual rates.  The subcontracting plan is not required as part of this submit tal.  Suggested goals for Small Business Community participation are a minimum of 51.2% of any subcontracting dollars shall be placed with small business (SB) concerns.  Of those small business subcontracted dollars, 8.8% of total planned subcontracting do llars shall be placed with Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDB), including Historically Black College and University or Minority Institutions, (HBCU/MI), 7.3% of the planned subcontracted small business dollars with Women-Owned Small Businesses (WOSB), 3.1 % of the planned subcontracted small business dollars with HUB Zone small business firms (HubZone), and 1.5% of the planned subcontracted small business dollars with Small Disadvantaged Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB).  Omaha District encourages smal l businesses to participate as primes, team members with large businesses or enter into teaming arrangements with other small businesses.  Any teaming arrangement entered into needs to be supported by detailed documentation of the agreement, such as a Join t Venture Agreement, Mentor  Protégé agreements  or other teaming arrangement.  It is imperative that all small disadvantaged businesses contact their Small Business Administration Office to obtain Small Disadvantaged Business Certification.  Without SBA SDB certification, neither a prime contractor nor a federal agency can receive credit for utilizing SDB contractors/subcontractors.  The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) applied to this action is 541330, having a size standard of $4,500, 000 of average annual receipts over the past 3 fiscal years. 2.

The application of a scale of words, or colors, used in conjunction with narrative, to denote the degree to which  the proposal has met the standard for a non-cost factor.  For purposes of this solicitation, ratings will consist of words (adjectival method) used in conjunction with narratives.  Ratings will be applied at the criterian and sub-criterian level.  If at a ny level of indentation an Offerors proposal is evaluated as not meeting a minimum requirement (that is, below the level of Satisfactory), this fact may be included in the rating and narrative assessment at that level and each higher level of indentation.   Therefore, a Marginal or Unacceptable rating at any level may be carried to the criterian level.  The following ratings will be used to evaluate the submitted information. (i)	Outstanding  - Information submitted demonstrates offerors potential to significantly exceed performance or capability standards.  The offeror has clearly demonstrated an understanding of all aspects of the requirements to the extent that timely and h ighest quality performance are anticipated.  Have exceptional strengths that will significantly benefit the Government.  The offerors qualifications exceed the fullest expectations of the Government.  The offeror has convincingly demonstrated that the RFP  requirements have been analyzed, evaluated, and synthesized into approaches, plans, and techniques that, when implemented, should result in outstanding, effective, efficient, and economical performance under the contract.  Significantly exceeds most or al l solicitation requirements.  Very high probability of success. (ii)	Above Average  - Information submitted demonstrates offerors potential to exceed performance or capability standards.  Have one or more strengths that will benefit the Government.  The areas in which the offeror exceeds the requirements are anticipat ed to result in a high level of efficiency or productivity or quality.  The offerors qualifications meet and slightly exceed requirements.  The submittal contains excellent features that will likely produce results very beneficial to the Government.  Full y meets all RFP requirements and significantly exceeds many of the RFP requirements.  Disadvantages are minimal.  High probability of success. (iii)	Satisfactory (Neutral) - Information submitted demonstrates offerors potential to meet performance or capability standards.  Acceptable solution.  Either meets all RFP requirements for the criterion (or sub-criterion) or contains weaknesses in some areas that are offset by strengths in other areas.  A rating of Satisfactory indicates that, in terms of the specific criterion (or sub-criterion), the offeror has a good probability of success, as there is sufficient confidence that a fully compliant leve l of performance will be achieved.  The proposal demonstrates an adequate understanding of the scope and depth of the RFP requirements.  No significant advantages or disadvantages.  Equates to neutral. Good probability of success. (iv)	Marginal - The submittal is not adequately responsive or does not address the specific criterion (or sub-criterion).  The offerors interpretation of the Governments requirements is so superficial, incomplete, vague, incompatible, incomprehensible, o r incorrect as to be considered deficient.  Proposal does not meet some of the minimum requirements.  The assignment of a rating within the bounds of Marginal indicates that mandatory corrective action would be required to prevent significant deficiencies from affecting the overall project.  The offerors qualifications, plans or approach will likely result in questionable quality of performance, which represents a moderate level of risk to the Government.  Low probability of success although the submittal has a reasonable chance of becoming at least acceptable.  Significant disadvantages. 		      (v)	 Unsatisfactory  - Fails to meet performance or capability standards.  Unacceptable.  Requirements can only be met with major changes to the submittal.  There is no reasonable expectation that acceptable performance would be achieved.  The proposal contains many deficiencies and/or gross omissions; fails to provide a reasonable, logical approach to fulfilling much of the Governments requirements; and/or fails to meet most or all of the minimum requirement s. Very significant disadvantages. 5.

<DESC>This modification is being issued to correct the response date to read 21 March 2006 instead of July 28, 2005 in the Source Sought Notice.



The U.S. Coast Guard is considering whether or not to set aside an acquisition for HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Concerns (SDVOSB), or Small Business concerns only.  The small business size standard is less than 1,000 employees.  The acquisition is for DRYDOCK repairs to 47 Foot “B” Class Motor Lifeboats. These vessels are tentatively geographically restricted to 140 nautical miles from Woods Hole, MA. The requirements period is to run 12 months from date of award. The procurement contains Two (2) 12 month option years to be exercised at the government’s discretion. The scope of the acquisition is for the overhauling, renewing and repairing of various items aboard the 47 Foot “B” Class Motor Lifeboats.

This work will include, but is not limited to:  Welding Repairs; Renew, Inspect, and Reinstall Propeller Shafts; Straighten Shaft; Renew Propulsion Shaft Strut and Stern Tube Bearings; Renew, Inspect, and Reinstall Rub Rail; Remove, Inspect, and Test Upper Buoyancy Chamber; Renew Strut; Remove and Reinstall Main Engine; Remove, Inspect, and Reinstall Propeller; Perform Minor Repair and Reconditioning of Propeller; Install Government-furnished Fathometer Transducer; Test and Renew Valves; Inspect Hydraulic Steering Gear; Inspect Duplex Sea Strainers; Remove, Inspect and Reinstall Rudder Assembly; Renew Rudder Bearings; Preserve Underwater Body; Provide Temporary Logistics; Routine Drydocking; and Clean, Inspect, and Air Test Fuel Tank. 

Trained welders, who have been certified by the applicable regulatory code performance qualification procedures, shall accomplish all welding and brazing.  At the present time, it is expected that the acquisition will be issued as a small business set aside.  However, in accordance with FAR 19.1305 if your firm is HUBZone certified or a Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Business and intends to submit an offer on this acquisition, please respond by e-mail to dawn.j.dabney@uscg.mil or by fax at (757) 628-4676.  Questions may be referred to Dawn J. Dabney at (757) 628-4636.  In your response you must include: (a) a positive statement of your intention to submit a bid for this solicitation as a prime contractor; (b) evidence of experience in work similar in type and scope to include contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts, points of contact and telephone numbers; (c) past performance references with points of contact and telephone numbers; and (d) if your company does not own the drydock, a letter of commitment from the company providing the drydock committing to provide the drydock during the time period of this availability.  At least two references are requested, but more are desirable.  Your response is required by March 21, 2006.  Contractors are reminded that should this acquisition become a HUBZone set aside, FAR 52.219-3, Notice of Total HUBZone Set-aside, will apply, which requires that at least 50 percent of the cost of personnel for contract performance be spent for employees of the concern.   Contractors are also reminded that should this acquisition become a Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Business set aside, FAR 52.219-27, Notice of Total Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Set-Aside, will apply, which requires that at least 50 percent of the cost of personnel for contract performance be spent for employees of the concern.  All of the above must be submitted in sufficient detail for a decision to be made on a HUBZone set-aside or Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business set-aside.  Failure to submit all information requested may result in Small Business set-aside acquisition.  A decision on whether this will be pursued as a HUBZone Small Business set-aside, a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business set-aside or a Small Business set-aside, will be posted in FedBizOpps website at http://www.eps.gov.

<DESC>Subject: Questions related to SOW (Document No. 06-LUHJ-005) 

Clarification and guidance for the purpose of accurately proposing a solution to the AF's requirements are as follows: 
 
Section 2.0 Applicable Documents: reference paragraphs 2.1 and 2.2 (Military Specifications and Standards) of the SOW. What is meant by the term “as guidance only” in this paragraph? This statement is contradicted in Sections 3.2.4(Operating Environment) , 3.2.5 (Maintainability), and 3.2.6 (Electromagnetic Radiation)
RESPONSE #1: The term “as guidance only” will be removed from the paragraph. Note the second sentence in the paragraph clarifies the issue further by granting the contractor latitude in proposing alternative commercial standards, etc. 
Can our team provide the government with a solution that is NOT MIL-STD or MIL-Spec per 2.1 and 2.2 for this procurement. Are the existing commercial standards for the Amptec 630BN acceptable to be proposed in meeting the government’s requirements (as in line 2 of section 2.0). 
RESPONSE #2: This question has already been answered by Response #1. Note that the present AMPTEC 630BN Test Set has been board certified by the US Navy Tomahawk Cruise Missile and Standard Missile Safety Board approved. Modifications to the JSSE shall meet the requirements of paragraphs 2.1 and 2.2.
We would propose a commercially developed tester and if required by the end user and would also provide the “additional” costs of testing the units per the MIL-STD and MIL-Specs identified in sections 2.1. And 2.2 as an added cost to this item. (Optional line pricing for any MIL STD Testing and Certifications).
RESPONSE #3: All test costs for the modified JSSE shall be included in the price of the modified JSSE. 
Section 2.1, MIL-HDBK-5400 states on the front page that “This handbook is for guidance only. Is this document as a requirement? Also, this handbook was written for Airborne Electronic Equipment. We believe it is not applicable for this project.
RESPONSE #4: MIL-HDBK-5400 is a requirement as stated in paragraph 2.1
Section 2.2, MIL-STD-130K called out a date of 10 Oct 03 and IHS only has the date of 15 Jan 00.
RESPONSE #5: The date for MIL-STD-130K will be changed to 15 JAN 00.
Section 3.1.6 Engineering Data: specifies that the contractor will develop the TDP to allow for the ability of another “competent” manufacturer the ability to produce an item from this package. Is a commercial manual acceptable for this requirement? 
RESPONSE #6: Paragraph 3.1.6 refers to a complete TDP, to include drawings and blueprints. A commercial manual by itself will not satisfy this requirement.
Section 3.2.8, the SOW states “The JSE shall be able to operate on battery power or recharge and operate from a 120/220 VAC, 60-50 Hz…….” So the question is does the government need the rechargeable capability in this unit? If so then we are OK with that requirement. 
RESPONSE #7: The Government desires rechargeable capability for the JSSE, as well as the other characteristics listed in 3.2.8.
Section 3.3 Performance Characteristics has changed once again back to the incorrect specifications that we had addressed in our previous attempt to update the specifications.
Please reference Document 05-LUHJ-004 rev A dated 31 August 2005. (Section 3.3 
Our team provided (and will provide again) what we believe the correct specifications for this instrument for Sections 3.3.1 (Voltage Test), 3.3.2 (Resistance Test), 3.3.3 (Stray Voltage Test) and 3.3.4( Load Test) should be. They are as follows: 
Section 3.3.1 (Voltage Test): Should be changed to read: The JSSE shall measure voltage from 0-200 VDC maximum and the voltage tolerance needs to be changed to ± 0.05 % of range (200V). This calculation works out to 10 counts on a 20K count display.
RESPONSE #8: The government concurs with this clarification and will change the SOW accordingly. 
Section 3.3.2 (Resistance Test): Should be changed to read: The JSSE shall measure the circuit resistance from 0-200 Kilo Ohm with an accuracy of within ± 0.05 % of range (200k ohm). For circuit resistance of 1 Mega Ohm or greater, within ± 0.1 % of range. We propose to supply a meter with a 2.0 Mega Ohm range which would could count up from 0 to 1.9999 Mega Ohms (4.5 digit display).
RESPONSE #9: The government concurs with the clarification as suggested and will change the SOW accordingly. The Government declines comment on, and does not endorse, the contractor’s proposal concerning a meter with a 2.0 mega-ohm range. 
Section 3.3.3 (Stray Voltage Test): For the 50mVDC measurement we propose the meter with a 200mVDC range with an accuracy of ± 0.25 % of range. For the 50mVAC measurement we propose the meter with a 200mVAC range with an accuracy of ± 0.25 % of range. This is for an AC frequency band width from 60hZ to 1khZ. 
RESPONSE #10: The Government does not recognize this as a Contractor proposal. Section 3.3.3 will be changed to reflect appropriate JSSE specifications on this subject.
Section 3.3.4(Load Test): The JSSE shall be capable of inducing a calibrated load sufficient to draw 4 Amperes of current on it’s 20 amp range (up to 19.999 amperes) with an accuracy within ± 0.2 % of range. Current must be measured through each jettison chamber using existing firing conductor and ground. To minimize the possibility of overheating the aircraft circuit, the load shall be applied by user utilizing a momentary switch, spring loaded to the off/unload position. 
RESPONSE #11: The government concurs with this clarification and will change the SOW accordingly. 
Section 3.3.5 requires a “commercially available” battery source with the capabilities of providing power for up to twelve (12) of operation continually. Current commercial grade batteries are operating in the 8-10 hour range without recharging. Any commercial battery that may need 12 hours of continuous operation may not be “cost effective” for this procurement. Is 8-10 hours of operation acceptable to the customer? The system will be able to recharge if needed.
RESPONSE #12: The government concurs with this comment; 8 to 10 hours of operation is acceptable. The SOW will be changed accordingly. 
Section 4.2.5, need this to be revised to reflect MIL-STD-461E. This is the latest mil standard and all of the labs are familiar with this standard. Within this standard, the test methods and test limits are included. If we were to use MIL-STD-461B, the end user will have to supply the test limits to which the unit will be tested. The 461E was written as an improvement over 461B and the test results will be more consistent.
RESPONSE #13: The government concurs with this clarification and will change the SOW accordingly.
Section 4.3 Performance Testing: This section(s) still call out the MIL-STD requirements that are in Section 2.1 and 2.2. Are these requirements for testing the commercial units applicable? 
RESPONSE #14: See Response #s 1 and 2.
**END**

WR-ALC/LUKB has a requirement for the modification of AMPTEC 630BN water-reistant igniter tester failsafe digital ohmmeter to perform in accordance with Statement of Work 06-LUHJ-0005. The modified AMPTEC 630 BN will be referred to as the Jettison System Support Equpment (JSSE).  The JSSE shall be a stand alone unit used to test the MH-53M auxiliary tank jettison system wiring and circuitry prior to installation of the jettison system explosive cartridges.  The JSSE shall be capable of verifying system ability to ignite explosive cartridges. The JSSE shall accurately measure ohms, volts and amperes.  These circuit testing modes will be used to indicate improper aircraft and pylon wiring, presence of circuit corrosion, loose wiring and connectors, high circuit resistance, circuit breakers ability to support an operational load, switch operations, stray voltages, and conditions which could make the system unreliable and unsafe for handling of explosive cartridges.  Requirement will require the testing of a prototype tester before producing an additional 8 testers.

**DSCR intends to add four more additional FSCs to the privatization initiative:  6810-Reagent & Technical Grade Chemicals; 6820 – Dyes; 6840 – Pesticides, Disinfectants, Repellants, Deodants; 6850-Compounded Chemicals.  The list of items are posted on the following website:  http://www.dscr.dla.mil/userweb/faga/index.html, Under “Specialized Support,” Click on “Privatization Efforts.”  Please advise of any changes to your response to the RFI by COB 3/24/06.**

PROGRAM OVERVIEW

Under the Base Realignment and Closure Act of 1990, 10 U.S.C. 2687 note, the BRAC Commission’s recommendation to privatize the supply, storage and distribution for packaged petroleum, lubricants, oils, and compressed gases (Federal Supply Classes 6830 and 9150) became law on November 8, 2005.  Cylinders and valves (FSC 8120) are implicitly included in this initiative, and all ozone depleting substances are excluded.  The Defense Supply Center Richmond (DSCR) will lead the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) in this effort by transforming this portion of chemical supply chain through reductions in chemical use, waste, and lifecycle costs, for all of DLA’s continental U.S. (CONUS) customers and potentially OCONUS (overseas) customers.  Presently, DLA uses a multitude of sources, storage facilities, and delivery methods to satisfy its customers’ hazardous material needs.  DLA’s intention is to leverage the commercial industry and implement regional chemical management services programs across the U.S.  This initiative is designed to assure readiness, safety, and efficiency.  Ultimately, DLA’s goal is to improve lead-times, reduce costs, and increase customer satisfaction while allowing the customers to focus on their core competencies.

Anticipated Scope of Services:

Forecasting collaboration with customers - Accurately predicting future customer requirements/demand patterns.

Procurement/Purchasing - All actions related to acquisition planning, solicitation, evaluation, negotiations, contract award, contract administration, and contract management functions.

Inventory Management/Storage/Warehousing - The direction and control of activities with the purpose of getting the right inventory in the right place at the right time in the right quantity in the right form at the right cost.

Environmental, Safety, and Occupational Health (ESOH) services (to include disposal) – To provide an effective, sound, environmentally safe and occupational health management system.  It is intended to be used in conjunction with other pertinent procedures, regulations, manuals, and guidance documents that support environmentally sound management.

Customer Direct - Ship directly to joint warfighter customers across a broad spectrum of locations both CONUS and potentially OCONUS.  Deliver items using shipping methods defined by terms and conditions of the contract (i.e. required delivery date, packaging requirements, delivery address, special instructions for emergency or other needs).  Track the delivery of items. 

Data Management - to include interoperability with industry and government systems.

PROGRAM OVERVIEW

Under the Base Realignment and Closure Act of 1990, 10 U.S.C. 2687 note, the BRAC Commission’s recommendation to privatize the supply, storage and distribution for packaged petroleum, lubricants, oils, and compressed gases (Federal Supply Classes 6830 and 9150) became law on November 8, 2005.  Cylinders and valves (FSC 8120) are implicitly included in this initiative, and all ozone depleting substances are excluded.  The Defense Supply Center Richmond (DSCR) will lead the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) in this effort by transforming this portion of chemical supply chain through reductions in chemical use, waste, and lifecycle costs, for all of DLA’s continental U.S. (CONUS) customers and potentially OCONUS (overseas) customers.  Presently, DLA uses a multitude of sources, storage facilities, and delivery methods to satisfy its customers’ hazardous material needs.  DLA’s intention is to leverage the commercial industry and implement regional chemical management services programs across the U.S.  This initiative is designed to assure readiness, safety, and efficiency.  Ultimately, DLA’s goal is to improve lead-times, reduce costs, and increase customer satisfaction while allowing the customers to focus on their core competencies.

Anticipated Scope of Services:

Forecasting collaboration with customers - Accurately predicting future customer requirements/demand patterns.

Inventory Management/Storage/Warehousing - The direction and control of activities with the purpose of getting the right inventory in the right place at the right time in the right quantity in the right form at the right cost.

Environmental, Safety, and Occupational Health (ESOH) services (to include disposal) – To provide an effective, sound, environmentally safe and occupational health management system.  It is intended to be used in conjunction with other pertinent procedures, regulations, manuals, and guidance documents that support environmentally sound management.

Customer Direct - Ship directly to joint warfighter customers across a broad spectrum of locations both CONUS and potentially OCONUS.  Deliver items using shipping methods defined by terms and conditions of the contract (i.e. required delivery date, packaging requirements, delivery address, special instructions for emergency or other needs).

<DESC>USPS Materials Production and Distribution (MP&D), Supply Management, provides support to the US Postal Service with regard to the receipt, storage and distribution of (1) repair parts for all automated and mechanized mail processing equipment (2) supplies (forms, tags, handbooks, retail products, etc.), and (3) equipment (lockboxes, mail sorting tables, etc.).

USPS MP&D provides inventory support for new programs with duration of 5 years or less.  New programs requiring warehousing and distribution support are often implemented in an independent and non-integrated fashion, resulting in higher costs to the Postal Service.  Significant cost savings would result if the Postal Service were to partner and implement a standardized approach for the warehousing and distribution of inventory required for these new programs.

The approach being considered by USPS MP&D involves contracting with a 3PL provider for warehousing and distribution support for new short-term Postal Service programs.  This approach would allow the Postal Service to have in place a proven 3PL provider possessing the required system interfaces necessary to interact with postal systems.  This approach would also provide the USPS with access to a preferred logistics company which could provide real-time cost estimates to meet requirements as they arise.  Additionally, it would provide an alternative to supplier-provided distribution, thus reducing the purchasing cycle time for the entire program.

The downstream fish passage measures of the Northwest Power and Conservation Council (NPCC) Fish and Wildlife Program include flow augmentation and voluntary spill to mitigate for the effects of the Federal Columbia River Power System (FCRPS) on anadromous and resident fish. The program also includes monitoring and evaluation to assess the progress in accomplishing the biological objectives of the program at a basin-wide level. A Fish Passage Center (FPC) was included in the mainstem program (NPCC 2003).  The primary purpose of the FPC has been to provide technical assistance and information to Fish and Wildlife Agencies, Tribal Fish and Wildlife Agencies and the general public on matters related to juvenile and adult salmon and steelhead passage through the mainstem hydrosystem. 

Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) was selected by the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) to develop and provide a process for responding to requests for technical analysis. The process will incorporate rigorous peer review to ensure the highest standards of data quality and scientific integrity are met for technical products delivered to regional managers and researchers. The peer-reviewed technical analysis products that result will provide information to fisheries managers on matters related to juvenile and adult salmon and steelhead passage through the mainstem hydrosystem, as well as implications for resident fish.

PNNL is seeking to establish a pool of qualified individuals to serve as Technical Analysts and Technical Reviewers. The following is a brief description of the responsibilities for each category:
Technical Analysts:  Individuals are needed to conduct technical analyses relating to fish passage and the operation of the Federal Columbia River Power System (FCRPS). These requests will involve analyses concerning alternative operational scenarios or other management actions and their influence on the passage or survival of juvenile and adult salmon, steelhead, and resident fish. Analyses will require the integration of passage, survival, operational, and environmental information to analyze, summarize and interpret fish passage data, as well as data available from other sources to address basin-wide as well as project-specific fish passage issues
Technical Reviewers:  Individuals are needed to participate in a peer review panel for the products produced in response to technical analysis requests. The peer reviewers would be expected to respond to a written request for review of a technical analysis product. Those reviewers will prepare a report that describes the nature of their review and their findings and conclusions. That report would critique the product on how well it addresses the objectives of the original request and suggest ways to clarify assumptions, findings, or conclusions. The report would also identify oversights, omissions, and inconsistencies. When needed, the report would include comments and recommendations to the analyst for incorporation prior to final approval by reviewers and release of the product to the requestor and the public.

Interested parties that wish to be considered for both roles should indicate the position they prefer, because an individual will not be allowed to serve in both roles.
To be considered for one of these positions, interested parties should email Julie Hughes at Julie.Hughes@pnl.gov. A formal Request for Qualifications package will be transmitted to all respondents.  Questions regarding this solicitation should be directed to Ms. Hughes at (509) 372-3943.

BACKGROUND The Imperial Sand Dunes Recreation Area is a 40-mile-long dune system, also known as the Algodones Sand Dunes, is one of the largest in the United States.  Formed by windblown beach sands of ancient Lake Cahuilla, some crests reach heights of over 300 feet.  These expansive dune formations offer picturesque scenery, opportunities for solitude, and a chance to view rare plants and animals, and a playground for off-highway vehicles (OHV's).  The sand dunes serve different purposes throughout the calendar year.  South of California State Route 78, the dunes is used as an OHV recreation area.  Two BLM Campgrounds along paved Gecko Road provide hard surface parking, vault toilets, and trash facilities.  Visitor information and emergency medical services are available weekends during the winter season (October - May) at Cahuilla Ranger Station.  Located north of State Highway 78 in the Imperial Sand Dunes, this wilderness is within one of the largest sand belts in North America, extending over 40 miles in length and 3 to 6 miles in width.  The wilderness is divided into two distinct zones with the largest and tallest dunes located on the west side.  The east side contains smaller dunes and numerous washes, which provide forage for visiting black-tail deer from the Chocolate Mountains.  Several unique plant and animal species, including the fringe-tailed lizard, make their homes in the dunes.  From the Grays Well Road exit on Interstate 8, travelers can access Buttercup Campground, Midway Campgrounds, and the Plank Road.  The campgrounds along Grays Well Road offer hard surface parking, vault toilets, and trash facilities.  Buttercup Campground is also the site for our South Dunes Operations Center.  Although visited year round, during the summer months you need to be prepared for temperatures consistently exceeding 100? and reaching 120? on occasion.  However, like most of the California desert, the humidity is low and the nights cool down considerably.  Since the annual rain fall is less than 2", the only winter hazard is blowing sand.  Winter temperatures are typically in the 60-70? range. 2.	DESCRIPTION OF WORK AND SERVICES As a part of our mission to better serve the public, BLM with the help of an architecture firm have created a new operations center for the south dunes recreation area.  BLM is exploring other construction options to make better use of its financial resources and save time as well. The drawings referenced with this announcement are representative of the space usage for this 2,600 square foot facility.  It includes offices for our employees, a medical response room, it provides law enforcement with a civilian detainee holding area and an on-site workshop to house our much needed recreation vehicles.  This location requires an extensive amount of ground site work and utility installation.  The facility is designed to withstand the unique environment inhabited by the sand dunes.  Within this interest announcement, BLM-CDD is looking for a modular replication of the building provided in the drawings.  If interested, please respond with an itemized construction estimate be sure to include overhead and profit by April 7, 2006.  Drawings will be provided on a CD in .PDF format.  This is an interest announcement ONLY.

<DESC>This FedBizOpps notice is an announcement seeking market information on business/ organizations capable of providing the services as described herein.  This is a sources sought announcement and not a Request for Proposals (RFP).  It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  Responses will not be considered as proposals nor will any award be made as a result of this synopsis.  The applicable NAICS code is 541620 and the Size Standard is $6 million average annual receipt for the preceding three fiscal years.

We are in the preliminary planning phase for an A-76 study of portions of the Environmental Management function at Robins Air Force Base.  This function we previously studied in the 2001 timeframe, and the in-house Most Efficient Organization (MEO) was the successful offeror. 

We are currently conducting market research to determine whether a viable commercial industrial base exists which is qualified, experienced, and interested in performing this work in the future.  

Work currently performed by “third party contractors”, for example site remediation, are not and will not be included in this effort.  Due to the future potential for organizational conflicts of interest, it is expected that the successful offeror from any subsequent competition will be ineligible to compete for these third party contractor workloads.  Additional information concerning third party contractor workloads will be furnished at a later date to firms responding to this announcement.    

Robins AFB is the largest industrial complex in Georgia.  It occupies over 8,722 acres,  with 14M square feet of building space and a base population of approximately 23,000 civilian, military, and contractor employees and dependents.

Additional information concerning Robins’ Environmental Management program is available at www.em.robins.af.mil.  However, you are strongly cautioned against contacting any individuals identified therein as this may make you ineligible for any future competition for this workload.   

Companies who are qualified and/or experienced in all of the tasks described in the attached are invited to submit up to 25 double-spaced pages briefly describing their experience and capabilities for these tasks.  Company brochures are acceptable as long as they are sufficiently detained and the total submission does not exceed 25 pages.  Separately, we are also interested in common commercial contracting practices, including performance-based vs. task-oriented, pricing structure, length of contract, performance incentives, etc.  At this time, we are not interested receiving submissions from companies who do not have capabilities/experience in each of the listed tasks.  Any interested firm should submit an original and one copy of their capability statement that demonstrates the firm's ability to perform the key requirements described herein.  Responses must include the following: (1) Name and Address of the Organization, (2) Type of business (i.e. small business, disadvantaged, women-owned, veteran-owned etc), (3) Point of contact with name, title, phone, fax and email, (4) CAGE/DUNS number.  Any costs incurred as a result of responding to this announcement shall be borne by the respondent and cannot be charged to the Government for reimbursement.

Included in FEMA Region IV are the States of AL, FL, GA, KY, MS, NC, SC, and TN. Included in Region VI are the States of AR, LA, OK, NM and TX. The TAV system is a COTS system with modifications to meet FEMA cyber security requirements. Principal components include a Warehouse Management module to handle all inventory functions within FEMA’s two Logistics Centers in Atlanta, Georgia, and Fort Worth, Texas, and a Trading Partner Management module to handle shipping of all commodities and assets between locations within Region IV and VI geographical areas. The TAV system consists of two applications, Warehouse Management (WM) and Trading Partner Management (TPM), from Manhattan Associates. WM is used in FEMA’s Logistics Centers to manage warehouse operations such as receiving, stocking, and preparing shipments of commodities.  The WM application consists of multiple Linux Red Hat and Windows 2003 servers that host the application, web user interface, integration, and Oracle database. Within FEMA’s logistics centers, the WM application is accessed over wireless communications using forklift mounted tablet PC’s with wireless capability and wireless handheld scanning devices.  TPM is used by FEMA’s logistics managers to identify commodities stored at the various logistic centers that are to be distributed to State and local authorities and disaster victims.  The TPM applications reside on servers running Microsoft 2003, IIS web server, and SQL server technologies.

<DESC>Announcement:
THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TSA ACQUISITION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (TSAAMS).  The Transportation Security Administration intends to begin market research to obtain contract services to perform revenue administration services for Federal agencies.  These fees are imposed on multiple sectors of commerce and transportation.  Almost half of TSA’s approximately $5 billion annual budget is derived from these various transportation security fees.  

TSA intends to use the market research to determine a Qualified Vendor List (QVL) on a Small Business Set-Aside utilizing TSAAMS.  Contractors with experience performing revenue administration services as described below, for Federal agencies in the United States, are strongly preferred.  At the conclusion of evaluations for the potential solicitation, TSA may award a single Small Business contract to the successful offeror(s).  The NAICS Code for this requirement is 541219.  Contractors are required to either register with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) system (www.ccr.gov) prior to submitting a capability statement and so indicate, or they must provide sufficient information in their capability statement to establish their small business status; instructions are provided later in this document.  Companies wishing to seek further information pertaining to this requirement should contact Zelda Proctor at Zelda.Proctor@dhs.gov. 

Instructions:
TSA intends to conduct market research to identify Small Businesses who have the potential to fulfill the TSA revenue administration services requirement.  Interested contractors shall provide a capability statement of no more than 10 pages to Zelda Proctor at Zelda.Proctor@dhs.gov.  The statement must detail the contractor’s capabilities and experience in successfully performing services for the development, implementation, and regulation of Federal user fees for Federal agencies.  Additionally, 1 to 3 contract/task order references should be provided as proof of prior experience.  The references should describe work performed for other Federal agencies within the last 5 years.  The references should be submitted as a Word document (tables are okay), and for each reference cite contract title and description, contracting officer and COTR, names, email addresses, phone numbers, contract and/or task number, dates of performance, and total contract price.  Include a short description of the objectives of the contract and if the objectives were met.  The contractor must also submit resumes of the proposed key employees capable of performing the functions identified below.  A letter of commitment must accompany the resumes for either current or contingent hire employees.  The resumes must be no more than 2 pages and should directly reflect relevant skills and experiences sought below.  Resumes are to be in addition to the capabilities statement (up to 3 resumes for potential key employees for each position will be considered, though only a minimum of one is required).  Offerors are instructed to email their capability statements to the address listed above.  Because of security screening requirements, DO NOT use the US Postal Service or overnight express service.  Emailed capability statements must be in either one (1) PDF or one (1) Microsoft Word document of no more than 10 single sided pages.  The submission of capability statements are due no later than February 24, 2006 by 2:00pm EST.  Single or multiple attachments or exhibits (other than resumes) will not be opened or considered.  TSA will not pay bid preparation costs for any responses to this announcement nor will proprietary information be evaluated. 


Introduction/Requirements:
The positions to be filled will be located at the Transportation Security Administration’s Headquarters in Arlington, VA.  The contractor must be able to provide TSA with three (3) full time equivalent (FTE) positions.  Each task outlined below will be performed by one position:

Development of Transportation Security Fees (1 FTE) – Major skills, experiences and related deliverables include (but are not limited to) market analysis and estimation, program cost estimation based on extensive knowledge of cost accounting principles and methodologies, establishment of fee development processes and fee forecast vs. actual collections analysis. 

Implementation of Transportation Security Fees (1 FTE) – Major skills, experiences and related deliverables include (but are not limited to) the implementation of a revenue collections platform within the agency’s newly implemented Core Accounting System, (with specific technical knowledge of Oracle Financials as implemented in a Federal agency/department) development and documentation of revenue procedures for security fee invoicing and remittance, development and maintenance of customer account structure for invoicing and remittance, and revenue analysis activities to assess various trends and payment/collection performance (e.g. account aging reports, etc.)

Regulation of Transportation Security Fees (1 FTE) – Major skills, experiences and related deliverables include (but are not limited to) maintenance of revenue collection records, identification and maintenance of customer compliance issues in the OR contact database, coordination and issuance of compliance correspondence with more than 200 commercial air carriers, security fee audit assistance and analysis as required, and assistance in the development of Government claims for customer bankruptcy proceedings.

Selection Process for QVL:
TSA requirements will be evaluated on a GO, NO/GO basis.  Offerors who DO NOT meet the TSA requirements identified as GO, NO/GO criteria WILL NOT be evaluated further on TSA requirements criteria. Only Small Businesses that meet the TSA requirements will be placed on the Qualified Vendor List (QVL) and will be determined to have a reasonable chance to compete in the solicitation.

Due to the potential number of Small Businesses that may be interested in participating in the requirement, TSA will follow a down-select acquisition approach which is as follows:

1) Select Offerors determined qualified for the Qualified Vendor List (QVL) (Phase I)
2) Issue the solicitation to the QVL directly via email (Phase II)
3) Issue a Single awards based on the evaluation of offerors (Phase III)

The first phase is to establish one QVL specifically for this procurement. The QVL will pre-qualify offerors seeking to compete for this requirement through mandatory GO, NO/GO technical qualifications.  

Capability statements will determine the contractor to be a GO, NO/GO candidate if past performance provided meets the scope of criteria stated in sections “Announcement” and “Introduction/Requirements” and has demonstrated the ability to effectively develop, implement and regulate user fees for Federal agencies.  The establishment of the QVL will streamline the acquisition process and allow for TSA to maintain greater control of the contract competition.

To be considered qualified, the Small Business must demonstrate, through its past performance, that it performed equivalent user fee services (aforementioned reference information is required).

After establishing the QVL, TSA plans to implement the second phase of the procurement by issuing a Request for Proposals (RFP) to the Small Business on the QVL.  The result of the RFP will be to award a single Small Business Set-Aside contract to the offeror evaluated to present the best value in terms of required technical and cost capabilities.  The RFP will include the objectives of the requirement and information on the criteria and evaluation of the RFP responses.

Additional Information:
The solicitation, when issued will be sent directly to the Small Businesses selected for the QVL, via email. The Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database is a part of the Business Partner Network, an E-gov initiative, and will be used to validate vendor identity.  Prior to issuance of the RFP, all potential contractors must be registered in CCR. You may access CCR at the following URL: www.ccr.gov. All vendors must supply the following information in your capability statement: Business Size, Company’s CCR Registration Number (if applicable), Dun and Bradstreet Number (DUNS), Street and Mailing Addresses, Contact Person Name, Telephone Number, and E-Mail Address. As required by the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) beginning January 1, 2005, all vendors are required to complete the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.

<SUBJECT>A -- Lead Paint Test Kit Development; Request for Comments
<SOLNBR>LPTKD-1
<RESPDATE>041706
<ARCHDATE>04182006
<CONTACT>John  Schwemberger, Statistician, Phone 202-566-1972, Fax 202-566-0469, Email schwemberger.john@epa.gov
<DESC>Summary:

EPA is requesting information concerning the development of test kits or similar technologies for testing lead in paint that could be used by renovators, repair persons, and painters complying with a future EPA regulation for renovation, repair, and painting activities. This information will be considered in formulating EPA’s policy and research decisions regarding the development of lead paint test kits. The lead paint test kits will allow renovators, repair persons, and painters to focus resources and identify locations where lead-based paint is present and reliably determine situations where appropriate preventive actions should be undertaken. 

Background:

EPA’s proposed regulation for renovation, repair, and painting activities published in the January 10, 2006 Federal Register, and is available under docket ID number EPA–HQ– OPPT–2005–0049 at http:// www.regulations.gov/. You can also access the proposed rule directly at http://www.epa.gov/fedrgstr/EPA-TOX/ 2006/January/Day-10/t071.pdf. 

The proposed regulation calls for recognizing test kits that have a demonstrated probability of a negative response no more than 5% of the time for paint at or above the regulated lead level (i.e., kits with a false negative rate of no more than 5%). Under the proposed rule, these test kits could be used by trained and certified renovators in target housing to determine that the components affected by the renovation are free of lead-based paint. The proposed regulation also envisions the development of an improved, more accurate test kit that has: 

1. A demonstrated probability of a negative response no more than 5% of the time for paint at or above the regulated lead level (i.e., a false negative rate of no more than 5%). 
2. A demonstrated probability of a positive response no more than 10% of the time for paint below the regulated lead level (i.e., a false positive rate of no more than 10%). 

The planned effective dates of the renovation, repair, and painting regulation are based on improved test kits being commercially available approximately in 3 years. Readers seeking additional information, should refer to the proposed regulation published in the January 10, 2006 Federal Register.

Specifications:

EPA defines lead-based paint as any paint or other coating on a building component with either 1.0 milligrams or more lead per square centimeter or 0.5% or more lead by weight. The term ‘‘regulated lead level’’ refers to either of these two threshold numbers. A manufacturer, inventor, or vendor of a test kit or similar technology may choose either one of these numbers as the regulated level for demonstration and evaluation purposes. For the final regulation on renovation, repair, and painting activities, EPA would like a test kit or similar technology that meets the following specifications to be commercially available.  The specifications below are consistent with those in the proposed regulation published in the January 10, 2006 Federal Register, and provide additional detail. 
Specifications: 
1. False negative rate of no more than 5% for paint above or equal to the regulated level. 
2. False positive rate of no more than 10% for paint below the regulated level. 
3. Cost of under $2 per test. 
4. Test results to be available within an hour. Test kit includes quality control samples so users can make sure the test kit is working properly when the test is conducted. 
5. The test kit can be reliably used by a renovator, repair person, or painter who has completed training in the use of the test kit, and who has been certified by an EPA, State, territorial, or tribal lead program. The test kit provides consistent results when used by any trained and certified renovator, repair person, or painter. Required test kit training is to be minimal, 2–3 hours. 

In addition, EPA is interested in a test kit or similar technology that can be applied to any paint in pre-1978 housing units regardless of the type of material (wood, metal, plaster, drywall, brick, concrete, etc.) beneath the paint.

Request for Comments:

EPA is requesting information on test kits and similar technologies for testing lead in paint in the form of comments provided to the Agency no later than April 17, 2006. Comments are requested on the following topics: 

1. The feasibility of developing a test kit or similar technology that meets the specifications in this document. 
2. Manufacturers who have or could develop a test kit or similar technology that meets the specifications in this document 
3. Current test kits or similar technologies for testing lead in paint that may meet the specifications in this document. 
4. Future test kits or similar technologies for testing lead in paint that will be available in approximately the next 3 years that may meet the specifications described in this document.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA), Office of Transportation and Property Management (FB) is posting a Request for Information (RFI)/Sources Sought notice for express delivery services (exDS).  FB is seeking information in the form of industry comments regarding the draft Statement of Objectives (SOO) for the exDS Federal Strategic Sourcing Initiative (FSSI) posted in conjunction with this synopsis.  Responses are limited to vendors with existing capabilities to meet the requirements stated in the SOO.

This is a Request for Information/Sources Sought notice only.  This is not a Request for Proposals and in no way commits the Government to establish a procurement vehicle.  The Government does not intend to establish a procurement vehicle solely on submissions to this Request for Information/Sources Sought notice, nor does it intend to pay for any costs incurred in response to this notice.

On May 20, 2005, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued a memorandum instructing agencies to implement strategic sourcing, a process intended to leverage the collective buying power of the US Government.  Through agency collaboration, several commodities/services were identified as viable candidates for government-wide strategic sourcing efforts.  As a result, the FSSI, a consortium of agencies led by the Department of Treasury, was founded.  The FSSI group’s goals include:



Test the ability to strategically source across federal agencies;



Establish mechanisms to increase savings, value, and socio-economic participation;



Share good practices and build the strategic sourcing community of practice;



Learn lessons applicable to future strategic sourcing efforts at federal or agency levels;



Avoid unnecessary duplication of effort in pursuing OMB Strategic Sourcing Initiative.  



Federal commodity/service teams were developed from the FSSI that include express delivery services. The GSA, as the procurement arm of the Federal government, was asked to assist the commodity/service teams to provide acquisition support in achieving the FSSI goal to test the ability to strategically source across federal agencies.  This announcement addresses the strategic sourcing of exDS and offers a draft SOO that broadly describes the exDS commodity team needs for express delivery services.  

This RFI/Sources Sought notice seeks to identify potential sources and invite industry’s feedback and recommendations for improving the exDS requirements document in order to best achieve the expected outcomes under strategic sourcing:

Optimize performance
Reduce total overall cost
Increase achievement of socio-economic acquisition goals
Evaluate total life cycle management costs 
Improve vendor access to business opportunities, and
Otherwise increase the value of each dollar spent.

Written responses and questions are due to onthego@gsa.gov, subject line: Comments/Questions on FSSI exDS SOO, no later than 4:30 p.m. Eastern time, April 3, 2006.  In addition to written responses and questions, industry is invited to participate in an individual 1-hour presentation to address their capabilities to provide exDS as well as any feedback they have on the draft to the group.  The team is particularly interested in hearing how to best shape the effort to achieve strategic sourcing outcomes and make the effort attractive to industry.  

Specific questions industry should address include the following:  

•	What service level objectives should the Government consider and why?
•	What performance expectations should we consider and why?
•	How are pick up fees priced across the industry, if any?  
•	How should the pricing be structured to best achieve FSSI objectives while continuing to be attractive to industry?  
•	What data and e-solutions do you offer that will help each participating agency and the GSA to better manage exDS programs and how do they work to achieve better program management?  
•	What strategies can be employed to increase participation of small businesses in this industry?
•	What changes to the SOO will further enhance your ability to participate in this initiative?  
•	What else should the Government consider and why?

The information you provide will be used to ensure that requirements developed for any future solicitation maximizes efficiencies, competition and adopts commercial best practices.  Responses will be kept confidential.  If you have handouts, please deliver one electronic copy in a PDF or Powerpoint format no later than 4:30 p.m., Eastern time, April 3, 2006 to enable sufficient copies to be made prior to the presentations.  Elaborate handouts are NOT desired.

Industry is invited on a first-come, first serve basis to share its capabilities and feedback on April 4 and 5, 2006 at 2200 Crystal Drive, Room L1303S, Arlington, VA.  Contact Janet O’Meara on 703-605-2926 to schedule a time for your session.  Sessions are limited to vendors with existing capabilities to meet the requirements stated in the SOO.

<CONTACT>Elizabeth Hume, Conflict Specialist, Phone 202-712-4952, Fax 202-216-3453, Email ehume@usaid.gov
<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development, Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (USAID/DCHA) is seeking to gauge the level of interest and capabilities of contractors in developing, implementing, and evaluating democratic policing programs.

This announcement is a Request for Information (RFI), not a Request for Proposals (RFP) and is not to be construed as a commitment by USAID/DCHA to issue any solicitation or ultimately to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or otherwise to pay for any information submitted as a result of this request.  The requested information will assist USAID/DCHA to plan future procurements in democratic policing.  However, it should be noted that responding to this RFI will not give any advantage to any firm under any subsequent RFP.

In recent years, an increasing number of countries in which USAID operates have suffered from insecurity and lawlessness.  Compounding the problem is endemic state incapacity to protect citizens, or worse, the complicity of government officials. This directly affects development progress in these countries, and has led to increased donor focus on the relationship between security and development, and the need to address weaknesses and advance reform in the security sector. Given their primary responsibility for establishing and maintaining order and security, civilian police are increasingly a focus for all donors, including USAID.

USAID support to foreign law enforcement entities has been strictly limited since 1975 by Section 660(a) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended.  A number of statutory exceptions to that prohibition subsequently have been enacted, including limited authority to finance community-based policing activities.  Section 564(a) of the FY 2006 foreign operations appropriations act continues this authority on a world-wide basis.  Specifically, that authority is

“to enhance the effectiveness and accountability of civilian police authority through training and technical assistance in human rights, the rule of law, strategic planning, and through assistance to foster civilian police roles that support democratic governance, including assistance for programs to prevent conflict, respond to disasters, address gender-based violence, and foster improved police relations with the communities they serve.”  

While USAID has financed training and other related activities with foreign police under Administration of Justice and Rule of Law authorities and, more recently, under its community-based policing authority, the Agency is currently working to further develop its expertise in this area and educate other US agencies and donors on USAID’s critical role.  Accordingly, USAID seeks to strengthen its capacity to: conduct police assessments; design and monitor police programs; evaluate programs; and develop technical guidance and best practices.
USAID’s assistance to police will be integrated as part of rule of law or security sector reform programs, and will contribute to broader goals of justice sector reform, democratic governance, and/or conflict mitigation and management.  As such, USAID may focus on the following areas:
o	Institutional capacity building (i.e., developing modern leadership, supervisory and management skills within law enforcement institutions)
o	Institutional/sector strategic planning (i.e, developing strategic planning, policy formulation and fiscal management capacities)
o	Change management
o	Community-police relationships; 
o	Links among police and the rule of law (i.e., strengthening police-prosecutor relationships particularly with respect to investigations, developing holistic approaches, and integrating systems) 
o	Institutional performance oversight (i.e., developing and integrating oversight capacity, such as internal affairs offices, disciplinary units, inspectors general, auditors, legislative committees, police and/or human rights commissions; ombudsmen, etc.)
o	Civil society/civilian oversight (i.e., strengthening civil society capacity to engage on police issues, monitor activities, and demand accountability)
o	Technical assistance to improve human rights performance
o	Decentralization of the police 
o	Legislative reform on police issues  
o	Border management;
o	Anti-corruption activities;
Requested Information:

1.  Contractors should provide the following:

(a) Describe the contractor’s capabilities in the technical areas listed above.  The information should include a description of any overseas projects implemented by your firm that supported the development of indigenous democratic police.

<SUBJECT>B -- Analysis of the Impacts of Water Resource Management Choices in Ceara, Brazil
<DESC>This is a special notice as the Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) intends to negotiate a single source purchase order using Simplified Acquisition procedures with the Columbia University, New York, NY, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253c(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005 -07.  

The NOAA Climate Program Office seeks to acquire technical support services for the analysis of the Impacts of Water Resource Management Choices in Ceara, Brazil (see the following Statement of Work).  The period of performance for this requirement is expected to be one year and the budgeted amount is $26,000. 

Based on prior NOAA market research, conducted, Columbia University is the only source holding the unique combination of experience, skills, and abilities to analyze the Impacts of Water Resource Management Choices in Ceara, Brazil.  Notwithstanding the Government’s intent to negotiate this requirement with Columbia University, under the authority of 41 USC253(c)(1), responsible sources may submit a statement of qualifications which, if timely received, will be considered by NOAA.  Responses must be received by March 28, 2006.  Responses may be faxed to (301) 713-0806 or e-mailed to sandra.shaffner@noaa.gov. 
..........Statement of Work..........

PURPOSE

The NOAA, Office of Global Programs requires assistance with coordinating the analysis of the Companhia de Gestão dos Recursos Hidricos (COGERH) database to estimate the numbers within each user group in this region, and estimate levels of water use. Also on quantitative inference from the Finan database on rained agriculturalists to extract the lessons usable for impacts on rained of water management policies as well as the possible effects of long-run development policies to lower vulnerability through employment in urban centers.  In particular the analysis of the data concerning the pilot experiments in water policy already conducted, including the Aguas do Vale experiments, and the design and analysis of a specialized sub-survey concerning willingness to pay for water.

TASKS

The contractor will design the broadly implemented survey of user characteristics, activities, and responses to shocks to anticipated and actual water availability (the responses part of the survey will also benefit from an expert). Coordination of the quantitative inference from databases and surveys together that inform the Decision Support (DS) tool will generate simulated outcomes of interest for relevant water policy scenarios.

The contractor will coordinate the hydrologic analysis of the existing Ceara, Brazil, reservoir and water supply system, following on work done jointly with Assis Filho at Fundação Cearense de Meteorlogia e Recursos Hidricos (FUNCEME).  This is a crucial element in the DS tool if we are to address Policy 1 – “The basing of reservoir releases upon climate-index-based stream-flow forecasts.”  Within the DS tool this will be coordinated with the analysis and the post doc of stakeholder characteristics, since the point of the DS tool is to spell out clearly the implications for the suite of water users of each of the relevant water policy options.

The contractor will lead the quantitative inference from the databases and surveys that will inform the DS tool, so that for very specific policy options a clear estimate of outcomes for all relevant stakeholders can be calculated. The contractor will also lead for the development of the DS tool itself and coordinate its use in the game and scenario exercises jointly with local policy makers.

Building on previous work on use and display of probabilistic information, the contractor will lead the creation of an interactive interface (funded outsider of this proposal but designed within it) that permits local policy makers and user representatives, and eventually participants in the water allocation seminars, to see in real-time the impacts on all stakeholder of leading policy options.

The project investigators will analyze the impacts of shifts in water allocation and reservoir system operation in the two largest and most populated water basins (Jaguaribe and Metropolitano) in the state of Ceará in northeast Brazil.  The researchers will concentrate on the variation in benefits and costs across the wide range of stakeholders who live in these basins that are prone to recurrent, multi-year droughts; they will focus on the potential roles for climate information and for participatory decision-making.  Developing an understanding of how proposed shifts in water resource management will affect the residents in different scenarios will help local policy makers formulate equitable and efficient policy.  The investigators will work with local policy makers to develop and test decision support tools. They will employ a variety of techniques including ethnographic and survey methods, analysis of existing data sets, quantitative inference and modeling to develop a decision tool to inform policy choice.

The University of Miami is taking the lead in the design and testing of the survey instrument and in conducting the ethnographic fieldwork.  Columbia University is helping with design of the survey instrument and also supporting the ongoing refinement of the reservoir release regime modeling that will be used later in the project.

DELIVERABLES:  

	1)  Progress Report – due six (6) months after effective date of contract.
	2)  Final Report – due twelve (12) months after effective date of contract.

<SUBJECT>R -- Research Support on Ensemble Dispersion Modeling
<DESC>This is a special notice as the Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) intends to negotiate a single source purchase order using Simplified Acquisition procedures with Jerome Heffter, Bethesda, MD, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253c(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005 -07.  

The NOAA Air Resources Laboratory seeks to acquire technical support services for the processing of a manuscript through the publication process and updating the meteorological data base in a format compatible with the ARL Dispersion Models (see the following Statement of Work).  The period of performance for this requirement is expected to be nine months year and the budgeted amount is $15,000. 

Based on prior NOAA market research, conducted, Jerome Heffter is the only source holding the unique combination of experience, skills, and abilities to make changes to the manuscript.  Notwithstanding the Government’s intent to negotiate this requirement with Jerome Heffter, under the authority of 41 USC253(c)(1), responsible sources may submit a statement of qualifications which, if timely received, will be considered by NOAA.  Responses must be received by March 31, 2006.  Responses may be faxed to (301) 713-0806 or e-mailed to sandra.shaffner@noaa.gov. ..........Statement of Work:  Research Support on Ensemble Dispersion Modeling.....

Background:
The increasing concern with the release of potentially hazardous materials into the atmosphere highlights the importance of evaluating a forecast of the transport and spread of these materials.  The NOAA/Air Resources Laboratory (ARL) is continuing the development of methods to assess the reliability of dispersion forecasts.

Objectives:
The project is a continuation of last year’s contract which developed statistical techniques for the interpretation of the reliability of ARL atmospheric dispersion model forecasts.  A technical paper describing the methodology has been completed, but now must be passed through the peer review processes, which will require further modification and editing.  

The second part to this contract will be to assemble the most recent compilation of high-resolution meteorological data files generated by NOAA and reformat them for use in ARL dispersion models.  This meteorological data base can then be used to continue the reliability testing of ARL dispersion modeling methods.  

Deliverable A:
In collaboration with ARL office staff, the manuscript “ Forecast Area Reliability for Airborne Volcanic Ash” delivered under NOAA contract  EA133R-05-SE-4732,  will be modified to make it acceptable for publication in Weather and Forecasting.  The first draft has been completed, and it will need to pass through the NOAA review prior to journal submission.  After submission the journal’s peer reviewers may require further changes before (and if) it is accepted for publication.  The contractor will shepherd the paper through this process making changes as necessary.  

Deliverable B:
Transfer, reformat, and archive meteorological data fields from the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) recently compiled at the NOAA National Center for Environmental Prediction at ARL for the purpose of re-examining several past tracer experiments conducted by ARL. These experiments include: 1) The Atlantic Coast Unique Regional Atmospheric Tracer Experiment (ACURATE - 1982, 1983); 2) The Cross-Appalachian Tracer Experiment (CAPTEX – 1983); and, 3) The Across North America Tracer Experiment (ANATEX – 1987).  The NARR has been derived from the 6-hour 120 km Global Reanalysis (GR) for the period 1979 – 2003.  NARR data are available at 3-hour intervals on a 32 km grid at 45 atmospheric layers.  The above tracer experiments have been examined in two previous contracts using the coarse resolution GR data. The re-examination in this contract will update the previous research by making use of the finer time and space scale NARR data.  The contractor will reformat these data files in a format compatible with ARL dispersion models. 


Evaluation Criteria:

1) Knowledge of NOAA-NCEP ensemble meteorological products,
2) Experience configuring and running HYSPLIT,
3) Co-author of manuscript “Forecast Area Reliability for Airborne Volcanic Ash,” and 
4) Previous Journal publications in dispersion modeling and tracer experiment data analysis.

<SUBJECT>--U.S. Army Communications Electronics Life Cycle Management Command Acquisition Center  Washingtons intention to issue a modification to increase the ceiling price of contract DAAB15-02-D-1007
<DESC>The U.S. Army Communications Electronics Life Cycle Management Command Acquisition Center  Washingtons (AMSEL-AC-W) intends to issue a sole source modification to increase the ceiling price of contract DAAB15-02-D-1007 by $68,826,658.80, from $53,0 75,000.00 to $121,901,658.80.  Contract DAAB15-02-D-1007 is a firm fixed price, indefinite delivery indefinite quantity type contract for the hardware, software and services required to install the Integrated Commercial Intrusion Detection System (ICIDS) I II at U.S. Army installations.  The contract was awarded on 10 September 2002 to Radian, Inc. of 5845 Richmond Highway, Suite 725, Alexandria, VA 22303 with a 1 year base ordering period and four (4) 1-year ordering period options extending the potential c ontract ordering period through 09 September 2007.  Options extending ordering through 09 September 2006 have already been exercised, leaving 1 option still available for exercise.  The maximum ordering total for equipment and services was established in t he contract as $53,075,000.00.  This estimate was based on the Governments tentative schedule for the installation of ICIDS-III at 16 Army sites.   Since the time of award, the Army has issued 43 orders and completed ICIDS-III installation at 14 sites with a total order value of $44,909,658.80.  The Government expects to issue additional orders for 3 additional sites that will make the total value of orders equal to the current maximum order amount by 31 March 2006.  In addition to these efforts, the Army has also identified requirements for the installation of ICIDS-III at 20 sites between 01 April 2006 and the final 09 September 2007 date for complet e expiration of the contract ordering period.  These additional sites are estimated to require $68,826,658.80 in additional effort by the contractor. The current ICIDS-III Contracting Officer, Mr. Pearse A. McDade, considers the issuance of a bilateral modification to increase the maximum ordering amount of the contract by $68,826,658.80, from $53,075,000.00 to $121,901,658.80 and the exercise of the fi nal contract option carrying the ordering period to 09 September 2007 to be in the best interest of the Government because it is the only way to allow for the continued uninterrupted installation of ICIDS-III at U.S. Army bases while providing for the full  and open competition of a follow-on contract.  A failure to continue these installations while recompeting the contract for these services would result in an unacceptable delay in the continued installation of ICIDS for the Army. Concurrent with the continued performance of the ICIDS-III contract by Radian, Inc under the new contract ceiling, the Government will be conducting a full and open competition for a follow-on contract to be known as ICIDS-IV.  In furtherance of this compe tition for ICIDS-IV, a pre-solicitation notice was posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website (http://www.fedbizopps.gov/) by the U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC) on 03 February 2006 under solicitation number W9113M -06-R-0011.  The SMDC point of contact for this effort is Mr. Greg Florey.  Mr. Florey may be reached by phone at (301) 619-8427, or via email at greg.florey@det.amedd.army.mil.  The estimated value of the ICIDS-IV effort is $200 Million, the anticipated p eriod of performance is one base year with four options and award of the contract is expected in November 2006.  Comprehensive testing and validation of the successful offerors system will preclude the full commencement of ICIDS-IV contract installations until 1st Quarter FY 2008.	  Questions regarding this synopsis and the increase to the maximum ordering total of contract DAAB15-02-D-1007 may be addressed to the ICIDS-III Contracting Officer, Mr. Pearse A. McDade, at telephone (703) 325-0410, facsimile (703) 325-4995, or email pears e.mcdade@cacw.army.mil.  It is anticipated that the modification discussed herein will be executed wi th the contractor Radian, Inc. by 31 March 2006.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION OF INTENT: THIS IS A MARKET SURVEY REQUESTING INFORMATION IN SUPPORT OF THE FOLLOWING POTENTIAL REQUIREMENT.  No contract will be awarded from this announcement.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a forthcomin g solicitation, nor is it a request seeking contractors to be placed on a solicitation mailing list.  Response to this survey is voluntary and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this market surv ey and any follow-on information requests.  Data submitted in response to this market survey will not be returned.  No solicitation document exists at this time, and calls requesting a solicitation will not be answered. POTENTIAL REQUIREMENT: TARDEC is conducting a market survey to identify advanced capabilities for a Mobile Over Snow Transport (MOST). This system is intended to enhance mission capability by providing a mobility platform to meet both tactical and logistic al functions while operating in areas that are covered with snow.  The MOST will be employed for transportation in an artic/snow-covered environment in support of both tactical and direct action missions.  The MOST will be used to infiltrate/exfiltrate are as and navigate over extremely long distances from the insertion point to the target area. TARDEC is interested in utilizing a Modified Commercial Off-The-Shelf (M-COTS) vehicle that can be further developed with a limited and short term effort to meet the described tactical and logistical functions.  It is the intent of this survey to gain info rmation which may be utilized to facilitate the finalization of a requirement which will maximize, to the greatest extent possible, COTS vehicles that can be readily adapted to meet the Proposed Performance Objectives (PPO) described in Appendix A of this market survey.  Type of system desired: The MOST is envisioned as a commercially based vehicle with peculiar modifications, modular storage racks for equipment, companion sled and MOST transport trailer.  MOST operations will include around-the-clock, all weather use in cold climates at varying altitudes up to 12,500 ft.  Operational temperature may vary between -50F and +40F. The following specific aspects of the MOST are of interest: 1) Mobility, 2) Artic climate and geographical operation capability, including snow covered areas, tundra grasslands, forest, urban areas, and mountains, 3) Operation at varying altitudes with min imal configuration changes, 4) Ability to transport two operators,  5) Capable of supporting worldwide deployment in all terrains and climates, 6) 100 mile minimum range capability, 7) Ability to tow a companion sled (un-powered.) RESPONSES DUE: Responses to the Market Survey are requested no later than April, 17, 2006 and shall not exceed 50 pages of text. RESPONSE FORMAT(S): ELECTRONIC:  Electronic responses are preferred and strongly encouraged.  It is requested that electronic responses be provided in any of the following formats:  Microsoft word, Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Power Point.  The maximum size of each e-mail sh ould be not more than three and one-half (3.5) megabytes.  You may use multiple e-mail messages.  The subject line must include message 1 of 3, 2 of 3, 3 of 3 etc., as well as [Organization Name].  All interested entities *e.g. companies, non-profit organi zations, and academic institutes), regardless of size, are encouraged to respond to this request for information.  Please submit electronic responses and any questions prior to full response to Walter Baker via email at bakerw@tacom.army.mil.  Please forma t the subject line of the response email as follows; [Organization Name] response to NAC-2006-02(15618).  A questionnaire for the Proposed Performance Objectives (PPO) will be posted to PROC-NET (http://contracting.tacom.army.mil/ssn/sources.htm). GENERAL INFORMATION: The Government appreciates the time and effort taken to respond to this survey.  The Government acknowledges its obligations under 18 U.S.C. §1905 to protect information qualifying as CONFIDENTIAL under this statute.  Pursuant to this statute, the Government is willing to accept any trade secret or confidential restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response to the survey questions and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following:    1.  Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data as trade secret or confidential with the restrictive legend (all caps) CONFIDENTIAL with any explanatory text, so that the Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected. 2.  In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly trade secret or confidential (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as CONFIDENTIAL may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your respo nse - see item 6 below). Use circling,underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected.  3 The Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data. Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the Government will not be protected once in the public domain.  Data already in the possession of the Government will be protected in accordance with the Government's rights in the data,   4. Confidential data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the government, shall contain any restrictive legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and at the begin ning of the file itself.  Where appropriate for portions only of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends CONFIDENTIAL DATA BEGINS: and CONFIDENTIAL PORTION ENDS. 5. In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text. 6. The Government sometimes uses support contractors in evaluating responses. Consequently, responses that contain confidential information may receive only limited or no consideration since the Respondents marking of data as Confidential will preclude disclosure of same outside the Government and therefore will preclude disclosure to these support contractors assisting the evaluation effort.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR part 12. The request for quote will be in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation: proposals ae being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. 
Purpose of Contract
Division of Tuberculosis Elimination (DTBE), Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), seeks a vendor to provide the following services:
1.	To provide computer programming expertise leading to the modification of an existing application, named  Tuberculosis Indicators Project (TIP).
2.	To implement additional programming based on necessary enhancements of the TIP application to enable all jurisdictions funded by and report to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention  to use this application for monitoring program progress toward national TB objectives. 
3.	To deploy this application and provide technical support and documentation to all users.
 
Background
Accelerating progress toward TB elimination requires new efforts and priorities.  Program evaluation is an essential component of successful programs and a mechanism for TB programs to reach the goal of TB elimination. Survey findings and discussions with state partners identified the evaluation needs of local TB program staff.  In the process, Evaluation Working Group’s (EWG) vision evolved. The vision of EWG, as stated in the Strategic Plan, a document detailing the goals and the action steps of EWG, are: 
-   TB programs routinely conduct self-evaluations and use findings to improve and enhance programs
-   Data systems are in place to collect and organize data for evaluation purposes
-   Standard indicators for program performance are developed and reported to CDC 
-   Evaluation findings are used to make systemic changes
-   Lessons learned from evaluations are shared between programs
 
To address the needs of TB program staff at the state and local levels, and realize the vision of EWG, Division of Tuberculosis Elimination (DTBE) EWG is planning and developing a coordinated web-based system that includes 3 major functions in public health programs: (1) program planning, (2) outcome monitoring, and (3) program evaluation. As activities are planned and implemented, outcome indicators are monitored to see how the program is performing.  If a program is doing well or poorly, it can be evaluated to understand why. The knowledge from the evaluation can then be used for planning improvements to enhance the program. These 3 functions operate simultaneously for optimal program performance and success. 
 
Leveraging existing resources and application within the field of Tuberculosis prevention programs, the development of part 2, outcome monitoring component, of the system will be built based on the existing Tuberculosis Indicators Program (TIP).  This application will unify and standardize indicators of program performance reported to CDC. In addition, it will promote the use data currently being collected in Public Health data systems (i.e., Report of Verified Cases of Tuberculosis and Aggregated Report for Program Evaluation) for the purpose of conducting program evaluation and making program improvements.  
The existing TIP system was implemented using a multi-tier architecture using various Off The Shelf (OTS) software.  Listed below is a brief description of the various tiers and the major technologies that were used.
Presentation Tier:  Web based interface for users to request analytical reports using Microsoft Application Service Provider
Reporting Engine: Design of  TIP report templates in Crystal Reports 8.5 based on XML data sources.  The system uses the Report Designer Component (RDC) library to merge the data into the templates and produce a PDF document.  The system extracts data from the Reporting database based on the user’s selection.
Analytical Tier:  Processing of raw data from the Surveillance system into summary data as required by the TIP templates. Also performs necessary data cleansing prior to processing. SAS programs are executed in batch to produce reporting data in the form of ASCII delimited files. The analysis is usually performed by the data managers on their desktops or servers.
Reporting Database Tier: The ASCII delimited files from the above analytical process are imported into the reporting database. The reporting database is Microsoft Access.
The existing TIP system currently provides indicator calculations for TB programs within the state of California. To provide the system for use by TB programs across the United States, the existing TIP system needs to be modified to reflect national indicator calculations if different from the national standarized calculation, accommodate data gathered at the national level from Tuberculosis Information Management System (TIMS) and Tuberculosis Surveillance Program Area Module (TB PAM), and enable reporting jurisdictions to access data within their jurisdiction and perform automatic reporting of indicators for national TB objectives. Data includes, but not limited to, those from Report of Verified Cases of Tuberculosis (RVCT) and Aggregated Report for Program Evaluation (ARPE).   
Access to the TIP system will be granted to perspective vendors for assessment before the submission of the project proposal. 
This statement of work is written to seek the needed computer programming expertise to modify TIP for use by TB programs across the United States.  To successfully and efficiently complete the modification of TIP for national use, this project is divided into 3 phases: (I) System assessment and evaluation, (II) System development and modification, and (III) System deployment and user support.

1.3.3.	MISSING/LOST ARTICLES.  The contractor will deliver any articles missing from a delivery by the next regular scheduled delivery at no additional charge to the government.

1.5.	GENERAL INFORMATION

1.5.3.	MOTOR VEHICLE OPERATION ON BASE.  Contractor personnel are advised that seat belt usage is mandatory at all times while operating a motor vehicle on base.  Montana state law requires the use of restraints in a vehicle.  Air Force Instruction 31.204, Air Force Motor Traffic Supervision, prescribes that installation commanders must ensure drivers comply with state and local traffic laws both on and off base.  Accordingly, while on Malmstrom AFB, operators and passengers must wear restraints and may be ticketed by Security Forces personnel for failure to comply.

1.7.	QUALITY CONTROL PLAN.  The Contractor shall establish and maintain a complete Quality Control Plan (QCP) to ensure the requirements of this SOW are provided as specified.  The Contractor shall develop quality control procedures addressing the areas identified in paragraph 2., Services Summary.

The plan shall include procedures for in-process controls of laundry and dry-cleaning processes.

1.7.1.	The Contractor’s QCP shall:

	-	Be in addition to the requirements of the agreement; if a disagreement arises between the QCP and the agreement, the language of the agreement shall control.

	-	Contain documentation of all contractor quality control, process control, process measurement, and output indicator checks and corrective actions be maintained by the Contractor throughout the life of the agreement.

specify the areas to be inspected, how the inspection will be documented, and the title of the individual(s) who will perform the inspection.

	-	The procedures used to identify and prevent deficiencies in the quality of service performed before the level of performance becomes unacceptable.  This will include procedures for a method of inspection to assure proper temperatures, bleaches, blueing, chemical rinse, (sour) detergents and other additives are adhered to.

1.7.2.	Quality Status Report (QSR).  After performance of six (6) calls, the Contractor shall generate a QSR, providing insight into both the status of issues affecting quality and the Contractor's self-assessment of their performance on the agreement.

1.7.3.	Records of all inspections conducted by the Contractor and necessary corrective action taken shall be made available to the Government during the agreement term

1.7.4.	WASHROOM TESTS.  Every third call, the Contractor shall perform washroom tests in accordance with laboratory instructions by processing two laundry test pieces (swatches of material) in the washing of items picked up at Malmstrom AFB linen exchange.  Test results shall meet the established laboratory standard of “Acceptable.”  In the event test results are “Unacceptable,” the Contractor shall take necessary corrective action within five (5) working days and retest.  The process shall be repeated until test results meet “Acceptable” industry standards.  Two (2) copies of test results shall be provided to the Government not later than five (5) workdays from the date of receipt of test results by the Contractor from the laboratory.

1.7.5.	TESTS BY AN INDEPENDENT LABORATORY.  The Contractor shall obtain washroom test services from INTERNATIONAL FABRICARE INSTITUTE (IFI), 12251 Tech Road, Silver Spring, MD  20904.

1.7.6.	WORKMANSHIP AND SANITATION.  Delivered finished articles shall conform to the generally accepted industry standards of quality of cleanliness, finish, and appearance.

1.7.8.	RE-PERFORMANCE OF LAUNDERING/DRY CLEANING.  Any item found to not meet requirements of paragraphs 1.8.6. and paragraphs 2.1., 2.2., 2.3., and 2.6. of Appendix A shall be re-cleaned at no additional cost to the Government.  The Contractor shall pack the re-cleaned items separately, identify date with which they were originally returned, and mark “Attention QAE.”

1.7.9.	PERSONNEL REQUIREMENTS.  The contractor must identify a Project Manager (PM) and alternate who is able to address issues and concerns that may arise during the performance of this agreement.

1.8.	PERFORMANCE PLAN.  The QAE will evaluate the Contractor’s performance in accordance with the Inspection of Services clause (FAR 52.246-4).  The government QAE will reject, to the Contractor, individual deliveries of laundry and/or dry cleaning that do not meet established SOW requirements.  The Contractor will sort the lot to remove unserviceable items as necessary, and represent the lot to the QAE for inspection.

1.8.1. 	PERFORMANCE EVALUATION MEETINGS.  The Contractor’s PM may be required to meet with the QAE and the Contracting Officer, as necessary, during the performance of the agreement.  However, if the Contractor requests, a meeting may be held whenever a Customer Complaint is issued.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation, N00173-06-R-DB04, is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through FAC 2005-08 and DFARS Change Notice 20060223. The associated small business size standard is 334511 and 750 employees. Specifications:  CLIN 0001:  Quantity of 64 omni-directional hydrophones that are to be used as receiver elements in a 2-dimensional underwater acoustic array (Billboard Array). The goal is to obtain hydrophones that are nearly identical in performance, and that achieve a minimum sensitivity, bandwidth, and omni-directionality. A secondary but still very important goal is that the hydrophones be constructed in such a way that they can be mounted into a structural frame that NRL is building. Initially this frame will be a spherical lattice of thin rods with mounts for the hydrophones at the vertices. The mounts will firmly hold the preamplifier housings in places, with the sensitive receiving elements projecting outwards from the sphere. These hydrophones are to be high-fidelity units that are fairly small and lightweight. (Details of the physical requirements are given below.) Since we sometimes need to use long lengths of cable on these hydrophones (initially up to 100 meters, but this will later be extended to several hundred meters), the hydrophones must have a built-in differential signal preamplifier at the receiver element, and include a high pass filter to prevent saturation from the effects of surface waves. Other considerations include the size and weight of the hydrophone and preamplifier housing, the size of the underwater cable, and the physical robustness of the entire assembly. Usable Frequency Range shall be 15Hz to 480 kHz or higher. Sensitivity:  Minus 186 dB re 1V/microPa or better over the usable frequency range, Must not vary by more than plus or minus 3 dB over this usable frequency range, Must not vary by more than plus or minus 2 dB in the frequency range 15 Hz to 200 kHz. and Each hydrophone should come with an individual calibration chart showing its Receiving Sensitivity over its usable frequency range. Directivity: Horizontal (radial x-y plane); Omni-directional to plus or minus 2 dB or less below 100 kHz, and Omni-directional to plus or minus 3 dB or less at 100 to 300 kHz, Vertical (axial x-z plane); Over 270 Degrees, plus or minus 2 dB or less at 100 kHz and Over 270 Degrees, plus or minus 3 dB or less at 100 to 300 kHz. Preamplifier: Gain: Fixed, in the range 25 to 30 dB, DC Supply: 12 to 24 V. (Supply will be furnished by NRL.)3.	The DC power supply of 12 to 24 volts is provided as a range to accommodate specific voltage requirements of the items delivered. Power Consumption: 50 mW or less. Max. cable length drive capability: 1000 meters or more.
Hi-pass filtering: 15Hz, 3dB/Octave roll-off or better. And Noise: Above 1 kHz, equivalent spectral noise pressure level must be 45 dB re 1V/microPa or less. Below 1 kHz, equivalent spectral noise pressure level must be below Seastate Zero level. (By this, we mean lower than 45 dB re 1V/microPa at 1 kHz, rising to 75 dB re 1V/microPa down at 10 Hz.). Calibration: Provision must be made to be able to provide a calibration signal to the preamplifier down the cable, for the purpose of checking the correct operation of the unit. Operating Conditions (continuous): Minus 2 Degrees C or lower to 50 Degrees C or higher and Depths of 900 meters or greater. The units will be subjected to oceanic salt water environments for periods of weeks at a time. Physical: The cables must be detachable from the body of the hydrophone/preamplifier units. This must be achieved through any of a number of industry standard watertight connectors that are readily available commercially, and can easily maintain a watertight connection down to depths of 900 meters. Typically these connectors push together to achieve an electrical connection, and then an outer screw mechanism is engaged to compress an o-ring, thus achieving a physically secure link that is also watertight. NRL requires a commonly available connector of this type on the units being purchased here. The other end of the cables will be pig-tails (no termination). The hydrophone, preamplifier housing, and connector (that will mate to the cable) must all form a single, rigid unit. In other words, once the preamplifier housing is firmly held in one position, there can be no relative motion of either the hydrophone receiving element (the ceramic) or the watertight connector. The cables and connectors must be at least 7 conductor, one being for ground, two for signals (since the preamplifier is differential), one for DC power supply, one for cable shield, one for sending a calibration signal to the preamplifier, and at least one as a spare. The cable should include a 500lbs strain relief, and be water blocked with a material that can withstand a salt water environment, such as polyurethane. The cable OD should be around 1cm. (Smaller cables are acceptable, but any larger than 1.1cm diameter is unacceptable.) The preamplifier housing must be cylindrical in shape, with the cylindrical axis aligned with the axis of acoustical symmetry. This housing must be rigidly constructed of a metal that will be resistant to corrosion from salt water (for example, stainless steel or aluminum bronze). Its outer diameter must not exceed 4 cm (smaller would be preferable), and its length must be at least than 5cm but no longer than 15cm (not including the connector on the rear of the unit). The tip of the receiving element (the ceramic) must extend away from the body of the preamplifier housing by 10cm (plus or minus 1 cm), and must be protect by a chloroprene rubber skin or some other material that will be resistant to salt water environments while still being acoustically transparent. A smaller size to the active element is preferable, and together with its protective skin should have a diameter of no more than 1.5 cm (smaller would be preferable).	Each hydrophone/preamplifier integral unit, when detached from the cable in air, must weigh no more than 1.5 lbs.  Delivery and acceptance is at NRL, Washington, D.C. 20375, FOB Destination. The contractor shall deliver the hydrophones no later than sixty (60) days after contract award. The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial, applies to this acquisition.  The provision at FAR 52.212-2,Evaluation--Commercial Items is incorporated. The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to that responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate the offers: (i) Technical capability of the item offered to meet the Government’s requirement; (ii) Past Performance; and (iii) Price. Technical capability and Past Performance, when combined, are more important than price. Offeror must complete and submit with its proposal, FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications--Commercial Items and DFARs 252.212-7000 Offeror Representations and Certifications--Commercial Items, which are identified as B and available electronically at: http://heron.nrl.navy.mil/contracts/repsandcerts.htm

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 3 TO THE COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFP FOR SOFTWARE DEFINED RADIO REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATION DEVELOPMENT PLATFORM.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to 1) Extend the proposal due date, 2) Revise proposal submittal information, 3) Revise the Delivery Date, 4) Revise the Statement of Work, and 5) Answer questions received before the Question Submittal Deadline. 1) The due date for receipt of offers is extended to 5:00 PM EDT, Tuesday, April 11th, 2006.   2) Offers submitted via e-mail must contain a CC to Karin.E.Huth@nasa.gov in addition to submittal to Daniel.Rodriguez-1@nasa.gov .  Information for proposals sent via postal mailing remains unchanged.  Offerors are still responsible for ensuring that their respective proposals and e-mails are received.	  3) References of a Delivery Date of "thirty (30) days ARO" (in both the Combination Synopsis/ RFP and the Statement of Work)shall read "sixty (60) days ARO." 4) The Evaluation Criteria of the Statement of Work (SOW) has been revised.  Item #10 shall be inserted and shall read as follows: The ability to meet a sixty (60) day Delivery Schedule.  Additional value will be given to those proposals who can meet a 30 day delivery to NASA GRC. 5) The following questions, submitted before the Question Submittal Deadline, are being answered (questions are paraphrased): Q1: What levels of radiation is NASA interested in for the FPGAs.  Also, is there a concern for FPGA parts only? A1: The objective is to have a path to the family of parts for radiation tolerance.  A specification of radiation tolerance is not available.	Other components specified (e.g. power PC) have a path to a space part.	We are less concerned about the DSP as we did not specifically require a DSP in the delivered system. Q2: If an input to the modem is wideband and multiple channels can fit into the band, is this acceptable? A2: The specification calls for a 70 MHz IF for compatibility with other lab systems.  A vendor provided downconverter to 70 MHz is acceptable. Q3: The data path for the modulator and demodulator is fully configurable and runs on a C++ processor.	The C++ code can be easily modified and may affect other system functions.  Do you expect to modify the C++ code?   A3: The proposal should provide what reconfigurable capability is provided by the platform and what NASA has access to modify and control.  The tools provided with the platform shall allow NASA to reconfigure the operational parameters. Q4: Documentation development to support the lab environment is required for boards built as part of a deployable communications system (i.e.: includes router, RF, and antenna elements).  This would be bid as a contract component and be included in the 30 day delivery window.  Is it possible to modify the delivery date? A4: The RFP has been modified to accept a longer delivery window up to 60 days.  The full system (router and RF) may be considered part of the waveform aspects that are of value to NASA. Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on 02/27/2006. Documents related to this procurement are available over the Internet.  These documents reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.

<DESC>This is a sole source combined synopsis/solicitation for services prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  
This procurement is a subscription renewal for the information database currently used in the CDC Library.  This is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed actions based on responses to this notice is solely within its discretion.  CDC is procuring for our library a database service which provides source materials from publishers with created associated abstracts and indexes.  Minimum vendor qualifications include the ability to provide web-based database with compatibility, navigation ease and search capability interoperable with other CDC Library systems; archival access to Ovid Technologies, Inc., databases in accordance with the terms set out in the license agreement; the ability to run statistical reports upon demand (online) and generate regular usage statistics; the ability to easily set up and receive alerts; the CDC-Information Center requires use of full-text from these databases for Interlibrary Loan and Document Delivery Services in compliance with current copyright laws, including CONTU guidelines; and ability to access the ABI Inform Database, which provides access to business and economic information and scholarly journals that can be viewed in abstract or in full text.  Database should include HeritageQuest Online, Digital Sanborn Maps, Ethnic NewsWatch, eLibrary, Chadwyck-Healey, SIRS-brand products, Axiom Press and most importantly ABI/Inform Research Online Package.  This also serves as a notice of intent to award on a sole source basis (Ref: FAR 13.106-1(b), with Proquest Information and Learning Company on other than a full and open competitive basis because their archive includes more than 5.5 billion pages of information, spanning 500 years of scholarship, in formats that range from print to microform to digital.  Proquest provides access to information from periodicals, newspapers, out of print books, dissertations and scholarly collections in various formats.  Proquest is also the proprietary product vendor for the ABI/Inform Research online package.  By virtue, Proquest is uniquely qualified and capable of carrying out the requirements of the proposed purchase order.  This database service will provide value added information within the CDC Library to researchers and staff.  The quoter shall provide pricing for the ABI Inform Database which provides business and economic information which can be viewed in abstract or in full text format.

Interested vendors may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals within 10 days after the publication of this notice.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will be considered for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or make a sole source award to ABI/Inform Research.
 
A firm-fixed price contract will be awarded as a result of this solicitation.  For information regarding this solicitation contact Ivory Reid in writing via email at ireid@cdc.gov
