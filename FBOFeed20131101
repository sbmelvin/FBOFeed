<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. THIS RFI IS FOR PLANNING <br> PURPOSES, AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, REQUEST FOR <br> PROPOSAL, OR REQUEST FOR QUOTES. THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT REIMBURSE <br> RESPONDENTS FOR ANY COST ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUBMISSION OF <br> INFORMATION BEING REQUESTED OR REIMBURSE EXPENSES INCURRED TO THE <br> INTERESTED PARTIES FOR RESPONSES. <br> The U.S. Army Contracting Command Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG), Aberdeen Proving <br> Ground, MD 21005, is conducting this RFI to identify potential sources for the development of EW capabilities as described below on behalf of Program Executive Officer (PEO) Intelligence & Electronic Warfare & Surveillance (IEW&S), Program Manager (PM) Electronic Warfare (EW), PdM (CREW). <br>  <br> Description: <br> Requirements have been identified to provide continued system growth and conduct research,development, testing and evaluation (RDT &E) of new capabilities for enhanced force protection against emerging Remote Controlled Improvised Explosive Device (RCIED) threats. Currently, a RDT &E effortknown as Duke Technology Insertion (DTI) is being conducted with the Army Duke system under contract W15P7T-09-D-M615 with SRCTec Inc, 5801 East Taft Road, North Syracuse, NY. The Duke system provides force protection against RCIED threats for occupants in wheeled and tracked vehicle <br> platforms and within vicinity of fixed site positions. This RDT&E requirement is to continue threat and technique development to maintain relevancy and responsiveness to urgent needs as required. This effort is intended to also include integration of the Duke system with other electronic warfare systems (e.g, direction finding, HMS radios, JTRS, TACSAT 117G/F, etc.). <br> System threshold and objective level performance parameters are identified within a Capabilities Production Document (CPD). These parameters can be provided to interested industry parties at a classified level. It is desired that the initial tested capability meets objective level requirements within the CPD. The system, however, must meet threshold performance parameters and be ready for testing in 3 rd <br> Quarter of 2015. It is anticipated that DTI systems and the Duke system Technical Data Package (TDP)will be provided to the successful offeror upon award of a contract that could result from any future Request For Proposal (RFP) of the DTI effort. <br> The Government requests that interested parties submit white papers that fully describe their system capabilities with respect to the classified performance levels in as much detail as possible. Based on the white paper submission, the Government may elect to conduct a one-on-one discussion based on its analysis of the RFI response, to include the quality of submission and level and scope of the information <br> provided. This may include visit to contractor facilities to assess firsthand the validity of described capabilities and, if needed, its demonstration. Any capability and demonstration must be available for government assessment no later than 15 January 2014. <br> Those capabilities that show promise may be selected for additional testing at Government lab on Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD. Test results from closed loop or compatibility testing may be releasable to a variety of DoD activities. <br> NOTE THE GOVERNMENT IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO CONDUCT DISCUSSION OR <br> REQUEST DEMONSTRATION, NOR IS IT LIABLE FOR ANY COSTS OR EXPENSES <br> INCURRED IN RESPONDING TO THIS RFI. <br>  <br> Response Format: <br> Interested parties who believe they are capable of fulfilling this requirement are invited to submit a white paper fully describing their system capabilities. The paper must include company name, company address, overnight delivery address (if different from mailing address), cage code, point of contact, e-mail <br> address, telephone number, fax number; business size, unique qualifiers (e.g. large, foreign, small disadvantage, veteran owned, woman owned, etc.). <br> Interested parties are requested to respond to this RFI in Microsoft Word Office 2007 compatible format. <br> RFI responses are limited to 15 pages, including cover and administrative pages. Response documents shall be written using a 10 point font size or larger. <br> The Government acknowledges its obligation under 18 U.S.C. 1905 to protect information qualifying as confidential under this statute.

Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data with the restrictive legend (all caps)PROPRIETARY with any explanatory text, so that the Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected. <br>  <br> 2. In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly proprietary (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as proprietary may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response-see item 3 below). Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected. <br>  <br> 3. The Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data. Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the Government will not be protected once in the public domain. Data already in the possession of the Government will be protected in accordance with the Government's rights in the data. <br>  <br> 4. Proprietary data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the government, shall contain the proprietary legend, with any explanatory text,on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and the beginning ofthe file itself. Where appropriate for only portions of an electronic file, identify where the restrictive legends proprietary portion <br> begins and where the proprietary portion ends. <br>  <br> RESPONSE Deadline and Submissions: <br> Parties may begin submitting responses to this request for information immediately with all white paper submissions due no later than the response date of this RFI. <br> Requests for classified information shall be sent to:  <br>  <br> Willie Jackson at willie.c.jackson.civ@mail.mil <br>  <br> Further instructions, to include any submittal of classified information, and questions shall be sent via email to: Willie Jackson at willie.c.jackson.civ@mail.mil <br>  <br> White papers shall be sent to: Willie Jackson at willie.c.jackson .civ@mail.mil <br>  <br> The information provided in response to this RFI will be used to support on-going initiatives within DoD to analyze emerging requirements for mounted CREW systems and ultimately may result in the Government developing and issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) to industry for award of contract. <br>  <br> Contracting Office Address: <br> 6001 Combat Drive <br> APG, MD 21009 <br>  <br> 1.

<p dir="ltr" align="left">The proposed contract is a partial set-aside for small business concerns (50/50). The small business size standard is 500 employees. Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. The solicitation, attachments, and any subsequent amendments will be available at <a href="https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/RFP"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span>https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/RFP</span></span></a><span> on the issue date of 08/08/13. Specifications, plans or drawings are not available. Proposed procurement contains a 100% option for increased quantities. This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 ( c )(1). Approved sources are: Rolls-Royce (63005) and Pneudraulics, Inc. (06177). While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation. One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the United States by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979. All offers shall be in the English language and in U.S. dollars. All interested suppliers may submit an offer.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>

<DESC>NASA Kennedy Space Center (KSC) plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to compete requirements for Commercial Crew Transportation Capability (CCtCap) Phase 2 of the Commercial Crew Program. The CCtCap contract is the second phase of a two-phased procurement strategy to develop a U.S. commercial crew space transportation capability to achieve safe, reliable and cost effective access to and from the International Space Station (ISS) with a goal of no later than 2017. The Certification Products Contract (CPC), Phase 1 of the phased acquisition, has been awarded and began certification efforts for the purchase of early lifecycle certification data products related to an end-to-end Crew Transportation System (CTS) for an International Space Station (ISS) Design Reference Mission (DRM). Phase 1 contract deliverables included Alternate Standards, Hazard Reports, Verification and Validation Plan, and Certification Plan. Phase 2 will build on the results of Phase 1 and is to complete the design, development, test, evaluation, and certification of an integrated CTS capable of transporting NASA crew to and from the ISS. Phase 2 also includes post certification missions to the ISS (includes ground, launch, on-orbit, and return and recovery operations), and special studies services for risk reduction related to its CTS. The CCtCap award criteria for Phase 1 contractors will include demonstrated completion of Phase 1 requirements as defined in the RFP. The Government expects that only Phase 1 contractors will be capable of successfully competing for Phase 2. Notwithstanding the expectation that only Phase 1 contractors will be capable of successfully competing for Phase 2, all proposals will be considered.  Any other responsible source may indicate its desire to submit a proposal by responding to this synopsis and by obtaining the solicitation (once released) from the NASA Business Opportunities internet page shown below.	In order to contend for a Phase 2 award, however, such prospective offerors that where not awarded a phase 1 contract  must demonstrate an integrated design maturity and certification maturity equivalent to that of the Phase 1 contract (CPC) deliverable requirements. Failure to fully and completely demonstrate the appropriate level of design and certification maturity may render the proposal unacceptable with no further consideration for contract award. The contract type for CCtCap will be Firm Fixed Price. The CCtCap procurement is a full and open competition acquired using FAR part 15 with the goal for completion of the baseline work no later than 2017 and providing for issuance of IDIQ task orders within an ordering period not to exceed 5 years from the effective date of the contract. All responsible sources may submit an offer to the RFP which shall be considered by the agency. The CCtCap procurement will not be set-aside for small businesses and will require a small business subcontracting plan. A draft RFP has been released for CCtCap; issued under NNK14467515R DRAFT. The anticipated release date of the CCtCap RFP is on or about November 19, 2013, with an anticipated due date for proposals on or about January 22, 2014. After the release of the RFP, NASA/KSC plans to hold a pre-proposal conference on or about December 4, 2013. Details concerning the pre-proposal conference will be provided once the RFP is released. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.  The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html .  The NAICS Code and Size Standard are 336414 and 1,000 employees, respectively. The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet. The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA Business Opportunities page is http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=76 . It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any). Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any). Prospective offerors shall notify this office of their intent to submit an offer by November 8, 2013. This notification shall be sent via e-mail to the Contracting Officer at e-mail address listed below. A procurement specific website has also been established for CCtCap and can be accessed at: http://commercialcrew.nasa.gov/  (click the Certification-CCtCap tab). Prospective offerors are also invited to submit written comments or questions via electronic transmission to the Contracting Officer at the following e-mail address ksc-cp2@mail.nasa.gov.

<DESC>NASA/LARC has a requirement for PowerFLOW Software Licenses. NASA/LARC intends to purchase the items from Exa Corporation. The proprietary software is only available through EXA Corporation. No other software is compatible with the exisiting PowerFLOW datasets currently in use at NASA Langley. It would take substantial duplication of resources and time for another source to provide the software, and this additional response is not expected to be recovered through competition. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 12:30 p.m. local time on 11/05/2013. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html.

Please submit your request at least ten (10) calendar days before the scheduled closing date of the solicitation.   Request a decision as to the format acceptability and make sure you receive approval of the alternate format before using it to send your offer.

4.	The virus scanning software used by our e-mail systems cannot always distinguish a macro from a virus. Therefore, sending a macro embedded in an e-mail message or an e-mail attachment may cause the e-mail offer to be quarantined.   You may send both the spreadsheet and the spreadsheet saved in PDF format to ensure that your proposal is readable.

Password protecting your offer is not permitted.  The Contracting Officer will file the offer electronically which will allow access only by designated individuals.
Important Notice: Apparent successful offerors must apply for and receive verification from the Department of Veteran Affairs Center for Veterans Enterprise (CVE) in accordance with 38 CFR Part 74 and VAAR 819.70 by submission of documentation of Veteran status, ownership and control sufficient to establish appropriate status, offerors must be both VISIBLE and VERIFIED by the Department of Veteran Affairs Center for Veterans Enterprises at the time of submission of proposal.

In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose.

The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION. NO RESPONSE NECESSARY!! On or about November 15, 2013, the National Park Service (NPS), Midwest Regional Office - Major Acquisition Buying Office (MWRO - MABO), intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to award a single, firm-fixed price contract for the preparation of a National Historic Landmark nomination at James A. Garfield Home National Historic Landmark and National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) nomination at James A. Garfield National Historic Site (Mentor, Ohio). A new NHL nomination is required meeting todays professional standards and thematic framework along with a clearly defined boundary justification and map.  James A. Garfield Home NHL is within the larger boundaries of James A. Garfield National Historic Site, a unit of the National Park System authorized by Congress on December 28, 1980.  A second National Register of Historic Places nomination is also required to evaluate and document James A. Garfield National Historic Site.  This nomination should reflect scholarship in the Historic Resource Study (1984) and Historic Structure Reports (1990 and 1992) available online at http://www.nps.gov/history/history/parkhistories_NEW.htm#j as well as the List of Classified Structures (LCS) and Cultural Landscape Inventory (CLI) for the park. The proposal will include three components; a detailed research strategy, evidence of personnel qualifications, and cost. The government will review the progress of the report development through required drafts and provide comments as necessary. The NHL and NHS nominations shall be completed within eighteen (18) months of the date of the award.  Depending upon the availability of funds, one or both nominations shall be awarded (in such instance, the NHL nomination is the primary end product). The work will be accomplished in accordance with the contract and will consist of the components discussed in the statement of work and related addenda. THIS WILL NOT BE A SEALED BID OR LOW BID PROCUREMENT. A best value trade-off selection process will be conducted in accordance with FAR part 13. At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, portions of FAR parts 12 and 15 may be utilized. This best value approach will use factors such as technical, past performance and price. It is anticipated the aforementioned factors will be listed in descending order of importance and that all non-price related factors, when combined, will be significantly more important than cost/price. Failure to submit all requested information in the solicitation may result in the entire proposal being disqualified from further competition. The Government intends to award without discussions, but reserves the right to conduct discussion should it be deemed in the Government's best interest.

This part requires engineering source approval by the design control activity in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the
qualified source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s).
The approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical
data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures,
as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over the part in the intended application. The subject item requires Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source(s) previously approved by the Government for this item have been solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in one of the NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) Source Approval Information Brochures listed below. Spares: www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx Repair: www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx These brochures identify the technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the
same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. If your request
for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source approval. Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

<SUBJECT>SOURCES SOUGHT FOR ENGINEER PROCURE CONSTRUCT CONTRACT FOR A NATURAL GAS FIRED NEW GENERATION PROJECT FOR THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AUTHORITY
<SOLNBR>NOV2013CT-CC
<RESPDATE>111813
<CONTACT>Randy W. Meadows, Contract Manager, Phone 423-751-2429, Email rwmeadows@tva.gov
<DESC>November 1, 2013
<p>QUALIFICATION CERTIFICATION FOR ENGINEER PROCURE CONSTRUCT (EPC) CONTRACT FOR A NATURAL GAS FIRED NEW GENERATION PROJECT (TVA CT/CC Project)</p>
<p><br />In the near future, TVA may be issuing a solicitation document to request proposals from experienced firms for the award of an EPC contract for a Natural Gas Fired New Generation Project (the TVA CT/CC Project) on a firm, fixed price basis. In addition to the required primary proposal on a fixed price basis, the offeror may also submit an alternate proposal methodology for an optional commercial approach. The alternate proposal may address such alternate commercial terms where the offeror believes there is commercial benefit to TVA.</p>
<p>The detailed scope of work will be defined for the TVA CT/CC Project, and will be provided in the Request for Proposals (RFP) to all those prospective offerors that certify they meet the Mandatory Minimum Qualifications and submit detailed supporting documentation to substantiate meeting all mandatory minimum qualification requirements. Any solicitation for the TVA CT/CC project will be subject to TVA obtaining the appropriate internal project approvals, environmental reviews, etc., and TVA does not commit to award a contract under this solicitation or to pay any costs incurred in the development and submission of any subsequent proposal.</p>
<p>Description of the Scope of Work for the TVA CT/CC Project</p>
<p>The TVA CT/CC project will be either a 4xCT Simple Cycle plant or a 3X1 CC (duct fired) plant located in the Tennessee Valley area. For both possible scenarios, the CTs will be natural gas fired with the possibility of backup fuel oil and will additionally include bypass stacks with diverter dampers. For the Simple Cycle CT scenario, the CTs will be engineered and constructed to allow for future conversion to Combined Cycle operation at a later date by others. TVA will provide all of the CTs (GE frame 7FA Series 5) and the Generator Step Up Transformers, as well as a 450 MW steam turbine, if required for the CC scenario. The EPC contractor will be responsible for all of the engineering, procurement, construction, and startup for the project. EPC procurements to potentially include: HRSGs, condenser, cooling tower, boiler feed pumps, circ water pumps, DCS control system, high energy piping, electrical switchgear, generator breakers, natural gas conditioning equipment, etc. The requirement of this project is to have the plant operating and in-service by early to mid 2017, depending upon the final scope.</p>
<p>Kiewit Power Engineers Company (Kiewit) has previously developed a technical specification for TVA's use for simple cycle and combined cycle projects which TVA intends to use as the technical specification in the RFP for the selected project. Even though an organizational conflict of interest may arise therefrom, in order to encourage submissions from the most qualified firms TVA will not exclude Kiewit from a possible subsequent award of an EPC contract for the project should TVA decide to move forward therewith, provided that Kiewit agrees not to withhold information developed during the preparation of the specification from TVA or place any restriction on the ability of TVA to fully disclose such information to other prospective offerors for such follow-up work. Kiewit has also committed that none of its personnel, employees, agents or contractors that participated in the development of that specification will participate in any manner in the development of its proposal in connection with a TVA project that utilizes that specification.</p>
<p>An "organizational conflict of interest" is a situation in which because of other activities or relationships with others, an offeror/contractor is unable or potentially unable to render impartial advice or assistance to TVA, or its objectivity in performing contract work is or might be otherwise impaired, or it has an unfair competitive advantage.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, TVA reserves the right to take such steps as it deems appropriate to neutralize or mitigate organizational conflicts of interest on the part of offerors, contractors, subcontractors, or their affiliates. Kiewit will not participate in the review or evaluation of any proposals from offerors and was not involved in the development of the commercial specification.</p>
<p>Since the Simple Cycle CT scenario must be developed with a combined cycle project conversion in mind, TVA desires to select a firm with a history of successful EPC experience with combined cycle generation projects that are similar to the workscope described above and in the enclosure entitled Mandatory Minimum Qualification Certification. As stated above, in order to receive the RFP, TVA requires that all prospective respondents meet these requirements before being further considered. Accordingly, all prospective respondents must first certify compliance with the requirements contained on the Mandatory Minimum Qualification Certification and submit detailed supporting documentation to substantiate meeting all mandatory minimum qualification requirements. Only the firms which TVA confirms meet all of the mandatory minimum qualification requirements will receive a copy of the RFP and will be invited to attend a mandatory pre-proposal meeting. No challenges will be accepted to TVA's decision.</p>
<p>In order to be considered, I must receive the enclosed Certification signed by an official authorized to bind the organization and supporting information at the address shown below no later than 12 noon EST, November 18, 2013.</p>
<p>Tennessee Valley Authority<br />Randy W. Meadows<br />1101 Market Street, BR 5A<br />Chattanooga, TN 37401<br />Phone number: (423) 751-2429<br />FAX number: (423) 751-6357<br />E-mail: rwmeadows@tva.gov</p>
<p>Three (3) copies of the Mandatory Minimum Qualification Certification and detailed supporting documentation to substantiate meeting all mandatory minimum qualification requirements must be submitted in 3-ring notebooks as well as two (2) CDs of the Certification submittal for ease of information dissemination and review.</p>
<p>Electronic communications shall be in a form compatible with MicroSoft&reg; Office 2007.</p>

<CONTACT>Jennifer M. Knobeloch, Phone 6182207046, Email jennifer.knobeloch@ustranscom.mil
<DESC>JFAST is the primary tool utilized within the Joint Operation Planning and Execution System (JOPES).  JFAST is used to view, edit, and analyze transportation requirements; perform course of action (COA) analysis; and evaluate "what-if" scenarios and project delivery profiles of troops and equipment by air, land, and sea.  JFAST is used primarily during the planning phase of Operation Plan (OPLAN) development to determine transportation feasibility.  JFAST schedules military units from their installations to airports and seaports of debarkation within the theater of operations.  JFAST accepts Department of Defense (DOD) transportation movement data via the Global Command and Control System (GCCS) Joint Operation Planning and Execution System (JOPES) Time-Phased Force and Deployment Data (TPFDD).  These requirements are coupled with data from the Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan (JSCP) that provides planning data regarding airlift and sealift assets.  It then models the movement of these requirements using the identified assets and transportation infrastructure constraints to arrive at a predicted deployment profile.
<p>The JFAST requirement has 11 task areas: Contract Management, Requirements Management, Support for Design and Development, Software Maintenance, USTRANSCOM Site Support, Interoperability and Supportability, Security Engineering and Cyber Security Requirements, Support for Annual JFAST Contingency Plan Review, Configuration Management, Enhancements, and New Modernization Capability.  The majority of the first three periods of performance will involve web-enabling JFAST (modernizing) under the New Modernization Capability task area.  Once the modernization is completed in the second option period, only sustainment of JFAST is expected throughout the third and fourth option periods.</p>

<DESC>The US Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service in Pullman WA. Need to make repairs to our greenhouse and we are evaluating the use of SDVOSB sole procedures found in 15 USC 657F. The USDA ARS in Pullman WA. have 5 greenhouse cells and 2 exhaust fans for each cell. The 2 exhaust fans in each cell are controlled by one relay which causes an overheating problem with the exhaust fan system. The recommendation is to install individual relays for each fan motor. Assumes no new electrical load will be imposed on the WSU power grid. Assumes no asbestos containing materials will be disturbed.<br /><br />Scope of Work: <br />Provide engineering, design and install parts necessary to fix our greenhouse work to include: <br />&bull; Install new moisture resistant NEMA rated electrical cabinet and new relays on north wall of north greenhouse cell so that each of 10 fan motors can be switched with separate relay. <br />&bull; Evaluate Argus control system and adjust control program to address 10 fan relays separately.<br />&bull; Connect control wires from Argus control panel to new relay cabinet. <br />&bull; Install new electrical raceway and conductors from relay panel to 10 fan motors. <br />&bull; Start up and test new fan power/control arrangement for correct operation. <br />&bull; Excludes asbestos abatement. <br />. No other technical information is available for this project and interest firms will have to gather all necessary information by viewing site.
<p>Interested firms will be required to view the site and gather all needed information in order to prepare proposals for our evaluation. The USDA ARS plans to evaluate proposals based on the technical approach, past performance and price. We anticipate that only one SDVOSB firm is willing to view the site for development of a proposal. This is a small requirement and funding hasn't been secured as of 11-1-2013. Request RFQ's by contacting Fred Gifford by email at fred.gifford@ars.usda.gov if you wish to receive an RFQ after funds are secured.

System peripherals are Harris AN/PRC-152A and AN/PRC-117G radios, Rockwell-Collins DAGR, L-3 TacROVER-p, Raytheon Microlight, shoulder mounted, military grade GPS receiver, Vectronix PLRF-15C. Centralized power for the power/data solution will be from a single source provided by a commonly available BA-5590, BB-2590 or conformal battery, or available external source (AC/DC). The external source will operate the system and recharge internal batteries. The OCS vest solution should be MOLLE compatible and adaptable to an Eagle, CRYE or BAE RBAV vest. A secondary solution will include an assault pack (backpack) configuration. The OCS system should be lightweight, man packable and durable.
<p>3. The key requirements for this Sources Sought are as follows:</p>
<p>a. Computer processor power - Using Passmark 7.0 benchmark software, the system will have an PassMark Rating, not CPU Mark, of at least 750. The preferred score is at least 1000.<br /><br />b.

The weight of the system; display/computer, power &amp; data distribution system, and cables will not exceed ten pounds, not including the vest and system battery.</p>
<p>This list is not all inclusive. A detailed requirements document will be available with the release of a Draft Request for Proposal (RFP) or with Final RFP.</p>
<p>4. Interested parties can submit a capabilities package, which should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements and describe how the proposed systems can meet or exceed the above mentioned key requirements. Ensure responses are structured and clearly labeled in the same order as outlined in the above mentioned key requirements. Recent, relevant experience in all areas should be provided. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming should be provided.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;Interested parties&nbsp;responding to this announcement should indicate whether they are an other than small business, small business, small disadvantaged business (SDB), woman-owned small business (WOSB), economically disadvantaged women-owned small business (EDWOSB), 8(a)-certified business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB), veteran-owned small business (VOSB), or Historically Underutilized Business Zone small business (HUBZone). The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this action is 334220. All prospective contractors must register in the System for Award Management (SAM) database to be awarded a DoD contract.</p>
<p>6. This notice is part of government market research, a continuous process for obtaining the latest information on the "art of the possible" and associated material procurement and approach risks from industry with respect to their current and near-term abilities. The information collected may be used by the Government to explore future strategies and implementation for the BAO kit. The acquisition strategy has not yet been determined. Market research results will assist the Air Force in determining whether this requirement will be a full and open, a small business set aside, or a sole source acquisition. If it is determined to be a small business set-aside, FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting will apply. Therefore, small businesses that want to be considered for a small business set-aside should demonstrate how they could comply. Potential sources are encouraged to submit recommended small business utilization requirements as a percentage of total contract value for consideration, in the event the acquisition is not set-aside for small business.</p>
<p>7. Information received as a result of this request will be considered as sensitive and will be protected as such. Any company proprietary information contained in the response should be clearly marked as such, by paragraph, such that &lsquo;publicly-releasable' and &lsquo;proprietary' information are clearly distinguished. Any material that is not marked proprietary will be considered publicly-releasable. Any proprietary information received in response to this request will be properly protected from any unauthorized disclosure. The Government will not use proprietary information submitted from any one firm to establish the capability and requirements for any future systems acquisition, so as to not inadvertently restrict competition.</p>
<p>8. When submitting a response, please be aware that the Air Force workforce is supplemented by contracted support personnel. Any proprietary data submitted may be handled by contract support services personnel who have signed the same Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) as organic AF personnel.</p>
<p>9. Responses are limited to 8 pages and should include technical and descriptive text to provide sufficient detail. The submitted documentation becomes the property of the U.S. Government and will not be returned.</p>
<p>10. Broad industry participation for this Sources Sought is encouraged. U.S. and non-U.S. firms are permitted to respond to this OCS System Sources Sought. Responses to questions from interested parties will be promptly answered and posted on Fed Biz Ops (FBO), unless some release of proprietary information is involved or the answer addresses a question peculiar to a Company or that Company's response.

<DESC>This project focuses on the use of Hitachi Virtual Storage Platform (VSP) Frame and support located at the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Transaction Services in Dayton, OH and Tracy, CA. This requirement focuses on the use of Hitachi VSP to maintain the DLA enterprise Storage Area Network (SAN) solution. This provides greater support to the warfighter by ensuring that critical data is available 24x7, 365 days per year and provides the best value to the Government through data warehousing technology. <br /><br />This requirement is for a storage upgrade to existing equipment. (Please see the attachedd BOM for greater detail).&nbsp;Specifically this upgrade will include physical frame and capacity upgrades approximating 230TB (terabytes) of additional storage. This is not a stand-alone storage upgrade, but an addition to the current Hitachi Storage system. The new frame will integrate within the existing controllers on the current system and cannot be substituted for by another vendor. This upgrade requires homogeneous components to ensure interoperability with the current VSP Storage Area Network.<br /><br />The DLA Transaction Services designs, develops, and implements logistics solutions that improve customers' requisition processing and logistics management processes worldwide. The primary mission of the DLA Transaction Services is to receive, edit, and route logistics transactions for the Military Services and Federal Agencies, and provide value-added services for standard MILS transactions, such as network interoperability and logistics information services. The DLA Transaction Services is the facilitator by which the heterogeneous Service supply systems are made to function as a homogenous DoD supply system. The DLA Transaction Services receives over 9 billion DoD logistics transactions per year, and applies numerous DoD level and Service/Agency edits and validations against these transactions, and then routes the data to the appropriate destination. In addition, the DLA Transaction Services generates over 1.5 billion images of logistics transactions in support of Total Asset Visibility (TAV) requirements. The DLA Transaction Services provides interoperability between many unique Service supply systems. This is accomplished by translating, editing, and validating dissimilar, often non-standard, data formats, and then forwards the transformed data to the recipient in a format compatible with their system.
<p>In the continuing process to expand services for customers, DLA Transaction Services is operating a full-service EDI Telecommunications Hub and is maintaining and refining a Translation Engine for the any-to-any conversion of ANSI X12, MILS, and User-Defined Format (UDF) documents in any combination/direction. With this capability, DLA Transaction Services acts as an Electronic Business (EB) Gateway for the DoD and other Federal Civil Agencies, performing translation to/from formats specified by each of the customers. Essentially, the DLA Transaction Services is the facilitator that enables disparate systems to function homogenously.</p>
<p>Due to the essential mission that DLA Transaction Services provides, the Department of Defense has defined the operation as Mission Assurance Category (MAC) I, which identifies the DLA Transaction Services processing as vital to the operational readiness or mission effectiveness of deployed and contingency forces in terms of both content and timeliness. The consequences of loss of integrity or availability of a MAC I system are unacceptable and could include the immediate and sustained loss of mission effectiveness.<br /><br /><strong>This sources sought synopsis will not result in a contract award.</strong> A separate solicitation for quotations will be issued at a future date. All respondants to this synopsis will be notified of the solicitation for quotations for this action.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.   <br> 1. INTRODUCTION: The Government is issuing this RFI announcement for brownout sensor and system technologies that can be assessed at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 4 or greater.  <br>  <br> This announcement constitutes an official RFI as defined in FAR 15.201(e) and DOES NOT constitute a Request for Proposals (RFP) or commitment to issue a RFP in the future. The Government is not seeking proposals at this time and will NOT accept unsolicited proposals for this RFI. Respondents are advised the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in responding to this RFI. The costs for responding to this RFI shall be borne solely by the responding organization. Responses to this RFI notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract (see FAR 15.201(e)). The information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to pursue any course of action described herein. Follow-up questions may be asked of responders for clarification, but this will not indicate a selection or preference. <br>  <br> 2. PURPOSE: The purpose of this RFI is to update previously obtained information and to identify potential new technology solutions providing enhanced pilotage capabilities for safe rotorcraft operations in brownout flight conditions caused by sand and dust that can be encountered by rotorcraft during low altitude/airspeed flight. The Government is interested in receiving information on solutions that address airborne sensor(s), synthetic vision, and data/sensor fusion technologies associated with hazard/threat identification, depiction, deconfliction, flight path cueing, and guidance under brownout conditions. <br>  <br> 3. DVE DEFINITIONS: <br> 3.1 Pilotage: The system must emulate and display the external visual field. The imagery must be sufficient to conduct specific maneuvers demanded by the mission as well as all necessary flight maneuvers to the same level of precision as is done in Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC). The emulation of the visual environment must be accurate, intuitive, and include the ability to identify features (e.g., landmarks, terrain, obstructions, other aircraft, etc.), as well as other parameters sufficiently to be able to  quote mark see and avoid quote mark  those features while safely conducting landing, takeoff, limited hover/ground taxi flight maneuvers. <br>  <br> 3.2 Brownout Rotorcraft Enhancement System (BORES): The BORES is the integration of aircraft sensor(s) and pilotage information/cueing devices. The objective of a BORES is to expand the range of environments in which an aircraft can safely conduct intentional landing, takeoff, limited hover/ground taxi in zero-zero brownout conditions. <br>  <br> 3.3 Situational Awareness (SA): SA is knowledge and understanding of the current situation, which promotes timely, relevant, and accurate assessment of friendly, enemy, and other activities within the operational environment in order to facilitate decision-making.  <br>  <br> 3.4 Hazard Detection/Avoidance: Aircrews require the capability to detect and avoid, via visual, aural, or tactile means, impending collision with terrain, obstacles, or adjacent aircraft in a suitable amount of time that supports corrective or pre-emptive actions. <br>  <br> 4.

<DESC>The goal of this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is to reach out and discover efforts, methods, algorithms and applications that may be beyond the horizon of the Air Force SEEK EAGLE Office (AFSEO). The Science and Technology (S&amp;T) applicable to aircraft compatibility is a rapidly expanding field. A vast number of private companies, universities and individuals are contributing to the field of knowledge at unprecedented rates. It is an accepted reality in the field of compatibility analysis that traditional test-and-fix methods cannot succeed with modern systems. It is in the best interest of the Government to aggressively utilize S&amp;T advances to optimize the shrinking test dollars available to organizations.

This announcement is issued for planning purposes only and constitutes a request for exchange of information pursuant to FAR 15.201.  This purpose of exchanging information is to both improve the understanding of Government requirements and knowledge of industry capabilities.  Offerors are directed to NOT submit proposals at this time. <br>  <br> The Army Contracting Command - New Jersey (ACC-NJ), on behalf of Project Manager Soldier Weapons (PM SW), intends to award Multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts with Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Delivery Orders. The contract(s) will include four (4) ordering periods to cover FY14 - FY17 Army and Department of Defense (DoD) M205 Tripod requirements.  This requirement is 100% set aside for small business. The anticipated contract minimum is $2.6Million.  The anticipated contract maximum is 44,388 M205 Tripods.  The minimum contract requirements will be met when the first delivery order is issued.  As future needs for the M205 Tripod are identified during the four (4) years of the contract(s), future FFP Delivery Orders will be awarded through Competitive Best-Value contracting methods among the Offerors who have been awarded an IDIQ base. <br>  <br> The M205 Tripod is used with the M2/M2A1 Heavy Machine Gun and the MK19 Grenade Machine Gun and will be produced to a Government Technical Data Package (TDP).  The M205 Tripod is an improved ground mount which will replace the heavier and larger M3 Tripod for ground mounting the M2/M2A1 .50 Caliber Machine Gun and MK19 Grenade Machine Gun (GMG).  An integral Traverse and Elevation (T&E) Mechanism is included as part of the M205 Tripod and provides controlled manipulation in both T&E.  The M205 Tripod's primary mission is to provide a stable, easy-to-use, mounting platform for the M2/M2A1 and MK19 for delivering controlled, sustained, and accurate fire at extended ranges to support combat operations in offensive and defensive roles. <br>  <br> Any offeror(s) awarded a contract resulting from the formal solicitation shall be required to conduct First Article Test(s) (FAT) and a Lot Acceptance Test(s) (LAT).  A crucial aspect of FAT is a Live Fire Test requirement to be performed by the successful offeror(s).  The Live Fire Test requirement(s) will be solely performed by the contractor.  Awardees will be required to safely and securely store Government furnished machineguns, ammunition, and equipment in order to be considered for award. <br>  <br> Potential Offerors are invited to submit questions and/or comments to this DRAFT RFP, prior to the release of a final solicitation.  Offerors shall submit questions electronically no later than November 27, 2013, to Matthew Davis at matthew.w.davis.mil@mail.mil and Gherin Fracasso at gherin.fracasso.civ@mail.mil.  It is anticipated that questions submitted will be posted on Federal Business Opportunities (www.fbo.gov) along with corresponding answers. <br>  <br> Note:  No information exchanged with industry will be considered in the evaluation process.  The Request for Proposal will be the only time that an Offeror's information is evaluated for award.  Offerors are directed not to submit proposals at this time. <br>  <br> The Technical Data Package (TDP) for the M205 Tripod is categorized as Distribution B and is restricted. This TDP contains technical data whose export is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act (Title 22, U.S.C., Sec 2751, et seq.) or Export Administration Act of 1979 (Title 50, U.S.C., App 2401, et seq.), as amended.  Violations of these export laws are subject to severe criminal penalties.  This also applies to distribution of the TDP to all Subcontractors at every level.  Pursuant to an existing Negotiated License Agreement, the manufacture of the M205 Tripod is restricted to within the United States and its Territories.  Only contractors who have a completed and signed AMSTA-AR Form 1350 Technical Data Request Questionnaire, and a U.S. Government Use and Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA), to be executed by an authorized representative of the respondent's firm, will be granted access to the technical data.  At the conclusion of the solicitation process, all respondents in receipt of data covered under the NDA will be required to complete the supplied Certificate of Destruction notifying the United States Government that all licensed data received in response to the solicitation have been destroyed. <br>  <br> This is a special notice only and is for planning purposes only.  THIS IS NOT A FINAL SOLICITATION AND DOES NOT OBLIGATE THE GOVERNMENT TO ISSUE A FINAL SOLICITATION. <br>  <br> The points of contact for this action are: <br>  <br> Gherin Fracasso, Contract Specialist, Email: gherin.fracasso.civ@mail.mil; and <br>  <br> Matthew Davis, Contract Specialist, Email: matthew.w.davis.mil@mail.mil. <br>  <br> NO TELEPHONE INQUIRIES WILL BE ACCEPTED. <br>  <br> The Government will accept written questions by Email to gherin.fracasso.civ@mail.mil and matthew.w.davis.mil@mail.mil. <br>  <br> Contracting Office Address: <br>  <br> ACC - New Jersey, Building 9 Phipps RD, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000

<DESC>SYNOPSIS: <br>  <br> This Request For Information (RFI) is posted to conduct market research for capabilities from potential sources for development of an autoinjector drug-delivery device(s), or an already FDA-approved (cleared to market) drug delivery device that will deliver therapies useful against nerve agent poisoning. The particular therapies of interest are the nerve agent antidotes atropine and pralidoxime chloride, as well as the anticonvulsants midazolam and diazepam.  The Department of Defense (DoD) is seeking industry interest to manufacture these antidotes individually, in self-contained delivery devices designed for automatic self- or buddy-intramuscular administration by military Service Members.  <br>  <br> Respondents are invited to provide materials related to their capabilities to fulfill ALL or ANY of the requirements listed below. Respondents should provide whether their level of interest and current capability is to fulfill the entire scope of the effort, or a limited aspect of the effort, such as teaming as a subcontractor with another firm. If candidates are interested in teaming with other sources, please include in your response an authorization to release your company's name, area of interest, and POC information to be made available on a public website. All proprietary information should be identified as Company Proprietary. Do not use Government Security classification markings. <br>  <br> This is a Request for Information (RFI) for planning purposes only, as defined in FAR 15.201(e). This is not a solicitation for proposals. Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for the information solicited. No solicitation document exists or is guaranteed to be issued as a result of this RFI. Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted. <br>  <br>  <br> BACKGROUND: <br>  <br> Therapeutic pharmaceuticals against chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) warfare agents are required to support the Joint Forces across a range of military operations. As such, the DoD has a need for developing and fielding systems that provide treatment for exposure to CBRN agents. The Medical Countermeasure Systems-Chemical Defense Pharmaceuticals (MCS-CDP) Joint Product Management Office is responsible for the development, procurement, fielding, and sustaining of medical treatment and prophylactic capabilities against chemical, radiological and nuclear threats. The current MCS-CDP portfolio includes nerve agent therapeutics, pretreatments and prophylactics at varying stages of clinical development, including FDA-approved drugs. The DoD currently procures the following therapies for nerve agent poisonings through the Directorate of Medical Materiel, Defense Logistics Agency Troop Support:   <br>  <br>  	Diazepam, as a component of the Convulsant Antidote for Nerve Agents (CANA). Each autoinjector contains 10 mg of diazepam in 2.0 mL. Each mL contains 5 mg diazepam compounded with 40% propylene glycol, 10% ethyl alcohol, 5% sodium benzoate and benzoic acid as buffers, and 1.5% benzyl alcohol as preservative. The CANA is a self-contained unit for diazepam injection. The U.S. Army Office of The Surgeon General (OTSG) sponsors the CANA New Drug Application (NDA), NDA 20-124, approved in December 1990. The National Stock Number for the CANA product is NSN 6505-01-274-0951. <br>  <br>  	Atropine sulfate for injection, as a component of the AtroPen . Each 2 mg atropine autoinjector dispenses 1.67 mg atropine base (equivalent to 2.0 mg atropine sulfate) in 0.7 mL sterile, pyrogen free solution containing glycerin, phenol, citrate buffer and Water for Injection. The pH range is 4.0-5.0. The National Stock Number for the AtroPen  is NSN 6505-00-926-9083 <br>  <br>  	Pralidoxime chloride or 2-PAM for injection. Each autoinjector contains 600 mg pralidoxime chloride in 2.0 mL of a sterile, pyrogen free solution containing 20 mg/mL benzyl alcohol, 11.26 mg/mL glycine in Water for Injection, USP. The pH is adjusted with hydrochloric acid. The pH range is 2.0-3.0. The pralidoxime chloride autoinjector is a self-contained unit designed for self- or buddy-administration by military personnel. The National Stock Number for the product is NSN 6505-01-125-3248. <br>  <br>  	Atropine and 2-pralidoxime in a dual chamber autoinjector, as components of the Antidote Treatment, nerve Agent Autoinjector (ATNAA). Each ATNAA autoinjector contains 2.1 mg atropine in 0. 7 mL solution and 600 mg pralidoxime chloride in 2 mL solution in separate chambers as sterile, pyrogen free solutions for intramuscular injection, sequentially, through a single needle. The U.S. Army OTSG sponsors the ATNAA New Drug Application (NDA), NDA 21-175, approved in January 2002. The National Stock Number for the ATNAA product is NSN 6505-01-362-7427. <br>  <br> The DoD intends to procure the following therapy for nerve agent poisoning in the future:  <br>  <br>  	Midazolam, as part of the Advanced Anticonvulsant System (AAS). Each autoinjector should contain 10 mg midazolam in 2.0 mL sterile, pyrogen free solution for intramuscular injection, through a single needle. AAS is a self-contained unit designed for self- or buddy-administration by military personnel. AAS is currently in advanced development at MCS-CDP   <br>  <br> OBJECTIVE: <br>  <br> Currently, MCS-CDP is seeking capabilities from potential sources for development of an autoinjector drug-delivery device(s), or an already FDA-approved (cleared to market) drug delivery device that will deliver these nerve agent poisoning therapies. These life-saving antidotes and anticonvulsants are used in conjunction with the pretreatment, pyridostigmine bromide (PB).  <br>  <br> System requirements include individual drug delivery platform(s) containing diazepam, midazolam, atropine, or pralidoxime chloride in the doses currently procured by the DoD. The dual deliver of the drug components atropine plus 2-pralidoxime in an autoinjector is the subject of a separate RFI, Solicitation Number: W911QY-14-S-CDP1.  The Service Member-carried device must be administrable by personnel in Mission Oriented Protective Posture 4 (MOPP-4) over-garments and mask, to a casualty in MOPP-4. The delivery device platform(s) and drug must be stable at operationally relevant temperatures to include temperature extremes experienced by Service Members in the field.  <br>  <br> The desired storage conditions for each antidote in its drug delivery device is USP Controlled Room Temperature (i.e., stored at 25  C [77  F], excursions permitted to 15-30  C [59-86  F]; Keep from Freezing, Protect from light), or be such as to provide reduced logistical burden than the currently fielded antidotes. In addition, the shelf life should eventually achieve 5 years at controlled room temperature.  <br>  <br> As such, MCS-CDP is seeking information on current industry capabilities from interested entities in the following areas: <br>  <br> (1) Description of company's proposed drug delivery platform(s), to include: <br>  	General background information, product name and description, as well as pertinent development efforts needed to encompass delivery of a single drug (diazepam, midazolam, atropine, or pralidoxime chloride) in a single autoinjector. <br>  	Appropriateness of proposed drug delivery device(s)  for military field-use, including: <br> a.

<SUBJECT>34--RFI NATIONAL MAINTENANCE
<SOLNBR>D14PS00024
<CONTACT>
<DESC>DESCRIPTION
The Department of Interior (DOI) Acquisition Services Directorate (AQD) on behalf of the United States Coast Guard is seeking to obtain market research from vendors to assist the Government in understanding the capabilities available in the industry to provide support of scheduled preventive annual maintenance, spare parts support, and post-deployment inspection, repair, and refurbishment for the Coast Guard owned environmental emergency response equipment at various prepositioned equipment sites.  The caches of equipment support responses to oil spill and disaster relief incidents.  The Central Engineering Unit (CEU) Miami ATON/MER Product Line is responsible for national oversight of the equipment maintenance program and the implementation and management of a national integrated logistics system for prepositioned equipment. Additionally, the market research will assist the Government in determining how small business could fit into the United States Coast Guards acquisition strategy.
OBJECTIVES
The National Maintenance Contract (NMC) will cover scheduled Preventive Maintenance (PM), post-deployment refurbishment and unscheduled repair of equipment at all sites.  A comprehensive PM program plays an important role in the upkeep and timely repair of mission critical equipment.  Without adequate maintenance support, it is uncertain that the equipment will be consistently reliable for response deployment.
NOTICE:	This RFI is being issued solely for information and planning purposes.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.  This RFI does not commit the Government to a contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  Furthermore, the Government is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals.  Responders are advised that the Government will not reimburse for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested parties expense.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in a future RFP, if one is issued.
Sources Sought: This RFI is seeking responses from small businesses that can provide the required services under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 811310 Commercial and Industrial Machinery and Equipment (except Automotive and Electronic) Repair and Maintenance All Other Professional, Scientific and Technical Services, applies with a small business size standard of $7,000,000.
The data obtained from this RFI will assist the Government in understanding the capabilities available in the marketplace. In order to make a determination for a small business set-aside, two or more small businesses must submit responses that demonstrate their qualifications and their capability to fully satisfy the assessment criteria cited in this RFI.  Responses must demonstrate the companys ability to perform in accordance with the Limitations on Subcontracting Clause (FAR 52.219-14) which requires the small business to perform at least 50 percent of the work on the contract.
Responses should provide the business DUNS number and CAGE code and include a business size self-certification under NAICS code 811310.  Additionally, responses should include recent (within the past three years or work that is on-going) and relevant experience (work similar in type and scope) to include contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts, and points of contact with telephone numbers whether the responder performed the relevant work.  
Marketing brochures and/or generic company literature will not be considered.  Not addressing all the requested information may result in the Government determining the responder is not capable of performing the scope of work required.

Contractors shall allow five business days for I.H.S. processing of fingerprints taken electronically at an I.H.S. site and thirty business days for non-electronic processing of fingerprints using FBI Form FD-258. A list of I.H.S. sites with electronic fingerprint capability is available from the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>In addition, no Contractor or subcontractor employee shall be permitted to perform work under this contract if listed on the HHS Office of Inspector General List of Excluded Individuals/Entities (LEIE), http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov. As soon as practicable prior to the start of work, the performance of the work the Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer the names of all individuals to be used in performance of work for screening against the LEIE. During the performance, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer the names of any additional or substitute employees for screening before they begin work.</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for conducting security preclearance investigations in sufficient depth to ensure that each Contractor or subcontractor employee referred to I.H.S. is not on the LEIE and can obtain a favorable fingerprint clearance. Each security preclearance shall be conducted sufficiently in advance of the start of performance to avoid delays caused by denial of access. If this is a Time and Materials, Labor-Hour or Cost Reimbursement contract, the contractor shall not charge for or be reimbursed for labor hours or other costs incurred for employees who are unable to perform due to denial or access or the excess time required to resolve and clear unfavorable security clearance findings. If this is a Fixed Price contract, denial of access due to security clearance findings shall not be a basis for excusable delay or an increase to the contract amount.</p>
<p>Government will pay for the cost to process the contractor's suitability clearances. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, lead to reduction(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the extra investigation(s).</p>

A purchase order will be issued to the Contractor(s) whose conforming quotation in response to the RFQ will be most advantageous to the Government. Best value for this procurement will be obtained through a lowest price technically acceptable evaluation.

Section 508 Evaluation Factors- Responses to this solicitation will only be considered for receipt of the purchase order(s) after it has been determined that the quotation adequately addresses the requirements for Section 508. Only quotations which contain adequate information to document their responsiveness to the Section 508 requirements (e.g. a completed Government Product/Service Accessibility Template (GPAT) , VPAT or equivalent and supporting documentation) will be eligible for any additional merit consideration. In order to facilitate a comprehensive Government evaluation, contractors quoting "Or Equal" products are required to submit itemized technical specifications for CLIN 0001 on form Attachment 3. Additionally, contractors quoting "Or Equal" products are required to provide with their quote: 1) Documentation demonstrating the compatibility of the quoted "Or Equal" product(s) with NARA's network software as required by the Salient Characteristics. At a minimum this documentation must include: the date completed; name, position, and contact information of the person(s) conducting the verification; and methodology of configuring the "Or Equal" product to function with NARA's network; and 2) Documentation demonstrating that the quoted "Or Equal" product's capability to comply with the label printing requirement as required by the Salient Characteristics; this documentation must include: the date completed; name, position, and contact information of the person(s) conducting the testing; and results of the testing. The Government may contact the person to verify the performance results. This requirement is of utmost importance considering the potentially devastating production issues that would result from latently non-compatible items.

REQUIREMENTS: F.O.B. Destination pricing is requested for each CLIN, all delivery costs must be included in total firm fixed price. See Enclosure 1, Schedule of Prices.

Section 508 Program Need - Requirements for accessibility based on Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d) are determined to be relevant for the following program need: "Multifunction Machines." Section 508 Deliverable Requirements - Technical standards from 36 CFR part 1194 Subpart B have been determined to apply to this acquisition. Solicitation respondents must describe how their proposed Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) deliverables meet at least those technical provisions identified as applicable in Attachment 2, Government Product/Service Accessibility Template (GPAT). Functional performance criteria from 36 CFR part 1194 Subpart C have been determined to apply to this acquisition. Solicitation respondents must describe how their proposed Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) deliverables meet at least those functional performance criteria identified as applicable in Attachment 2. Information, documentation, and support requirements from 36 CFR part 1194 Subpart D have been determined to apply to this acquisition.

Section 508 Acceptance Criteria - Multifunction Machines delivered as a result of this solicitation will be accepted based in part on satisfaction of identified Section 508 requirements for accessibility. Multifunction Machines delivered must include a completed GPAT, a sample of which is included as a part of this solicitation. Contractors must complete and return RFQ Attachment 1, Required Quote Information. It is the Contractor's responsibility to ensure that NARA is not provided either counterfeit or grey market products. In the event that such IT products are determined to be counterfeit or grey market, NARA will seek all available legal remedies including criminal prosecution. Counterfeit information technology product means any item of information technology (IT), including hardware and software that is an unauthorized copy, replica, or substitute. A grey market or gray market also known as parallel market is the trade of a commodity through distribution channels which, while legal, are unofficial, unauthorized, or unintended by the original manufacturer . As a result manufacturers will not honor associated warranties and service agreements. Unless you, the Vendor, are authorized by the manufacturer to resell the particular items you are quoting in the USA, it is in your best interest as well as the Government's that you simply do not respond. NARA will verify with the manufacturers immediately upon order issuance that the Contractor is an authorized reseller for this buy. Any issues with the information provided by the manufacturer to the Government about the grey market status of the items must be addressed by the Contractor to the manufacturer. The Government will immediately cancel any order based on a quotation of grey market items. In an effort to further ensure NARA is receiving new, manufacturer approved OEM items and will receive the benefits of any warranties or other manufacturer guarantees, NARA requires contractors to submit with their quote proof in writing from the OEM manufacturer of their status as an authorized/certified OEM Contractor of the manufactured items. Contractors must complete and return Attachment 1, Required Quote Information, and Attachment 2, Government Product/Service Accessibility Template (GPAT), in order for their quotations to be considered. TAA COMPLIANCE: As this award is not expected to exceed the TAA compliance threshold, TAA compliance is not required. QUESTIONS: Questions regarding this RFQ must be submitted in writing to Mr. Kevin Schumacher no later than 4:00 PM ET on November 5, 2013 to be considered. Questions submitted in any other manner will not be answered. The Government will answer questions or requests for clarification via a written RFQ amendment. SUBMISSION OF QUOTATIONS: One (1) copy of each quotation should be mailed to National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), Attention: Mr. Kevin Schumacher NAMA-14-Q-0009, 1 Archives Drive, St. Louis, MO 63138 or e-mailed to: kevin.schumacher@nara.gov Quotations should be received by 4:00 PM ET on November 16, 2013. Failure to submit quotations by the due date may result in rejection of the quotation as untimely Contractors submitting via e-mail are cautioned to allow one extra business day for delivery and confirm receipt of quotation as the e-mail will need to pass through IT security. The following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses are incorporated and are to remain in full force in any resultant fixed price contract, with the exception of FAR provisions which will be removed prior to issuance of the order: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items (Jul 2013); FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (Aug 2013) - Offerors shall complete only paragraph (b) of this provision if the offeror has completed the annual representations and certificates electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov.

<p>1352.209-73, COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAWS (APRIL 2010) <br />The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>1352.209-74, ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (APRIL 2010)<br />(a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: <br />(1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and <br />(2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.<br />(b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as "contractor") in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.<br />(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <br />(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.<br />(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br />(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. <br />(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <br />(End of clause)</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

<p>&nbsp;<br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).</p>
<p>Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<DESC><strong>POC:</strong> Jennifer Van Renterghem, USTDA<br />1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600<br />Arlington, VA 22209-3901<br />Tel: (703) 875-4357<br />Fax: (703) 875-4009<br />Email: <a href="mailto:RFPQuestions@ustda.gov">RFPQuestions@ustda.gov</a>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Proposal Submission Place:<br /></span></strong>Directorate for Communication and Information Technology<br />(Directia pentru Comunicatii si Tehnologia Informatiei)<br />Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Government of Romania<br />Piata Revolutiei nr.1 A, sector 1<br />Bucharest, Romania<br />E-Mail: <a href="mailto:bogdan.tohaneanu@mai.gov.ro">bogdan.tohaneanu@mai.gov.ro</a> and <a href="mailto:grup.ustda@mai.gov.ro">grup.ustda@mai.gov.ro</a></p>
<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for data center modernization and consolidation for the Romanian Ministry of Internal Affairs.</p>
<p>Currently, the Ministry of Internal Affairs' (MAI) data gathering, use, storage, and management are constrained by a number of inefficiencies. Many of these inefficiencies result from limited operational budgets and staff, along with data centers and servers that are reaching the end of their useful lives and are operated autonomously by the MAI's central and subordinate units. The MAI believes that the current situation, characterized by a proliferation of independent and autonomous server locations and small data centers operated and/or accessed by 19 of the Ministry's central and support units is inefficient, unnecessarily costly, and difficult to manage. This situation puts data and electronic government (eGov) systems at great risk for loss of data and jeopardizes government operations.</p>
<p>In order to address these issues, the MAI is planning ICT infrastructure projects including a data center and systems consolidation initiative, government interoperability framework, and a "single window" for user access to the Grantee's data and services. As part of this project, the MAI is planning the consolidation of a large number of currently disparate data centers, and servers used by various agencies within the MAI into a consolidated and modernized facility, offering disaster management and continuity of operations. The MAI has a broad mandate from the Government of Romania to carry out the Data Center Modernization and Consolidation Project in order to realize the expected efficiencies and capabilities.</p>
<p>This Feasibility Study would help the MAI to assess the technical, economic, and financial feasibility of migration of existing independent data centers into a single consolidated data center. The single center would have space available for co-location and use by other organizations, which may be needed for disaster recovery or other requirements including implementing a government interoperability framework for data systems and application integration. The goal of the project is more effective delivery of services to government, business, and citizens while at the same time yielding substantial cost savings.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $400,600 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and portions of a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901. To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp">https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp</a> <br /><br />Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009. In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number. Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP. Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored. Please check your internal fax verification receipt. Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification. Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day. Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day. Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity. Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country. The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount. Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.</p>
<p>Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">12:00 PM local time, December 2, 2013</span></strong> at the above address. Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP. Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted. The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals. The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project. The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

Questions must be submitted by using the 'Submit a Question' feature at www.fedbid.com. Questions not received within a reasonable time prior to close of the solicitation may not be considered.*** <BR> <BR>For this solicitation, VHA NCO 07 - 534 - Charleston, SC intends to conduct an online competitive reverse auction to be facilitated by the third-party reverse auction provider, FedBid, Inc. FedBid has developed an online, anonymous, browser based application to conduct the reverse auction. A Seller may submit a series of pricing bids, which descend in price during the specified period of time for the aforementioned reverse auction. VHA NCO 07 - 534 - Charleston, SC is taking this action in an effort to improve both seller access and awareness of requests and the agency's ability to gather multiple, completed, real-time bids.All responsible Sellers that respond to this solicitation MUST submit the pricing portion of their bid using the online exchange located at www.FedBid.com. There is no cost to register, review procurement data or make a bid on www.FedBid.com.Sellers that are not currently registered to use www.FedBid.com should proceed to www.FedBid.com to complete their free registration. Sellers that require special considerations or assistance may contact the FedBid Helpdesk at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or via email at clientservices@fedbid.com. Sellers may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means. It is unacceptable to place bad faith bids, to use decoys in the www.FedBid.com process or to collude with the intent or effect of hampering the competitive www.FedBid.com process.Should Sellers require additional clarification, contact FedBid at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or clientservices@fedbid.com. <BR> <BR>Use of FedBid: Buyers and Sellers agree to conduct this transaction through FedBid in compliance with the FedBid Terms of Use. Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>In addition to any VHA buy terms entered in FedBid, the Seller (Bidder) has reviewed and acknowledges any attached solicitation documents, item details, delivery schedule, and/or instructions to Seller (collectively referred to as requirements), and agrees to all terms and conditions set forth in the solicitation documents. While additional support documentation (e.g. Seller Attachments) may be requested, pricing shall be entered as a 'bid' in the reverse auction - offline pricing is not an acceptable bid. At the conclusion of the reverse auction, if attached to the buy, the apparent winning bidder shall be required to complete the solicitation documents prior to award. <BR> <BR>This solicitation requires registration with the System for Award Management (SAM) prior to award, pursuant to applicable regulations and guidelines. Registration information can be found at www.sam.gov. <BR> <BR>Any questions and /or responses that materially change the solicitation will be incorporated in the resultant award document. <BR> <BR>If an "or equal" item is being offered, the offeror shall submit product literature at the time of quote submission in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with the salient characteristics requirements in the RFQ. Additionally, if the offeror is not the manufacturer of the quoted items, the offeror shall submit written evidence at the time of quote submission that clearly verifies that the firm is an authorized distributor and/or reseller of the quoted products and will provide the items on or before the delivery date. <BR> <BR>

<DESC><p><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistic Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought Notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Specimen Containers. This is not a request for quote or proposal. The MMESO Europe is the lead MMESO for this project.</strong></p>
<p>These Specimen Containers products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.</p>
<p>This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2 for Specimen Containers. All items proposed to be included in this QSL must be on DAPA for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. <strong>The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act Compliant Country (as defined by FAR 52.225-5), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to complete the DAPA TAA Certification. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Bill Woltjen at DLA Troop Support, William.woltjen@dla.mil, 215-737-7124.</strong> The QSL for Specimen Containers will be established approximately February 2014 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. Qualified vendors will be invited approximately March 2014 to submit pricing proposals to enter into an Incentive Agreement for Specimen Containers. The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Specimen Containers.</p>
<p>A. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Specimen Containers. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual volume in sales of $482,024.53. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Twenty product groupings were found to be relevant to the scope of this standardization action. Of the twenty product groups, four represent the clinically significant product groups for the QSL. Of those twenty, four items are considered the requirement for addition to the QSL and account for 85.58% ($412,538.68) of the total volume in sales ($482,024.53). The specifications for this project are shown in "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.</p>
<p>B. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must provide an e-mail response to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification to the lead MMESO POCs below. <br /></strong>The vendor's responses must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt; allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. <br />As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL", vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the date listed for closing in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the instant QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action. </strong></span></p>
<p>C. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection and coordinate logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The board is chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO Areas of Responsibility (AORs) and includes clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative.

<DESC><p><strong>The Defense Medical Materiel Program Office (DMMPO) Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistic Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought Notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Central Venous Catheters. This is not a request for quote or proposal. The MMESO Europe is the lead MMESO for this project.</strong></p>
<p>These Central Venous Catheters products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil</p>
<p>This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2 for Central Venous Catheters. All items proposed to be included in this QSL must be on DAPA for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. <strong>The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act Compliant Country (as defined by FAR 52.225-5), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to complete the DAPA TAA Certification. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Bill Woltjen at DLA Troop Support, William.woltjen@dla.mil, 215-737-7124.</strong> The QSL for Central Venous Catheters will be established approximately February 2014 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. Qualified vendors will be invited approximately March 2014 to submit pricing proposals to enter into an Incentive Agreement for Central Venous Catheters. The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Central Venous Catheters.</p>
<p>A. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Central Venous Catheters. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $1,036,176.66. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Eighty-five product groupings were found to be relevant to the scope of this standardization action. Of the eighty-five product groups, eighty-four represent the clinically significant product groups for the QSL. Of those eighty-four, six items are considered the requirements for addition to the QSL and account for 52.1% ($539,929.62) of the total volume in sales ($1,036,176.66). The specifications for this project are shown in "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.</p>
<p>B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must provide an e-mail response to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification to the lead MMESO POCs below. The vendor's responses must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt; allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. <br />As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL", vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <br /><strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the date listed for closing in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the instant QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action. </strong></p>
<p>C. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection and coordinate logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The board is chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO Areas of Responsibility (AORs) and includes clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to review responses and evaluate products for selection to the QSL IAW FAR 9.2.</p>
<p>Requirements to Qualify for QSL<br />Central Venous Catheters requirements are outlined below. Complete answers and all supporting documentation must be provided with the vendor's submittal by the response date stated in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification. A vendor who does not meet all of these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements as requested will not be qualified for the QSL.

Oral instructions or explanations given before the award of the contract resulting from this solicitation shall not be binding.</p>

<CONTACT>Margaret Zancanella, Contract Specialist, Phone 3036763451, Email margaret.zancanella@dha.mil
<DESC>The Department of Defense (DOD) Defense Health Agency (DHA), formerly TRICARE Management Activity (TMA), seeks information about the methods DHA may use to perform quality improvement activities for healthcare it provides both in its own medical treatment facilities (MTFs) and that it purchases in the private sector. To accomplish its goal of ensuring the provision of the highest quality healthcare possible for all Military Health System (MHS) beneficiaries, DHA intends to restructure how it administers its quality oversight program to obtain maximum impact and value to taxpayers. In particular, DHA seeks comments regarding which approaches it should consider to assess various aspects of clinical quality. DHA will consider approaches that the public identifies would best achieve the goals of the MHS's Clinical Quality Program. This RFI seeks comment from members of the public about how DHA can best assess clinical quality across both the Direct and Purchased Care Sectors. DHA will use the information received in response to this RFI for market research to develop its acquisition strategy and to achieve its program objectives for upcoming requirements for quality oversight functions. Specific program requirements and additional detailed information about the Program are below:
<p>TRICARE manuals are available at http://manuals.tricare.osd.mil/.</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong>: TRICARE is a DOD healthcare program which serves active duty and retired military personnel, other uniformed service personnel, and their dependents. DHA is accountable for the management and operation of the TRICARE program, which provides care to over 9.6 million beneficiaries worldwide in DOD MTFs and is augmented with private sector services obtained through Managed Care Support Contracts (MCSCs). The MHS maintains active and effective organizational structures and program activities to ensure quality in healthcare throughout the MHS. Clinical quality management activities include clinical performance measurement and improvement, credentials and clinical privileging, risk management, adverse actions, and patient safety. <br />DHA currently has two contracts in place to assist in performing oversight of the clinical quality of healthcare provided to beneficiaries in accordance with Title 32 Code of Federal Regulations Part 199.15 (32 CFR 199.15). The MHS Clinical Quality Management (CQM) Contract provides oversight of the clinical quality of care provided within the Direct Care System's MTFs; and the TRICARE Quality Monitoring Contract (TQMC) provides quality oversight of care provided in the Purchased Care System. <br /><br />DHA is considering consolidating these two contracts into a single contract, which would provide oversight of the clinical quality provided to beneficiaries in both the Direct and Purchased Care Systems. The contract will perform the following services:<br /><br />&bull;Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) Compliance Audits;<br />&bull;Joint Commission ORYX National Hospital Quality Measures Reporting,<br />&bull;External Reviews of Military Treatment Facility (MTF) Standard of Care (SOC) Cases.<br />&bull;Medical Necessity (Reconsideration) Reviews (Second Level Appeals),<br />&bull;Internal/External Case Reviews for Appeals and Hearings, and provide Clinical/Expert Witnesses for medical appeal administrative hearings and proceedings, <br />&bull;Assessment of Evolving Practices, Devices, Medicines, Treatments and Procedures, <br />&bull;Provide initial application/certification as a TRICARE- authorized RTC, PHP, and SUDRF proceeding and review for recertification, and<br />&bull;Focused Studies.</p>
<p><strong>The MHS CQM Contractor for the Direct Care System:<br /><br /></strong>The MHS CQM Contractor for the Direct Care System conducts studies (collect, measure, synthesize, analyze, report findings and formulate recommendations based on prevailing healthcare standard and evidence based practice) focused on evaluating and improving health care and reducing variation in the MHS. The work performed is comparable to the quality of studies presented in professional medical research literature. The MHS CQM Contractor proposes at least eight studies for consideration based on a thorough review and analysis of information gathered from DHA leadership, including the Services and the MCSCs; current trends in the healthcare industry with reference to the application to the MHS; and the findings of past MHS studies/outcome measures. <br /><br />The MHS CQM Contractor collects, displays, and reports clinical performance data on the MHS aligned with the strategic direction of the system and in support of the strategic plan. The clinical performance data utilized by the MHS are consistent with current national measures.</p>
<p><strong>Joint Commission ORYX&reg; Core Measures (Collection):<br /><br /></strong>The MHS CQM Contractor collects, displays and reports data on applicable approved Joint Commission ORYX&reg; core measures for all 55 DOD inpatient MTFs. Patient identification for data collection for each core measure continues for six months following end of the month discharges.</p>
<p>The MHS CQM Contractor reviews and reports on newly developed Joint Commission National Hospital Measure Sets to determine applicability to DOD MTFs, the volume of patient records meeting the specifications for the past year, and the proposed data collection process. In Fiscal Year 2012, 80,000 records were abstracted, of which 60,000 were performed to collect Joint Commission core measure data. Both paper copy and electronic health records were utilized.</p>
<p>MTF-specific patient level data created from these measures is available to authorized users and Service Quality Leaders. The secure web-based access includes drill down capability to the patient level and data analysis with display (i.e. statistical process control charts, bar graphs, line charts) on each participating MTF. The data are provided with national comparative benchmarks and MTF trends, and opportunities for improvement are identified. Best practices are noted and shared across the MHS. For measures in which any MTF is significantly below the national benchmark as identified in quarterly reports, the MHS CQM Contractor reviews the literature to identify best practices and provide the information to the Clinical Support Division (CSD), Service representatives, and the MTF(s). <br /><br />On a quarterly basis, the MHS CQM Contractor downloads, analyzes, displays and reports, as posted on the Hospital Compare website, National Hospital Quality Measure data from DOD, network, and Designated Provider (DP) network hospitals. The data includes comparable national benchmarks for average and top performing hospitals, along with trends noted and opportunities for improvement.</p>
<p>Facility-level data created from these measures are provided to DHA users and Service Quality Leaders. The MHS CQM Contractor posts the National Hospital Quality Measures work products on a secure web portal. This includes data analysis with display (i.e. statistical process control charts, bar graphs, line charts) stratified by Service, Contract Region, DP and MHS levels. Reports, presentations and a user's guide to support new users of the site are also included.<br /><br />The MHS CQM Contractor supports the MHS in maintaining compliance with the Joint Commission ORYX&reg; accreditation requirement. The MHS CQM Contractor has a certified Joint Commission ORYX&reg; vendor for Inpatient Joint Commission ORYX&reg; and is certified for DOD Information Technology Security Certification and Accreditation Process (DIACAP). Part of Joint Commission ORYX&reg; costs include submission of the previous quarter's data to ensure the data set is complete. The MHS CQM Contractor also has approved Non-Core Joint Commission ORYX&reg; measures in their measurement system for disease management of diabetes, asthma care and hypertension aligned with the measures historically used by the DOD. Administrative data and electronic data sources are used as much as possible and supplemented by medical record abstraction and/or survey data as required. <br /><br />The MHS CQM Contractor facilitates the MHS's transition to new core measure sets as appropriate. The MHS CQM Contractor plans and conducts a non-core measure pilot and submits the developed measure set to Joint Commission for approval. At the completion of the contract, all MTF data collected to meet the Joint Commission ORYX&reg; requirements will be transitioned per CSD's direction. <br /><br />The Contractor assumes responsibility for all tasks in the Performance Work Statement at the end of the 6-month transition-in period. This includes the Data Use Agreements (DUA), Authorization to Operate (ATO), and personnel clearances to access DOD data systems. The Contractor must obtain an ATO prior to accessing Government data systems and patient information.</p>
<p><strong>TQMC in the Purchased Care System</strong>: <br /><br />The TQMC provides DHA with an independent, impartial evaluation of the care provided to MHS beneficiaries in the Purchased Care System. As a part of TRICARE's Quality and Utilization Peer Review Organization Program, in accordance with 32 CFR 199.15, TQMC reviews care provided under the MCSCs and the Uniformed Services Family Health Plan (USFHP) DPs . The USFHP consists of six DP programs that care for about 111,000 beneficiaries. The six DP programs are Johns Hopkins, St Vincent, Martin's Point, Brighton Marine, Christus Health and Pacific Medical Centers.</p>
<p>The TQMC also reviews records from other TRICARE contractors such as the TRICARE Dual-Eligible Fiscal Intermediary Contract (TDEFIC), TRICARE Overseas Contract, and the TRICARE Pharmacy Contract (TPharm) on a limited basis.</p>
<p>The TQMC measures and reports on the quality of health care services and provides tools for making informed decisions; insight for targeting quality improvement activities; information that allows for external comparisons of health care services against civilian benchmarks, between regions and DP service areas, and against the Direct Care System; and information that promotes medical care that is consistent with clinical guidelines. It measures, evaluates, and identifies superior quality health care services and recommends means to transfer successes throughout the MHS. It performs mental health facility certifications, peer reviews for the DHA, reconsideration reviews, and Standard of Care determinations for Military Treatment Facility (MTF) malpractice cases.</p>
<p>The TQMC reviews medical, surgical, and mental health cases to determine the medical necessity and appropriateness of care of the services provided and to ensure the MCSCs and DPs are performing pre-authorizations and retrospective and prepayment reviews. The TQMC also identifies cases of inappropriate medical care, preventable admissions, care that is not a TRICARE benefit, and potential cases of fraud and abuse. <br /><br />The TQMC applies appropriate quality screens and medical judgment to identify quality issues. These quality reviews utilize both process and outcome measures that focus on deficiencies in the delivery of health care that result in an adverse effect on the patient and also identify superior healthcare services. Any quality issues that are identified are confirmed by a board certified, licensed physician, who is actively practicing in the clinical area being reviewed.</p>
<p>The TQMC analyzes patterns, trends and variations among the Health Service Regions to include an assessment of "best value health care," identification and recommendation of superior quality health care transfer, a means for decreasing medically unnecessary utilization of health care services, a means for reducing preventable admissions, and recommendations for focused studies and quality improvement projects from a health plan perspective. <br /><br />The TQMC conducts focused studies that allow DHA to understand critical risks quickly and design and test specific interventions to improve the quality of care. The studies selected are those with a potential to significantly impact beneficiary health, functional status, satisfaction, and utilization.</p>
<p>The TQMC conducts external reviews of paid malpractice claim cases in which the Military Service's preliminary determination is that the malpractice payment was not caused by failure of any practitioner to meet the standard of care. The TQMC also reviews selected cases involving injury to active duty soldiers, including those resulting in a payment of a disability and/or death benefit. When the case involves a physician, the case is reviewed by a licensed physician who is board-certified in the same clinical specialty as the physician who provided the care. Additionally, the physician reviewer has an active clinical practice in the same clinical area being reviewed. If the case involves a provider other than a physician, a reviewer who is similarly qualified conducts the review. When a case involves more than one specialty, a separate report is issued for each specialty. For all cases, the TQMC (1) summarizes the facts of the case, (2) discusses the allegations, (3) determines whether the standard of care at the time the care was provided was met for each involved provider, (4) provides the rationale for that finding (standard text, practice guidelines, any evidence-based medical citations from the literature relevant at the time of the incident, etc.), and (5) determines whether the care provided caused the patient's injury. In addition, if the case was identified as a system problem, the TQMC includes rationale for agreeing or disagreeing with the identified system issue.</p>
<p>The TQMC provides clinical/expert witnesses as needed for medical appeal administrative/trial attendance, discovery, and DHA appeal subject manner conference calls in support to the DHA Office of General Council (OGC), Appeals and Hearings.</p>
<p>The TQMC is responsible for determining whether Residential Treatment Centers (RTCs), Substance Use Disorder Rehabilitation Facilities (SUDRFs), and Psychiatric Partial Hospital Programs (PHPs) meet TRICARE requirements for authorized provider status in accordance with the provisions of 32 CFR 199.6 and the TRICARE Policy Manual, and certifies facilities or recommends decertification of facilities to the DHA.</p>
<p>The TQMC reviews the hierarchy of reliable evidence, as defined in 32 CFR 199.2, and recommends to the DHA devices, medical treatments, or procedures which the TQMC believes have moved from unproven to proven. The TQMC performs health care technology assessments, which include full in-depth assessments and short assessments on specific focused health care topics. Short assessments are those which require less time to complete due to the lower availability of literature to review. The assessments use published, refereed scientific literature and assess individual health care technologies, to include the full range of medical or surgical devices, services or procedures; behavioral health devices, services or procedures; dental health devices, services or procedures; or the use of pharmaceuticals for purposes other than that approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.</p>
<p>DHA furnishes the data contained in the MHS population health portal to the TQMC to validate through a Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) certified vendor. The TQMC reviews National Coverage Determinations from Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) to determine their applicability as potential benefits in the TRICARE program.</p>
<p><strong>RFI RESPONSE FORMAT</strong>: <br />DHA requests RFI responses in the form of a white paper in Microsoft Word (Times New Roman, 12-point font). Please submit responses in the following format:</p>
<p><strong>Section I.</strong> Company name, mailing address; and the name, phone number, fax number, and email of the designated point of contact.</p>
<p><strong>Section II.</strong> The name and contact information for the business or other organization whose views are represented in the paper if that contact information is different from that provided in Section I.</p>
<p><strong>Section III</strong> (NO MORE THAN 15 PAGES). Please provide responses to each of the questions listed below.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTIONS: <br /><br /></strong>Respondents should review the Background information above prior to answering the questions. Respondents are asked to draw their responses from objective, empirical, and actionable evidence and to cite this evidence within their responses. DHA is particularly interested in the findings of research in the areas of health services delivery, citizen services, public policy and/or the administration of complex policy programs, innovation diffusion, change management, community organization/mobilization, industrial engineering or manufacturing, operations research, and other disciplines that can inform the quality improvement of services delivered in health care systems or the promotion of health through community-based organizations. While some of the goals of the clinical quality oversight program are directed by statute, the overall goal of the program is to ensure the MHS delivers the highest quality care possible to its eligible beneficiaries. DHA may use responses in designing the future direction of the MHS Clinical Quality Program.</p>
<p>DHA asks that each respondent address each of the following questions as it pertains to utilizing a single contractor to provide program support for all quality oversight functions throughout the MHS:</p>
<p>1. Given the background information provided, what do you believe is the best approach to assessing the quality of care rendered in both the inpatient and outpatient settings for Direct and Purchased Care that would deliver maximum program value to beneficiaries? (Respondents are reminded that all requirements listed in 32 CFR 199.15 must be met.)</p>
<p>2. What advantages would the program expect to realize by adopting the approach you articulated in your response to Question 1?</p>
<p>3. How would utilization of the approach articulated in your response to Question 1 allow DHA to ensure it delivers the most impact to patients' safety and well-being?</p>
<p>4. What are some important factors for DHA to consider if it were to adopt your recommended approach (including any alternative approaches you suggest in your response) in organizing its quality oversight program in this way? What else should DHA think about as it makes its decision?<br /><br />The following questions are related to factors affecting acquisition planning and competition: <br /><br />Based on the Background information above:</p>
<p>5. DHA is considering combining the services described above into a single requirement.<br /><br />a. Are there any reasons the services should not be combined?</p>
<p>b. What economies of scale and other cost savings can DHA expect to achieve by consolidating?</p>
<p>c. What are some added costs that may result from combining the contracts?</p>
<p>d. If the two requirements are not consolidated, what are some other ways to organize these services that would save money?</p>
<p>6. Based on the DOD Implementation Directive for Better Buying Power, Obtaining Greater Efficiency and Productivity in Defense Spending, knowledge-based contracts should be limited to a total of 3 years to increase competition.</p>
<p>a. Based on your company's experience, what is the typical length (years) of this type of contract?</p>
<p>b. How would a 3-year limit on the length of the contract affect competition? What factors would promote competition for this type of service?</p>
<p>7.a. Considering solicitation characteristics such as contract type, options, multiple vs single award, performance incentives, what specific solicitation characteristics would encourage your organization to submit a bid proposal in response to a solicitation for these services? Why?<br /><br />b. What solicitation characteristics would discourage or prevent your organization from submitting a bid proposal?</p>
<p>8. a. What solicitation characteristics would attract small business participation?</p>
<p>b. What solicitation characteristics would discourage/prevent small business participation?</p>
<p>9. a. Would your organization provide most services in-house? If yes, which services would be performed in-house?</p>
<p>b. What services would your company be most likely to outsource? Why?<br /><br />10. a. How are these services typically priced? For example, which services are typically fixed price, which are typically cost reimbursed? For fixed price what is the unit of measure? For example hourly labor rates? Price per study? <br /><br />b. For cost-reimbursed contracts what are the major cost drivers? <br /><br />11. What are the major risk factors associated with these services? <br /><br />12. What are the biggest challenges and frustrations facing your industry? What is the cost impact of these challenges?<br /><br />13. What incentives are typical for these services?<br /><br />14. Are there benchmarks/standards or industry "best practices" that your company uses to assess the quality of the services provided? If yes, please describe them. <br /><br />15. DHA is considering the NAICS codes below for this requirement. Which does your company recommend and why? Is there a NAICS code not listed that is more suitable? Why?<br /><br />a. 541611, Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services (Medical office management consulting services or consultants)<br /><br />b. 813920, Professional Organizations (Peer review boards, professional standards review boards, professional standards review committees)<br /><br />c. Other:</p>
<p><strong>THIS IS AN RFI ONLY</strong>. This RFI is issued solely for market research. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal. Interested firms shall not send proposals in response to this Notice nor shall they contact any other individuals about this Notice or the requirement. Any information provided to DHA is strictly voluntary and given with no expectation of compensation and is clearly provided at no cost to the Government.

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Authority. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1313.106?2?70, insert the following provision: Evaluation Utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures (Date) All solicitations using simplified acquisition procedures in FAR Part 13 must include provision 1352.213?70, Evaluation Utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures, or similar language setting out evaluation criteria.The Government will issue an order resulting from this request for quotation to the responsible offeror whose quotation results in the best value to the Government, considering both price and non-price factors. <BR> <BR>Insert clause 1352.239?70, Software License Addendum, in all contracts when the primary purpose is to purchase new software licenses or renew existing licenses.

<DESC>Sources Sought Notice<br />This is a Sources Sought notice. This is not a request for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. It is a survey to identify potential sources. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is performing this market survey to determine if an adequate number of organizations are interested in and capable of implementing and managing a complex project aimed at providing innovative social and behavior change communications (SBCC) campaigns in collaboration with the Government of Zambia (GRZ). The focus of the next generation project will be the provision of measureable improvements in health seeking behaviors, using cutting-edge evidence based SBCC initiatives, in: HIV/AIDS, family planning, maternal child health, nutrition, voluntary male circumcision, and TB. <br />Purpose/Objective<br />The Communications Support for Health (CSH) project is USAID's flagship behavior change communications project in Zambia valued at US$ 43 million and is implemented over four and a half years (2009 - 2014). In collaboration with the GRZ, CSH activities focus on the strengthening of national health communications campaigns, materials, and activities in: HIV/AIDS, nutrition, malaria, family planning, and voluntary male circumcision. The projects behavior change communications activities reinforce cultural and social norms that promote health and seek to modify norms that can be harmful to health. The goal is to reduce risky behaviors, and increase demand for and use of health services. CSH supports other USAID/ Zambia assistance programs in behavior change communications for message consistency and efficiency at the district and community levels. The four objectives of the CSH project are to: strengthen national health communications campaigns, increase GRZ use of evidence based health communication approaches, strengthen local capacity to implement sustained IEC/BCC activities, and increase coordination of IEC/BCC activities between USAID projects. The CSH project contract is scheduled to end in December of 2014, and it is USAID's intention to award the SBCC Innovations contract prior to this date.<br />Project Requirements<br />There are two main areas for the SBCC Innovations program:<br />1. Provision of evidence-based and innovative SBCC interventions includes.<br />&#61607; Applying innovations, and proven practices from commercial marketing, entertainment media, and other creative disciplines to SBCC initiatives<br />&#61607; Improving the coordination and bi-directional exchange between mass media, community-level activities, and inter-personal communications (IPC)<br />&#61607; Achieving adequate coverage of SBCC interventions among priority audiences<br />&#61607; Establishing and maintaining mechanisms for reinforcement and feedback between the project's national-level SBCC interventions, community-level activities, and IPC managed by the GRZ and other local partners. <br />&#61607; Developing, multi-channel SBCC interventions that have a measureable impact in improving health-seeking behaviors.<br />2. Effective research and measurement of impact include:<br />&#61607; Increasing the documentation of the contribution of health communication activities to adoption of improved health behaviors, including utilization of health services<br />&#61607; Conducting primary and/or secondary research activities to inform program design
<p>Anticipated Period and Place of Performance<br />The anticipated period of performance is for five years (2014-2019) for a total estimated amount of $US23 Million to $US 25 million subject to funds availability. The project will be implemented in Zambia.<br />Submission Guidelines<br />Interested organizations should submit a statement addressing the following points:<br />1. Capacity of your organization to perform the work described above<br />2. Past experience implementing similar project activities <br />3. Sample of challenges encountered and creative solutions employed to overcome those challenges when implementing similar projects<br />4. Organizational experience in attributing SBCC initiatives to direct impact in improved behavior change<br />5. Capacity of your organization to collaborate closely and effectively with other USAID implementing partners with SBCC project components <br />6. Description of past clients (governmental, non-governmental)<br />Statements sent in response to this Sources Sought notice should not exceed four (4) single- sided pages (including attachments and charts) using an 11-point font size minimum.<br />Send the statements electronically in Microsoft Word or Adobe Portable Document Format (pdf) by Thursday, November 13, 2013 at 17:00 local Zambia time to:<br />John Loongo<br />Acquisition and Assistance Specialist<br />USAID/Zambia<br />oaa-solicit-lusaka@usaid.gov</p>

<DESC>**Amendment 0005 to this presolicitation notice is to update the estimated release date for the solicitation. There is no response required for this presolicitation notice and questions will not be accepted at this time either by telephone or e-mail.     <br>      <br>      <br>    This synopsis is not a request for quotes or proposals. This is a pre-solicitation notice that a solicitation has been scheduled to be released via FedBizOpps (www.fbo.gov) to the vendor community on or about December 18, 2013 which will be available for 45 days. Specifications of this requirement shall be provided in the solicitation under Solicitation Number W81XWH-13-R-0038.       <br>            <br>    This presolicitation notice follows a Request for Information which was released as RFI Number RFIPRODDEVP on January 11, 2013.       <br>            <br>     The solicitation will be unrestricted and will allow for full and open competition.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541712 and the size standard is 500 employees.       <br>            <br>    Requirement Description:      <br>            <br>    This requirement is for all medical product development services required to support the U.S. Army Medical Materiel Development Activity (USAMMDA), the U.S. Army Medical Materiel Agency (USAMMA), other U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) subordinate commands, and Joint Project Manager (JPM) Medical Countermeasure Systems (MCS) (formerly Chemical Biological Medical Systems (CBMS)) in their missions to develop and manage medical materiel to protect and sustain the Warfighter on point for the Nation.  This acquisition will provide multiple awards of Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for services to support their missions.  Support services include support in the following areas, intended to support all aspects of product development: Technical/Administrative, Meeting and Informational Products, Clinical Development, Non-Clinical Development, Medical Product Manufacturing, Regulatory, Training, Protocol, and Information Technology.  This is a new requirement integrating and standardizing a multitude of different requirements into a comprehensive, efficient and economical approach to providing contract support for medical advanced development. This contract vehicle may be used by other activities of the Defense Health Agency when/if the USAMRMC is incorporated thereunder.      <br>            <br>    Background:      <br>            <br>    The USAMMDA and USAMMA, both subordinate commands of USAMRMC, are the Department of Defense's (DoD) advanced development organizations for medical products designed to protect and preserve the lives of Service Members.  The USAMMDA and USAMMA develop new drugs, vaccines, devices and medical support equipment that enhance readiness, ensure the provision of the highest quality medical and preventative care to the DoD, and maximize survival of medical casualties on the battlefield.  The USAMMDA and USAMMA direct, control, manage, and focus the development of medical materiel systems to meet Service-unique and joint Service performance, schedule, and cost requirements.        <br>            <br>    The USAMMDA and USAMMA Project Managers develop and field medical products for the US Armed Forces in conjunction with the Army Medical Department Center and School (the combat developer) and other service inputs (external partners).  Project Manager assigns product development to individual product managers and the product managers (PdMs), with support from the Division of Regulated Activities and Compliance (DRAC) and Clinical Support Services Division (CSSD), take promising new concepts and technologies developed in the USAMRMC laboratories and in the academic and commercial sectors, manage the development and testing of prototypes of these products (as necessary), and manage the products through the development lifecycle, ultimately to achieve US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, licensure and /or clearance, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) registration, and/or approval of the developed product, to include post marketing commitments, for use by our Service Members through the requirements defined in the DoD and Army acquisitions processes (DoD 5000 series).  Thus, the USAMMDA and USAMMA product managers are responsible for the success (including cost/schedule/ performance) of the product development effort and must manage Integrated Product Teams (IPTs) through the development and implementation of development plans (and other acquisition requirements, as applicable), to develop and field medical materiel.  The USAMMDA and USAMMA accomplish their respective missions by exercising four core capabilities:  (1) Defense Acquisition and Program Management; (2) Regulatory Affairs (FDA or EPA regulated products); (3) Medical Product Development; and, (4) Coordination of The Surgeon General's Executive Agent management of Force Health Protection's IND products.      <br>            <br>    Depending on the product development strategy, the Office of the Surgeon General (OTSG), Department of the Army, may be the regulatory sponsor.  For these product development efforts, DRAC and CSSD are the regulatory elements responsible for ensuring compliance with applicable regulations.  In these cases, DRAC and CSSD may execute FDA regulated sponsor responsibilities or delegate some or all of these responsibilities to the Prime or its subcontractor and only provide oversight of these activities. In other cases, the product development effort will include industry or academia partners who hold the regulatory Sponsorship, which may also include foreign government marketing strategies.  The DRAC and CSSD may provide oversight of regulated activities sponsored by partners, depending on the capabilities or requests of the partner.  Specific requirements will be variable and included in detail at the task order level.      <br>            <br>    Additionally, DRAC and CSSD provide regulatory affairs and medical product development support for other organizations outside of USAMMDA and USAMMA, including USAMRMC subordinate commands, and the Chemical and Biological Defense Program.  These organizations may utilize this contract vehicle to conduct product development activities, which are being sponsored by OTSG and supported by USAMMDA DRAC and CSSD.      <br>            <br>    The CBMS Joint Project Management Office is responsible for research, development, acquisition, fielding, and life cycle management of FDA-approved medical systems for protection, treatment, and diagnostic capabilities against chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) threat agents.  All CBRN medical countermeasures are approved by and regulated through the FDA.  The CBMS continues to aggressively explore opportunities to partner with other government agencies, industry, academia, and allied countries for all CBRN medical countermeasure efforts.  The CBMS product portfolio includes products spanning the entire acquisition life cycle.        <br>          <br>    Objective:      <br>            <br>    The objective of this requirement is to facilitate the timely and efficient execution of the US Army's medical materiel development program by providing a mechanism for all aspects of medical product/device development and life cycle support, including project management, technical expertise/assistance, strategic planning, market analysis, training, administrative activities, and pharmaceutical manufacturing and testing, assay validation, validated storage and shipment, non-clinical testing, clinical research (to include monitoring, safety pharmacovigilance and surveillance, full data management, and biostatistical support), regulatory writing and submission support, regulatory strategy and consultation, quality, integrated logistics support, equipment maintenance support and information technology in support of each task order.  For example:  a task order may specify that a contractor will conduct clinical trials worldwide (inclusive of pre-trial activities, trial activities and post trial activities),  provide product managers with support services to assist/provide technical guidance and provide independent and objective reviews, site feasibility assessments, prepare and assemble both generic and product-specific US FDA and EPA related documentation, take meeting minutes, provide complete clinical monitoring support including compilation of Sponsor trial master files, provide a data management system , preferably an electronic data capture (EDC) system, compliant with FDA/ICH regulations and guidance, data management, biostatistical evaluation and data analysis, safety pharmacovigilance and surveillance, and complete a final clinical study report compliant with International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) and/or FDA regulations and guidance.       <br>            <br>    Period of Performance:       <br>            <br>    The Period of Performance for this contract will be a five year base period with five one-year option periods.       <br>            <br>    Response:       <br>            <br>    This notice is for informational purposes only.  No response is required for this presolicitation notice.  Telephone requests in response to this presolicitation notice will not be honored.  Additional information is not available at this time.  Potential offerors are directed to respond to the Solicitation when it is released on this website under Solicitation Number W81XWH-13-R-0038.       <br>

Street, Detroit, MI 48201) currently has a contract that provides the labor, materials, transportation, equipment and supervision, in compliance with federal, state, and local regulations to provide Custom Sterile Surgical Packs. Custom packs are made up of individually selected components and are specific to each facility where they are used.  The packs are assembled by a manufacturer, sterilized, and shipped to the John D. Dingell VA Medical Center, 4646 John R. Street, Detroit, MI 48201 for storage.  The estimated value of this requirement is $  335,000.00.             


4. Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  
The justification rational is based on FAR 6.302-2 Unusual and Compelling Urgency.  It is clinically imperative that the use of the Custom Sterile Surgical Packs continue in the interim until new VISN or Central Region contracts can be awarded.  Medical centers employ the use of the Custom Sterile Surgical Packs in routine and emergency surgeries on a daily basis. Custom Sterile Surgical Packs are critical to patient care and unanticipated undersupply situation if the same number of Custom Sterile Surgical Packs become unavailable due any delay or lapse in availability of Custom Sterile Surgical Packs pending the award of new contracts.  

5. Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority
Due to the time required to adjust to a different manufacture there are several compelling reasons to sole source to Avid Custom Sterile Surgical Packs until new VISN or Central Region Contracts can be awarded.  These reasons included:  Changing pack manufacturers, components, or distributors takes several months to implement.   Avid is the only vendor which has the ability to distribute any of the several manufacturers currently in use in the John D. Dingell VA Medical Center, Detroit, MI  48201).  

Failure to establish a contract will require individual orders for custom packs to be awarded through contracting activity, which will not allow for just in time delivery.  Space concerns and current VA inventory metrics do not allow for overstocking of packs.  Packs are generally bulky and Logistics must keep no more than 2-4 weeks of stock on hand to meet performance measures.  The process from assembly to VAMC delivery takes 6-8 weeks.  Failure to procure packs on a timely basis can affect scheduled surgeries, resulting in delayed or cancelled cases and a decrease in the quality of care.  The statement of work requires the contractor to validate the sterilization process through the Association for Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) must validate the sterilization process.  Without adequate transition period to switch to a different Custom Surgical Packs manufacture this is risk that this validation could not occur in time.  Improperly processed Custom Surgical Packs can cause delays and under certain circumstances cause serious complications in an essential aspect of the VA's mission of providing healthcare to our nation's veterans.  

6. Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  
 The Contracting Officer will ensure posting requirements to Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) are followed IAW FAR Part 6.302-1.  As this is an urgent and compelling need, in order to maintain patient services in VHA medical facilities, competition amongst more than one source has been deemed impracticable by the Contracting Officer based on the considerations set out above. However, the longer term contract will be issued open market that will allow for competition to fulfill the Department of Veterans Affairs long term needs. This justification relates solely to the need of providing a bridge contract for this urgently needed requirement pending the award of the long term contract. 

7. Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  
Currently, the contract pricing has been established fair and reasonable per FAR 8.404(d) and will be used as a benchmark for renegotiated pricing.   


8. Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  

Market research was conducted concerning Custom Surgical Packs industry and it was discovered there are other providers currently in the market place.  However, for the reasons stated above the urgent and compelling nature of this procurement dictates that undue delays of potentially going with one of the other manufactures overrides the possibility of competing amongst all for this limited duration sole source contract.   

9. Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  
NA

10. Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  
NA

11. A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  
IAW FAR 6.302-2 (d)(i)(B) the period of performance will not exceed the time necessary for the agency to enter into another contract for the required goods through the use of competitive procedures. To remove any barriers to competition in the future, prior to making subsequent acquisitions for Custom Surgical Packs competition will be sought. 


12. Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.  
(This signature is the requestor's supervisor, fund control point official, chief of service, someone with responsibility and accountability)

<DESC>In accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, GSA intends to award the following task.
<p>GSA seeks capability statements from vendors who can perform the following task.</p>
<p>DRAFT Statement of Work</p>
<p>Background<br />Webster School, a 27,000 square foot former public school at 940 H Street, NW, Washington, DC, was purchased by GSA on behalf of the US Secret Service (USSS) in 2002. It was acquired to provide a security buffer for the then new USSS HQ next door. At the time GSA acquired the building, USSS signed a Memorandum of Understanding with GSA indicating that USSS would seek funding for the rehabilitation of the building for future use, but only limited funding for maintenance has materialized.</p>
<p>Since acquiring the building, using USSS funds, GSA has stabilized the structure, thereby saving it from collapse, installed a new roof, and mothballed it. During this period, it was determined to be eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places, and the DC Historic Preservation Review Board designated it a local historic landmark.</p>
<p>Since becoming part of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), USSS has asked only once for funding to restore the site and reuse it. They were turned down. GSA charges them a nominal rent of approximately $47,000 per annum, and building operating costs amount to no more than $18,000 per annum.</p>
<p>Project Objectives<br />1GSA seeks a comprehensive written report that evaluates the disposition potential for the Webster School.<br />Services required will fall under the following categories for the Webster School:</p>
<p>-Market Potential<br />-Development Strategies <br />-Land Use Planning &amp; Design <br />-Strategy Implementation</p>
<p>These objectives must be accomplished while complying with GSA's "Good Neighbor" policy (http://www.gsa.gov/graphics/pbs/gn_policy.pdf), which requires GSA to conform to local planning and zoning goals, including Floor Area Ratio (FAR) and height limitations.</p>
<p>Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are hereby afforded the opportunity to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written capabilities statement and pricing information in the format they choose. Please forward product and pricing information, referencing the announcement number, to email <br />adam.carlson@gsa.gov .</p>
<p>All vendors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) at www.sam.gov , prior to an award of a federal contract.</p>
<p>This is not a Request for Proposals; however, the Government will review any/all product, capabilities, and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>This justification relies on the exception to fair opportunity set forth in FAR 16.505. (b)(2)(i)(C) which provides for an exception when the order must be issued on a sole-source basis in the interest of economy and efficiency because it is a logical follow-on to an order already issued under the contract, provided that all the awardees were given fair opportunity to be considered for the original order. This justification permitted a modification to the Wolrd Learning Inc. task order to increase the number of students trained in the scope of work, increase the total estimated cost and extended the task order performance period by one year. All the awardees under the IDIQ contract were given fair opportunity to be considered for the original task order.
