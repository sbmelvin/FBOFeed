<DESC>Embassy of the United States of America <br />Solicitation for Media Services
<p>The Embassy of the United States of America welcomes the submission of proposals for the Creation of Press Kit for PEPFAR Mozambique Program</p>
<p>In preparation for the 10th Anniversary of The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, also known as PEPFAR, and World AIDS Day, the PEPFAR Coordination Office in Maputo, Mozambique, is seeking to outsource the creation of a PEPFAR Mozambique Press Kit.</p>
<p>Within the Press Kit, these 4 elements must be included:</p>
<p>10 Years of PEPFAR Media Kit: Produce a media kit with fact sheet, talking points, example speech to communicate 10 years of PEPFAR in Mozambique.  Language should be centered around the new Public Affairs Office media training model that identifies the key messages, supporting messages and proof-points.  The document should help create uniform aspirational messages about HIV that help rebrand it as a manageable, chronic illness, for those willing to seek, and adhere to treatment. &nbsp;<br /> <br />PEPFAR Health Topic Media Guides: Create a template and content for a two-page media guide for 5 health topics (e.g. Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision (VMMC), Preventing Mother-to-Child HIV Transmission, Treatment Adherence, HIV Testing, Community Adherence Support Groups).  The guides should provide brief PEPFAR program background outlining United States Government support/impact/location, key general public awareness messages, demand creation/call to action messages, and any messaging/cultural sensitivities.  The purpose is to have pre-approved content that could be replicated in press releases, and used in speeches, when one of the related health topics is being addressed. <br /> <br />PEPFAR Media Score-Card: Create a single excel resource document that all PEPFAR communication specialists can turn to for simple, accurate numbers to communicate the breadth and impact of PEFPAR.  The tracker should explain which SAPR and APR indicators were combined to calculate each number so that the tracker can easily be updated every 6 months. But it should also include very simple, public language describing each number so that the data can easily be used for public mediums.   The scorecard should show each key data point by province and the national total. One tab should be devoted to OGAC indicators (E.g., number of health sites offering Antiretroviral Therapy, number of people on treatment, number of people tested, number of mothers on treatment, number of VMMC, and another tab that summarizes PEPFAR's total financial contribution by province. <br /> <br />SEROPOSITIVO (People Living with HIV) Media Kit: Create a media kit that PEPFAR agencies and partners can use to promote the SEROPOSITIVO campaign and that provides examples of stats and messages that can be integrated across communication channels. This should include a campaign boiler-plate summary, example speech, speech talking point examples, media Q&amp;A sheet, and logo/branding guidelines for the use of the SEROPOSITIVO logo.  <br /> <br />Requirements and Desired Qualifications:  Candidates with strong technical and creative writing skills are desired, as graphics and data must align with content. Candidates should have knowledge of PEPFAR within the country context of Mozambique. Minimum 5 years HIV/AIDS Public health experience required.  Experience in non-for-profit and/or government organization is required.  Bachelor degree in relevant area (communications, journalism, English, public relations) required.  Familiarity with PEPFAR Mozambique branding guidelines desired.  Strong English language skills required, familiarity with Portuguese language desired.</p>
<p>Interested parties, please submit CV and writing example.  Writing example can be a published article, speech, or report, demonstrating ability to relate to the public, preferably written on the subject of HIV/AIDS.</p>
<p>Please submit quote broken down by four separate line items for each element of the press kit.</p>
<p>For further information regarding the announcement please contact the United States Embassy Maputo, Mozambique by email to Ms. Zelia Vaz, VazZ@state.gov  and Ms. Joanna Knueppel, knueppelje@state.gov</p>

<DESC>The software supports other OEA requirements: federated search to allow the end user to search across multiple Installations and business lines in one search; server side transformation of data; data provisioning tools allows analysts to extract data for field deployed systems; and enterprise security using Lightweight Directory Access Protocol or Microsoft Active Directory to prevent certain information from being used or shared.
<p>The company, Voyager GIS, provides a unique capability in that its software can inventory and analyze agency scale data and services in both open and vendor specific data formats. Use of the Voyager GIS software is expected to increase data reuse, reducing storage and management costs while increasing productivity and reducing costs of conducting analysis. No other vendors offer the capabilities of this justification.</p>
