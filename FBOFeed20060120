<DESC>The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) which will solicit proposals to facilitate reporting to the National Practitioner Data Bank and to improve patient safety by continuing development of the “Prep 4 Patient Safety” program.  This program was funded in two previous contracts with the Practitioner Data Banks Branch of the Office of Workforce Evaluation and Quality Assurance, Bureau of Health Professions, Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA).  “PreP 4 Patient Safety” is a framework within which state medical, nursing and eventually other health professional licensing boards work with hospitals and other health care organizations to identify, remediate and monitor health care practitioners with deficiencies that cause concern but do not rise to the level of precipitating disciplinary action.  The outcomes anticipated are to: (a) create a trusting non-punitive environment, where health care organizations and licensing boards can identify and correct individual practitioners’ clinical deficiencies; (b) identify systemic issues that jeopardize patient safety; and (c) improve compliance with federal and state reporting requirements in situations which are not appropriate for “PreP 4 Patient Safety” remediation when reportable actions are taken.  Specific tasks shall include: (1) Creation of a working group of uniquely qualified representatives (i.e. state licensing boards, state legislative bodies or their national organizations, state professional associations, state hospital associations, risk managers or their national organizations, state based consumer organizations and others as appropriate) who have experience with the “PreP 4 Patient Safety” program in States where it has been proposed or implemented.  The purpose of the working group is to guide the development of tasks two and three;  (2) Prepare draft language that could be modified in the various states to put “PreP 4 Patient Safety” on a statutory basis; (3) Prepare educational materials concerning the draft statutory language that can be used by state licensing boards and other interested parties (4) Distribute drafts of the statutory language and educational materials developed for comment and suggested revisions; (5) Analyze comments and revise materials accordingly (6) Distribution of final draft statutory language and educational materials; (7) On going outreach to encourage and promote better reporting under federal and state mandatory reporting laws; (8) Provide technical assistance; (9) Prepare and disseminate a public report on “PreP 4 Patient Safety.”  It is anticipated that a cost reimbursement type contract will result from this solicitation.  It will be competed on a full and open basis.  The anticipated period of performance is 24 months from award of contract.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 561499 “All Other Business Support Services.”  The solicitation document will be available at: www.fedbizopps.gov- Main Menu, under Health and Human Services (HHS), Offices, Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), Locations, Division of Procurement Management.  Solicitation Number 06-N230-5501dm and will be posted as an attachment to this announcement on or about February 2, 2006 with a projected closing date on or about March 6, 2006. The contact person for this requirement is Daniel Matusiewicz, Contract Specialist, Division of Procurement Management (DPM), OMPS/HRSA, Parklawn Building, Room 13A-19, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857-5600; phone number 301.443.4703; fax 301.443.5462.

<DESC>NOTICE:  THIS AMENDS THE PREVIOUSLY ISSUED COMBINED SOLICITATION NOTICE NUMBER AG-52KY-06-S-2001 POSTED ON 01/19/2006 TO ALLOW POSTING OF PERTINENT DOCUMENTS.

ANYONE WHO APPLIES TO BOTH ANNOUNCEMENTS WILL BE CONSIDERED.  THE FOLLOWING IS A REPEAT OF PREVIOUS POSTING.


This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
Solicitation AG-52KY-S-06-2001 is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).   The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-08.  

The Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service, Indiana State Office intends to award Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) to small business sources capable of providing real estate appraisals throughout the state of Indiana for a period of approximately three years.  A BPA does not obligate the Government to order or the vendor to furnish any articles of any quantity except to the extent that may be agreed upon in connection with individual transactions.  Obligation is made at the time of an actual order.

Appraisers shall be a State Certified General Real Property Appraiser or obtain a temporary practice permit in Indiana and be in good standing with the licensing authority where the credential was issued.  Appraisers must demonstrate competency in compliance with Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) in conducting appraisals of agricultural properties with and without conservation easements of the requested type.  All appraisals completed for this program shall comply with USPAP, Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions (UASFLA aka Yellow Book) and Supplemental Standards as issued by NRCS.  

USDA NRCS is also seeking sources capable of providing technical appraisal reviews of appraisals done by other vendors within the state of Indiana.  Review Appraisers shall be a State Certified General Real Property Appraiser and be in good standing with the licensing authority where the credential was issued.  The review appraiser must have demonstrated competency in compliance with USPAP in conducting appraisal reviews of agricultural properties with and without conservation easements of the requested type.  Documentation of appraisal education courses attended such as eminent domain or conservation easements and UASFLA course and at least 40 hours of training in conducting technical reviews shall be provided by the review appraiser to the authorized official.  

This is 100% set-aside for small-business.  The associated NAICS code is 531320 and the small business size standard is $2 million in average annual receipts.  

The provisions at FAR 52.212-1 and 52.212-2  apply to this solicitation.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: technical capability of the item offered to meet the Government requirement; price; past performance (see FAR 15.304). 

The clause at FAR 52.212-4 applies to this acquisition. The clause at FAR 52.212-5 applies (attached).  Additional terms and conditions may be contained in the draft BPA as attached.    


Multiple awards will be considered.  A draft BPA is attached that contains additional information.          

For planning purposes there are approximately 50 appraisals to be done before September 30, 2006.  History for the last three years is as follows:  FY 2003 – 60 appraisals; FY 2004 – 87 appraisals; and FY 2005 – 91 appraisals.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for 400 PC of 6061-T6, 7.5 liter aluminum pressure vessel liners. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from SAMTECH International, 1130 E. Dominguez St., Carson, CA 90746, pursuant to FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), for the acquisition of supplies or services determined to be reasonably available from only one source. Competition is impractical for the following reasons: 1.  SAMTECH International is the only known source that is capable of satisfying the Government’s requirements for this specific aluminum liner.  They have developed tooling processes that are already in place, and the time and costs associated with duplicating the engineering and development to fabricate a similar liner would be impractical since it is already readily available from SAMTECH and can be delivered rapidly in time to satisfy the Government’s delivery requirements. 2.  SAMTECH International utilizes a proprietary manufacturing process to fabricate these aluminum liners that is not available from other sources.  Their proprietary flow-forming process involves a heated mandrel system which produces seamless aluminum liners of a very consistent wall thickness. The flow-formed aluminum liners have no welds; they are heat treated and ported. These aluminum liners will be used as a method to compare the performance of composite materials on cryogenic tanks.	The composite material will be over-wrapped on the aluminum liner, oven cured, and burst tested with water.  The aluminum liner contributes to the tank strength and it is extremely important that the liners be manufactured by the same source to ensure that the characteristics and strength of each liner are consistent.	  3.  Many test vessels have been produced at MSFC using this liner and considerable resources would be required to re-do tank development if the tank liner were changed.  There are variations between manufacturers.  The use of an aluminum tank liner from another source would void the enormous cost already spent on the development of test data and make that data non-usable.	Therefore, it would be economically and technically prudent to continue using the same tank liner and manufacturing method to obtain consistent test results. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on January 27, 2006.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC>The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has a requirement to provide the Office of Pesticides Programs with economic analysis support for the Biological and Economical Analysis Division (BEAD). EPA is required to make regulatory decisions on pesticides in line with the mandate under The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) [PL 100-532]. In order to accomplish this, economic analyses are needed in connection with the review of existing regulations, and the development of rule making, policies, guidance and statory amendments for pesticide regulatory programs. These various analyses are needed in order to provide EPA with adequate economic and biological information in making the initial decisions internally, for purposes of preparing reports for release, for regulatory development and evaluation. Analyses and information are also needed to support new major initiatives at EPA, such as reducing the use of high risk pesticides. Requirements will be to (1) conduct economic analyses of pesticide regulatory program rule making, policies, strategies, or legislation on the pesticide producing industry, (2) conduct analyses of the impacts of pesticide regulator actions, e.g, restrictions or banning use of a pesticide or combination (cluster) of pesticides on a particular site or crop, (3) conduct analyses on the biological and economic effects and impacts of policies, strategies, regulations, incentives, and other actions whose purpose are to reduce the use or the risk of pesticides. Appropriate Conflict of Interest (COI), Confidential Business Information (CBI) and FIFRA clauses may apply to these requirements. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541690. The anticipated contract will be a Cost Plus Fixed Fee type with a 12-month base period and four 12-month option periods. The Request for proposals (RFP) should be posted on the internet on or about February 3, 2006. Proposals shall be due approximately forty-five (45) days after the RFP issuance date.

<DESC>AIR MOBILITY BATTLELAB
BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT


PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY.     THE 305th CONTRACTING SQUADRON, pursuant to this BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA), SOLICITS CONCEPT PAPERS IN SUPPORT OF THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE AIR MOBILITY BATTLELAB.

A. INTRODUCTION:     The United States Air Force (USAF) Air Mobility Battlelab (AMB) is the Mobility Air Forces (MAF) catalyst for innovation across the spectrum of MAF missions and skills.  We evaluate existing and/or modified commercial-off-the shelf (COTS) and government-off-the-shelf (GOTS) technologies for mobility applications.  The AMB capitalizes on links with industry, laboratories, academia and MAF professionals, to advance the USAF distinctive capabilities of Rapid Global Mobility and Agile Combat Support.     Our primary focus is on identifying and investigating initiatives capable of being demonstrated in 18 months.     Through this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), AMB invites solution white papers with rough-order-of-magnitude cost and schedule estimates that address technological innovations and/or process improvements in the area of Expeditionary Combat Support (ECS).

This BAA is issued under the provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) paragraphs 35.016 and 6.102(d)(2) which provides for the competitive selection of technology demonstration proposals.  Contracts awarded based on responses to this BAA are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of Public Law 98-369, "The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984."     Responses shall reference Solicitation Number.     THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS EFFECTIVE UNTIL 30 SEP 06, AND WHITE PAPERS MAY BE SUBMITTED AT ANY TIME UP TO THAT DATE.     AMB considers submissions by evaluation of a five page white paper.  A copy of this BAA is also posted on the World Wide Web at http://public.mcguire.amc.af.mil/AMWC/battlelab.htm. 

B. OBJECTIVE:     Technical Description.  AMB solicits innovative white papers addressing solutions to identified MAF needs in the area of ECS.  White papers should contain proposals for using existing or modified COTS or GOTS items to reduce the overall deployment footprint, e.g., volume, weight, and/or size of the equipment needed to conduct and support MAF operations at deployed locations.  Footprint reduction should not come at the expense of durability, adequacy in capability and power, and usability in prolonged operations.

ECS equipment should be simple in design and minimize the need for special tools.  Equipment configurations should avoid/minimize the need for any special support equipment beyond off-the-shelf assets.  All special equipment/tools required for assembly will be organic to ECS systems/components.  ECS systems /components must be air transportable

ECS systems/components must be robust enough for diverse and harsh environments worldwide and operable in all climatic conditions.  Integrated ECS systems will provide the capability to support operations for an extended period.  ECS systems/components must withstand numerous and extended storage/deployment/use cycles.

ECS systems/components design must facilitate deployability, mission sizing, transportability, and storage.  Modularity for oversized or heavy items should be addressed and should not entail a large assembly burden on deploying forces.  

ECS systems must also be quick to:  set up, become operational upon arrival at the deployed location, strike when the deployed capability is no longer required, and be designed for ease of reconstitution or disposal.

AMB prefers to use contractor-loaned equipment or to participate in Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs), but does have limited funding for demonstrations.  Ultimately, the AMB conducts operational demonstrations of innovative mobility concepts, evaluates their military worth, and presents its assessments to senior decision makers including the Commander of the Air Mobility Warfare Center, the Commander of Air Mobility Command, Commander U.S. Transportation Command, and the Chief of Staff of the USAF. 

Submitters are encouraged to visit http://public.mcguire.amc.af.mil/AMWC/battlelab.htm to view a current list of AMB innovation areas.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Metabolism Branch (MB) plans to enter into a sole source procurement for GMP Storage and Delivery of Clinical Grade GMP Reagents with Fisher BioServices Inc., 7564 Standish Place, Suite 108, Rockville, MD  20855.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 493120 and the business size standard is $21.5M.  This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 – Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.5 to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions.  In its effort to bring new drugs successfully into the clinic, drugs developed in the MB are contracted to be made under Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) to meet FDA standards for use in clinical trials involving human patients.  These drugs must be stored at -70 degrees under FDA GMP regulations at a GMP approved facility that is within one hour roundtrip drive of the NIH Clinical Center Hospital.  The facility must be within one hour should a need arise on an emergency basis in order to treat a patient on protocol.  Any deviation from this specification could ruin countless hours of Government effort spent in drug development, manufacturing costs and testing and could invalidate critical clinical trials and or patient health.  Fisher BioServices is the only vendor known to the NCI researcher that is within one hour roundtrip of the NCI Clinical Center that has a GMP approved facility and can store clinical materials at -70 degrees under FDA GMP regulations.  This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 pm EST, on January 30, 2006.  Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized.  All questions must be in writing and may be emailed to Debbie Moore at dm170b@nih.gov or faxed (301) 402-4513.  It is the vendor’s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 and verify that questions were received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to award a non-competitive, sole source purchase order to Herzog Automation Corporation, 16600 Sprague Rd. Suite 400 Cleveland, OH 44130.  FDA will purchase one (1) Pellet Press from Herzog.  The pellet press is being requested solely from Herzog because we already have piston and die sets that go with Herzog equipment and because this Herzog press offers the unique die size, unavailable from other manufacturers of automated presses that we require for preparing pellets that fit into liquid XRF cups, which is part of our standard operating procedure.
This equipment will be added to existing equipment manufactured by the contractor and will increase the holding capacity at the animal facilities at FDA.  

NO REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE.   Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of providing the required service as stated herein may submit a capability statement to document its ability to provide the required services, which will be considered if received by the tenth (10th) calendar day following the appearance of this announcement.  A determination to compete this procurement based on a response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  All responses or questions regarding this posting must be in writing and can be sent via email to joseph.pishioneri@fda.gov.  No phone calls will be accepted.  An award will be made in ten (10) calendar days from the date of this notice.  This sole source procurement will be awarded as a simplified acquisition for commercial items in accordance with FAR Subpart 13.5.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This requirement is being procured in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions Procedures. 
	(Background)

The western Pacific gray whale is currently listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List.  It is thought that no more than approximately 100 individuals remain in this stock.  The principal summer feeding area for the western gray whale is off Sakhalin Island in the Russian sector of the Okhotsk Sea, where a major oil and gas field is being developed (Weller et al. 2002).  During their annual migration, whales in this stock traverse the coastal waters of Japan, Korea, and China, where they are vulnerable to ship collisions and entanglement in fishing gear.  In addition, the whales may be vulnerable to several other human threats.  The waters off Sakhalin Island are critical to the conservation of this stock.  Further, because of this area’s importance to western gray whale, it is critical to our ability to gather stock structure, population status, life history and other data necessary to inform future management decisions.

<DESC>UPDATE, 3 NOV 04:  The T-6 COMBS Services acquisition webpage has been updated to include a Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP).  Please review the document in its entirety and submit comments and/or questions to the Contract Specialist cited therein no later than close of business 19 Nov  2004.  Comments may be submitted electronically.  If mailed, they must be  postmarked by close of business 19 Nov 2004. Please note that there has been one slight update to the Government  requirement.  In addition to the previously identified locations requiring COMBS Services support, the Government has updated the DRFP to now also include T-6 Modification Line or any other depot level repair location as part of the requirement.  The T-6 Modification Line is currently located at the Raytheon Aircraft Facility in Wichita, KS.  The requirement involves providing safety of flight parts support for aircraft on the mod line that have component failure unrelated to work performed at that location. UPDATE, 1 OCT 04:  Previously, it was adviced that ORCA would become  mandatory on 1 Oct 04.  However, the FAR final rule has not been published and no release date has been given.  If ORCA becomes effective after the RFP is on the street, the solicitation would be amended to add the ORCA requirement. UPDATE, 30 SEP 04:  Three attachments have been posted below.  These are: The Government briefing from the Industry Meetings held 23 Aug - 15 Sep 04, questions and answers (with Government comments)resulting from the meetings, and an updated acquistion schedule (Attachment 2). UPDATE, 1 SEP 04:  In the near future there will be a change to the FAR to  implement the On-Line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).  The "Open FAR Cases" report shows that the FAR final rule is being reviewed  byOMB, and after that review is complete the final rule will be issued. ORCA will become mandatory on 1 OCT 2004. ORCA will be a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the  collection of FAR level certs and reps on-line.  Potential offerors/ bidders will need to complete certs and reps online at least annually.   Contractors who already are registered in the Central Contractor  Registration (CCR) can get a head start by going to http://www.bpn.gov/orca  to activate their ORCA profiles. Any information specific to the JPATS COMBS Services RFP above and beyond  what ORCA entails will be included in the RFP. NOTE:  A NEW ATTACHMENT HAS BEEN ADDED AT THE END OF THIS  SYNOPSIS.  THIS IS AN INVITATION FOR INDUSTRY TO MEET WITH THE GOVERNMENT. The Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) Aircraft Program, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is conducting an additional market survey for the follow-on Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) of the T-6A Texan II aircraft.  We anticipate at most a  10-year (9 month basic and 9 annual ordering periods) Firm-Fixed Price/Time and Materials, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity IDIQ) contract with contract award in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15 no later than 30 Sep 2005.    NOTE:  THIS MARKET SURVEY SUPERCEDES PIXS SYNOPSIS 03R0009W (SOLICITATION #F33657-03-R-0009), WHICH WAS  PUBLISHED ON 28 Mar 03.  OUR ORIGINAL REQUIREMENT HAS  CHANGES; WE WILL BE ACQUIRING CONTRACTOR OPERATED MANAGED  BASE SUPPLY (COMBS) ONLY.  AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE SERVICE  WILL NO LONGER BE INCLUDED ON THIS ACTION.   T-6A Background The T-6A is a derivative of the Swiss Pilatus PC-9 MK II, which  uses Non-Developmental Items (NDI) or derivatives of  commercially available items to meet most system requirements.   The   T-6A was missionized by Raytheon Aircraft Company  (RAC), Wichita, Kansas to replace the United States Air Force  (USAF) T-37B and the United States Navy (USN) T-34C primary  training aircraft.  Raytheon owns the data rights to the T-6A  design and all peculiar support equipment.  The T-6A is a low  wing, high performance, pressurized, turboprop aerobatic trainer.   The T-6A will provide entry-level Facility in Wichita, KS.  The requirement involves providing safety of flight parts support for aircraft on the mod line that have component failure unrelated to work performed at that location.

The   T-6A was missionized by Raytheon Aircraft Company  (RAC), Wichita, Kansas to replace the United States Air Force  (USAF) T-37B and the United States Navy (USN) T-34C primary  training aircraft.  Raytheon owns the data rights to the T-6A  design and all peculiar support equipment.  The T-6A is a low  wing, high performance, pressurized, turboprop aerobatic trainer.   The T-6A will provide entry-level students with the skills  necessary for contact/familiarization, instruments, formation, and  navigation during both day and night conditions.   T-6A training  will lead to a level of proficiency that permits transition into one  of the USAF or USN advanced pilot training tracks.   Current Environment There are presently 143 T-6As stationed at four main operating  bases (MOB):  Randolph AFB, Texas; Moody AFB, Georgia;  Laughlin AFB, Texas; and Naval Air Station (NAS) Pensacola,  Florida.  At the end of this 10-year CLS follow-on support  contract (through FY 2015), there will be a total of 782 aircraft in  the field stationed at these four MOBs and these additional bases:  Sheppard AFB, Texas; Vance AFB, Oklahoma; and Columbus  AFB, Mississippi; NAS Whiting, Florida; and NAS Corpus  Christi, Texas.   Currently, approximately 18% of the fleet has been delivered and  the production line is scheduled to continue through FY 2015 with  the production of 40-70 aircraft per year.  In addition, the USAF  anticipates approximately 30 Class I Engineering Change  Proposals through FY 2012 that will involve (but are not limited  to) both the airframe structural components (e.g., landing gear)  and avionics subsystems.  Attached is a list of some of the tasks in  the execution or planning stages that will affect the upcoming  CLS requirement. At this time, Raytheon Aircraft Company (RAC) provides both  the T-6A production and CLS COMBS functions for this program.   Presently, there are 4,000 line items that need to be managed; this  figure may change as engineering changes are accomplished to the  aircraft.  If the awardee of this contract is other than the  incumbent, the Government would require the establishment of an  Associate Contractor Agreement (ACA) with the aircraft  manufacture/ sustaining engineering contractor (Raytheon Aircraft  Company, Wichita KS) and major subsystem contractors for  avionics, engines, etc.  Approximately 60% of the dollar value of  spare parts is controlled by RAC proprietary drawings and designs  which only specific suppliers are licensed to manufacturer.  In  addition, all aircraft parts are required to be manufactured and  repaired under Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certified  processes to maintain airworthiness certification for military use. Follow-On Contract Description The CLS follow-on contract will procure COMBS support in  accordance with FAR 15 for the   T-6A aircraft at 11 Air Force  and Navy sites.  The contractor shall establish, operate and  manage a COMBS at each operating base providing a range and  depth (contractor determined) of spare parts/bench stock including  parts for off-equipment/I-Level backshops, spare engines, engine  Quick Engine Change (QEC) kits, engine modular components,  repair parts, peculiar (special) hand tools, support equipment (SE)  and expendables (including aircraft and SE bench stock) necessary  to support the assigned JPATS aircraft at the specified utilization  rate.  The contractor will ensure that all COMBS components are  FAA certified in accordance with FAA (Federal Aviation  Administration) Part 23.  The contractor shall ensure that all spare  parts are configured, painted and balanced (if required) for  immediate installation on JPATS aircraft in accordance with the  approved government technical data.  The contractor shall ensure  that all items with shelf-life restrictions are maintained within items  allowable limitations and tolerances.  No JPATS aircraft  component repair/maintenance shall be accomplished in the  COMBS.  The contractor shall only store JPATS aircraft parts,  TCTO kits and SE in the COMBS.  The contractor shall maintain  data outlining required protective packaging and transportation  requirements (electrostatic discharge sensitive items, fragile items,  hazardous materials, etc) for contractor furnished spare parts and  SE subject to special packaging requirements. The contractor shall support the bases’ daily flight operations and  any OPLAN, exercise, deployment, static display, fly-by,  incentive flight or open house that involves JPATS aircraft or  COMBS.  The contractor shall have spare parts and expendables  (not maintained in bench stock) available for the operating  command within 30 minutes after receipt of a valid demand on the  COMBS during normal duty hours and 30 minutes after arrival at  the base when on-call.  In addition, the contractor will ensure  housekeeping is performed in the COMBS facility. The COMBS contractor will be expected to maintain a current  COMBS spare inventory.  As     T-6A configuration changes are  accomplished on the production line, the COMBS contractor will  update COMBS inventory as appropriate. The COMBS contractor will be expected to provide all support  equipme          offer.           a.  Do you offer preferred customer discounts?       7.

<DESC>UPDATE, 1 SEP 04:  In the near future there will be a change to the FAR to implement the  On-Line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).  The "Open FAR  Cases" report shows that the FAR final rule is being reviewed by OMB, and after  that review is complete the final rule will be issued. ORCA will become mandatory on 1 OCT 2004. ORCA will be a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the  collection of FAR level certs and reps on-line.  Potential offerors/bidders  will need to complete certs and reps online at least annually.  Contractors who  already are registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) can get a  head start by going to http://www.bpn.gov/orca to activate their ORCA profiles. Any information specific to the JPATS COMBS Services RFP above and beyond what  ORCA entails will be included in the RFP. NOTE:  A NEW ATTACHMENT HAS BEEN ADDED AT THE END OF THIS  SYNOPSIS.  THIS IS AN INVITATION FOR INDUSTRY TO MEET WITH THE GOVERNMENT. The Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) Aircraft Program, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is conducting an additional market survey for the follow-on Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) of the T-6A Texan II aircraft.  We anticipate at most a  10-year (9 month basic and 9 annual ordering periods) Firm-Fixed Price/Time and Materials, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity IDIQ) contract with contract award in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15 no later than 30 Sep 2005.    NOTE:  THIS MARKET SURVEY SUPERCEDES PIXS SYNOPSIS 03R0009W (SOLICITATION #F33657-03-R-0009), WHICH WAS  PUBLISHED ON 28 Mar 03.  OUR ORIGINAL REQUIREMENT HAS  CHANGES; WE WILL BE ACQUIRING CONTRACTOR OPERATED MANAGED  BASE SUPPLY (COMBS) ONLY.  AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE SERVICE  WILL NO LONGER BE INCLUDED ON THIS ACTION.   T-6A Background The T-6A is a derivative of the Swiss Pilatus PC-9 MK II, which  uses Non-Developmental Items (NDI) or derivatives of  commercially available items to meet most system requirements.   The   T-6A was missionized by Raytheon Aircraft Company  (RAC), Wichita, Kansas to replace the United States Air Force  (USAF) T-37B and the United States Navy (USN) T-34C primary  training aircraft.  Raytheon owns the data rights to the T-6A  design and all peculiar support equipment.  The T-6A is a low  wing, high performance, pressurized, turboprop aerobatic trainer.   The T-6A will provide entry-level students with the skills  necessary for contact/familiarization, instruments, formation, and  navigation during both day and night conditions.   T-6A training  will lead to a level of proficiency that permits transition into one  of the USAF or USN advanced pilot training tracks.

<DESC>UPDATE, 4 FEB 05:  This update further elaborates on Question 23 and our response in the “Industry Questions and Responses 26 Jan 05”  attachment: Q23.  Over and Above schedule for source selection evaluation purposes  is located in the Bidder+s Library.  Today the contractor cannot find  such information in the Bidder+s Library.  Recommend a) Populate the  Bidders Library with the required information or b) have the Offeror  assume 1 occurrence per year and insert a units/per occurrence price. A23.  This schedule is in the bidder+s library.  It is listed under  "PWS Referenced Documents/Aircraft Maintenance Manuals" - 1T-6A-6 insp  Req Bidders Copy.pdf. The schedule is in bidder’s library under Section III of 1T-6A-6.   However, upon further review, it appears bidders would have to make  several assumptions.  Therefore, bidders should bid the Over and Above  Fixed Price CLINs (X006) using a quantity of one with the unit price.   Bidders should also indicate if there will be any discount for quantity  breaks.  Bidders need to review the requirements in the 1T-6A-6 insp Req Bidders copy.

The requirement involves providing safety of flight parts support for aircraft on the mod line that have component failure unrelated to work performed at that location. UPDATE, 1 OCT 04:  Previously, it was adviced that ORCA would become  mandatory on 1 Oct 04.  However, the FAR final rule has not been published and no release date has been given.  If ORCA becomes effective after the RFP is on the street, the solicitation would be amended to add the ORCA requirement. UPDATE, 30 SEP 04:  Three attachments have been posted below.  These are: The Government briefing from the Industry Meetings held 23 Aug - 15 Sep 04, questions and answers (with Government comments)resulting from the meetings, and an updated acquistion schedule (Attachment 2). UPDATE, 1 SEP 04:  In the near future there will be a change to the FAR to  implement the On-Line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).  The "Open FAR Cases" report shows that the FAR final rule is being reviewed  byOMB, and after that review is complete the final rule will be issued. ORCA will become mandatory on 1 OCT 2004. ORCA will be a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the  collection of FAR level certs and reps on-line.  Potential offerors/ bidders will need to complete certs and reps online at least annually.   Contractors who already are registered in the Central Contractor  Registration (CCR) can get a head start by going to http://www.bpn.gov/orca  to activate their ORCA profiles. Any information specific to the JPATS COMBS Services RFP above and beyond  what ORCA entails will be included in the RFP. NOTE:  A NEW ATTACHMENT HAS BEEN ADDED AT THE END OF THIS  SYNOPSIS.  THIS IS AN INVITATION FOR INDUSTRY TO MEET WITH THE GOVERNMENT. The Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) Aircraft Program, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is conducting an additional market survey for the follow-on Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) of the T-6A Texan II aircraft.  We anticipate at most a  10-year (9 month basic and 9 annual ordering periods) Firm-Fixed Price/Time and Materials, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity IDIQ) contract with contract award in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15 no later than 30 Sep 2005.    NOTE:  THIS MARKET SURVEY SUPERCEDES PIXS SYNOPSIS 03R0009W (SOLICITATION #F33657-03-R-0009), WHICH WAS  PUBLISHED ON 28 Mar 03.  OUR ORIGINAL REQUIREMENT HAS  CHANGES; WE WILL BE ACQUIRING CONTRACTOR OPERATED MANAGED  BASE SUPPLY (COMBS) ONLY.  AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE SERVICE  WILL NO LONGER BE INCLUDED ON THIS ACTION.   T-6A Background The T-6A is a derivative of the Swiss Pilatus PC-9 MK II, which  uses Non-Developmental Items (NDI) or derivatives of  commercially available items to meet most system requirements.   The   T-6A was missionized by Raytheon Aircraft Company  (RAC), Wichita, Kansas to replace the United States Air Force  (USAF) T-37B and the United States Navy (USN) T-34C primary  training aircraft.  Raytheon owns the data rights to the T-6A  design and all peculiar support equipment.  The T-6A is a low  wing, high performance, pressurized, turboprop aerobatic trainer.   The T-6A will provide entry-level students with the skills  necessary for contact/familiarization, instruments, formation, and  navigation during both day and night conditions.   T-6A training  will lead to a level of proficiency that permits transition into one  of the USAF or USN advanced pilot training tracks.   Current Environment There are presently 143 T-6As stationed at four main operating  bases (MOB):  Randolph AFB, Texas; Moody AFB, Georgia;  Laughlin AFB, Texas; and Naval Air Station (NAS) Pensacola,  Florida.  At the end of this 10-year CLS follow-on support  contract (through FY 2015), there will be a total of 782 aircraft in  the field stationed at these four MOBs and these additional bases:  Sheppard AFB, Texas; Vance AFB, Oklahoma; and Columbus  AFB, Mississippi; NAS Whiting, Florida; and NAS Corpus  Christi, Texas.   Currently, approximately 18% of the fleet has been delivered and  the production line is scheduled to continue through FY 2015 with  the production of 40-70 aircraft per year.  In addition, the USAF  anticipates approximately 30 Class I Engineering Change  Proposals through FY 2012 that will involve (but are not limited  to) both the airframe structural components (e.g., landing gear)  and avionics subsystems.  Attached is a list of some of the tasks in  the execution or planning stages that will affect the upcoming  CLS requirement. At this time, Raytheon Aircraft Company (RAC) provides both  the T-6A production and CLS COMBS functions for this program.   Presently, there are 4,000 line items that need to be managed; this  figure may change as engineering changes are accomplished to the  aircraft.  If the awardee of this contract is other than the  incumbent, the Government would require the establishment of an  Associate Contractor Agreement (ACA) with the aircraft  manufacture/ sustaining engineering contractor (Raytheon Aircraft  Company, Wichita KS) and major subsystem contractors for  avionics, engines, etc.  Approximately 60% of the dollar value of  spare parts is controlled by RAC proprietary drawings and designs  which only specific suppliers are licensed to manufacturer.  In  addition, all aircraft parts are required to be manufactured and  repaired under Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certified  processes to maintain airworthiness certification for military use. Follow-On Contract Description The CLS follow-on contract will procure COMBS support in  accordance with FAR 15 for the   T-6A aircraft at 11 Air Force  and Navy sites.  The contractor shall establish, operate and  manage a COMBS at each operating base providing a range and  depth (contractor determined) of spare parts/bench stock including  parts for off-equipment/I-Level backshops, spare engines, engine  Quick Engine Change (QEC) kits, engine modular components,  repair parts, peculiar (special) hand tools, support equipment (SE)  and expendables (including aircraft and SE bench stock) necessary  to support the assigned JPATS aircraft at the specified utilization  rate.  The contractor will ensure that all COMBS components are  FAA certified in accordance with FAA (Federal Aviation  Administration) Part 23.  The contractor shall ensure that all spare  parts are configured, painted and balanced (if required) for  immediate installation on JPATS aircraft in accordance ons are maintained within items  allowable limitations and tolerances.  No JPATS aircraft  component repair/maintenance shall be accomplished in the  COMBS.  The contractor shall only store JPATS aircraft parts,  TCTO kits and SE in the COMBS.  The contractor shall maintain  data outlining required protective packaging and transportation  requirements (electrostatic discharge sensitive items, fragile items,  hazardous materials, etc) for contractor furnished spare parts and  SE subject to special packaging requirements. The contractor shall support the bases’ daily flight operations and  any OPLAN, exercise, deployment, static display, fly-by,  incentive flight or open house that involves JPATS aircraft or  COMBS.  The contractor shall have spare parts and expendables  (not maintained in bench stock) available for the operating  command within 30 minutes after receipt of a valid demand on the  COMBS during normal duty hours and 30 minutes after arrival at  the base when on-call.  In addition, the contractor will ensure  housekeeping is performed in the COMBS facility. The COMBS contractor will be expected to maintain a current  COMBS spare inventory.  As     T-6A configuration changes are  accomplished on the production line, the COMBS contractor will  update COMBS inventory as appropriate. The COMBS contractor will be expected to provide all support  equipment required to operate and maintain the T-6A.  A list will  be provided in any request for proposal. The COMBS contractor will be expected to perform or  subcontract off-site Intermediate and Depot level repair of failed  reparable components.  A list of historical failure rates and the  CAGE code of the manufacturer will be provided in any request  for proposal. The COMBS contractor will be expected to provide their own  office equipment, phones, phone service, furniture, material  handling equipment, etc., required to operate the COMBS. The COMBS contractor will be expected to manage hazardous  material IAW current Federal, State and Base regulations.  T6-A  hazardous materials are limited to paints/solvents, oils/greases and  explosive components of the escape system. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL  SUBMISSION.

<DESC>UPDATE, 30 SEP 04:  Three attachments have been posted below.  These are: The Government briefing from the Industry Meetings held 23 Aug - 15 Sep 04, questions and answers (with Government comments)resulting from the meetings, and an updated acquistion schedule (Attachment 2). UPDATE, 1 SEP 04:  In the near future there will be a change to the FAR to  implement the On-Line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).  The "Open FAR Cases" report shows that the FAR final rule is being reviewed  byOMB, and after that review is complete the final rule will be issued. ORCA will become mandatory on 1 OCT 2004. ORCA will be a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the  collection of FAR level certs and reps on-line.  Potential offerors/ bidders will need to complete certs and reps online at least annually.   Contractors who already are registered in the Central Contractor  Registration (CCR) can get a head start by going to http://www.bpn.gov/orca  to activate their ORCA profiles. Any information specific to the JPATS COMBS Services RFP above and beyond  what ORCA entails will be included in the RFP. NOTE:  A NEW ATTACHMENT HAS BEEN ADDED AT THE END OF THIS  SYNOPSIS.  THIS IS AN INVITATION FOR INDUSTRY TO MEET WITH THE GOVERNMENT. The Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) Aircraft Program, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is conducting an additional market survey for the follow-on Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) of the T-6A Texan II aircraft.  We anticipate at most a  10-year (9 month basic and 9 annual ordering periods) Firm-Fixed Price/Time and Materials, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity IDIQ) contract with contract award in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15 no later than 30 Sep 2005.    NOTE:  THIS MARKET SURVEY SUPERCEDES PIXS SYNOPSIS 03R0009W (SOLICITATION #F33657-03-R-0009), WHICH WAS  PUBLISHED ON 28 Mar 03.  OUR ORIGINAL REQUIREMENT HAS  CHANGES; WE WILL BE ACQUIRING CONTRACTOR OPERATED MANAGED  BASE SUPPLY (COMBS) ONLY.  AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE SERVICE  WILL NO LONGER BE INCLUDED ON THIS ACTION.   T-6A Background The T-6A is a derivative of the Swiss Pilatus PC-9 MK II, which  uses Non-Developmental Items (NDI) or derivatives of  commercially available items to meet most system requirements.   The   T-6A was missionized by Raytheon Aircraft Company  (RAC), Wichita, Kansas to replace the United States Air Force  (USAF) T-37B and the United States Navy (USN) T-34C primary  training aircraft.  Raytheon owns the data rights to the T-6A  design and all peculiar support equipment.  The T-6A is a low  wing, high performance, pressurized, turboprop aerobatic trainer.   The T-6A will provide entry-level students with the skills  necessary for contact/familiarization, instruments, formation, and  navigation during both day and night conditions.   T-6A training  will lead to a level of proficiency that permits transition into one  of the USAF or USN advanced pilot training tracks.   Current Environment There are presently 143 T-6As stationed at four main operating  bases (MOB):  Randolph AFB, Texas; Moody AFB, Georgia;  Laughlin AFB, Texas; and Naval Air Station (NAS) Pensacola,  Florida.  At the end of this 10-year CLS follow-on support  contract (through FY 2015), there will be a total of 782 aircraft in  the field stationed at these four MOBs and these additional bases:  Sheppard AFB, Texas; Vance AFB, Oklahoma; and Columbus  AFB, Mississippi; NAS Whiting, Florida; and NAS Corpus  Christi, Texas.   Currently, approximately 18% of the fleet has been delivered and  the production line is scheduled to continue through FY 2015 with  the production of 40-70 aircraft per year.  In addition, the USAF  anticipates approximately 30 Class I Engineering Change  Proposals through FY 2012 that will involve (but are not limited  to) both the airframe structural components (e.g., landing gear)  and avionics subsystems.  Attached is a list of some of the tasks in  the execution or planninddition, the USAF  anticipates approximately 30 Class I Engineering Change  Proposals through FY 2012 that will involve (but are not limited  to) both the airframe structural components (e.g., landing gear)  and avionics subsystems.  Attached is a list of some of the tasks in  the execution or planning stages that will affect the upcoming  CLS requirement. At this time, Raytheon Aircraft Company (RAC) provides both  the T-6A production and CLS COMBS functions for this program.   Presently, there are 4,000 line items that need to be managed; this  figure may change as engineering changes are accomplished to the  aircraft.  If the awardee of this contract is other than the  incumbent, the Government would require the establishment of an  Associate Contractor Agreement (ACA) with the aircraft  manufacture/ sustaining engineering contractor (Raytheon Aircraft  Company, Wichita KS) and major subsystem contractors for  avionics, engines, etc.  Approximately 60% of the dollar value of  spare parts is controlled by RAC proprietary drawings and designs  which only specific suppliers are licensed to manufacturer.  In  addition, all aircraft parts are required to be manufactured and  repaired under Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certified  processes to maintain airworthiness certification for military use. Follow-On Contract Description The CLS follow-on contract will procure COMBS support in  accordance with FAR 15 for the   T-6A aircraft at 11 Air Force  and Navy sites.  The contractor shall establish, operate and  manage a COMBS at each operating base providing a range and  depth (contractor determined) of spare parts/bench stock including  parts for off-equipment/I-Level backshops, spare engines, engine  Quick Engine Change (QEC) kits, engine modular components,  repair parts, peculiar (special) hand tools, support equipment (SE)  and expendables (including aircraft and SE bench stock) necessary  to support the assigned JPATS aircraft at the specified utilization  rate.  The contractor will ensure that all COMBS components are  FAA certified in accordance with FAA (Federal Aviation  Administration) Part 23.  The contractor shall ensure that all spare  parts are configured, painted and balanced (if required) for  immediate installation on JPATS aircraft in accordance with the  approved government technical data.  The contractor shall ensure  that all items with shelf-life restrictions are maintained within items  allowable limitations and tolerances.  No JPATS aircraft  component repair/maintenance shall be accomplished in the  COMBS.  The contractor shall only store JPATS aircraft parts,  TCTO kits and SE in the COMBS.  The contractor shall maintain  data outlining required protective packaging and transportation  requirements (electrostatic discharge sensitive items, fragile items,  hazardous materials, etc) for contractor furnished spare parts and  SE subject to special packaging requirements. The contractor shall support the bases’ daily flight operations and  any OPLAN, exercise, deployment, static display, fly-by,  incentive flight or open house that involves JPATS aircraft or  COMBS.  The contractor shall have spare parts and expendables  (not maintained in bench stock) available for the operating  command within 30 minutes after receipt of a valid demand on the  COMBS during normal duty hours and 30 minutes after arrival at  the base when on-call.  In addition, the contractor will ensure  housekeeping is performed in the COMBS facility. The COMBS contractor will be expected to maintain a current  COMBS spare inventory.  As     T-6A configuration changes are  accomplished on the production line, the COMBS contractor will  update COMBS inventory as appropriate. The COMBS contractor will be expected to provide all support  equipment required to operate and maintain the T-6A.  A list will  be provided in any request for proposal. The COMBS contractor will be expected to perform or  subcontract off-site Intermediate and Depot level repair of failed  reparable components.  A list of historical failure rates and the  CAGE code of the manufacturer will be provided in any request  for proposal. The COMBS contractor will be expected to provide their own  office equipment, phones, phone service, furniture, material  handling equipment, etc., required to operate the COMBS. The COMBS contractor will be expected to manage hazardous  material IAW current Federal, State and Base regulations.  T6-A  hazardous materials are limited to paints/solvents, oils/greases and  explosive components of the escape system. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL  SUBMISSION.

<DESC>UPDATE, 30 DEC 04:  The T-6 COMBS Services acquisition webpage has been updated to include the Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP) in response to the questions/comments to the DRFP posted 3 Nov 04.  Only documents with changes/updates are posted.  This includes the updated DRFP, Section L and Section M.  Blue change bars highlight changes made.  A document entitled "Industry Questions and Responses, 30 Dec 04" has also been posted.  Questions can be directed to Cheryle Lankford, 937-904-4197, or Capt. Jason Ortiz, 937-904-4609.  UPDATE, 24 NOV 04:  Our e-mail system went down November 12 and was out not fixed until sometime the following week.  As a result, some e-mail  was lost.  If you sent an e-mail responding to the draft RFP during that  time, it may not have been received.  If an e-mail was sent and you did not receive any response from our office advising receipt of the e-mail, please resubmit.  We apologize for any inconvenience. UPDATE, 4 NOV 04:  The files posted 3 Nov 04 for Attachment 2 (MESL) and  Attachment 3 (MESM)were incorrect as the titles had been erroneously  switched for the files.  These files have been deleted and the correct files have been reposted with a 4 Nov 04 date. UPDATE, 3 NOV 04:  The T-6 COMBS Services acquisition webpage has been updated to include a Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP).  Please review the document in its entirety and submit comments and/or questions to the Contract Specialist cited therein no later than close of business 19 Nov  2004.  Comments may be submitted electronically.  If mailed, they must be  postmarked by close of business 19 Nov 2004. Please note that there has been one slight update to the Government  requirement.  In addition to the previously identified locations requiring COMBS Services support, the Government has updated the DRFP to now also include T-6 Modification Line or any other depot level repair location as part of the requirement.  The T-6 Modification Line is currently located at the Raytheon Aircraft Facility in Wichita, KS.  The requirement involves providing safety of flight parts support for aircraft on the mod line that have component failure unrelated to work performed at that location. UPDATE, 1 OCT 04:  Previously, it was adviced that ORCA would become  mandatory on 1 Oct 04.  However, the FAR final rule has not been published and no release date has been given.  If ORCA becomes effective after the RFP is on the street, the solicitation would be amended to add the ORCA requirement. UPDATE, 30 SEP 04:  Three attachments have been posted below.  These are: The Government briefing from the Industry Meetings held 23 Aug - 15 Sep 04, questions and answers (with Government comments)resulting from the meetings, and an updated acquistion schedule (Attachment 2). UPDATE, 1 SEP 04:  In the near future there will be a change to the FAR to  implement the On-Line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).  The "Open FAR Cases" report shows that the FAR final rule is being reviewed  byOMB, and after that review is complete the final rule will be issued. ORCA will become mandatory on 1 OCT 2004.

Presently, there are 4,000 line items that need to be managed; this  figure may change as engineering changes are accomplished to the  aircraft.  If the awardee of this contract is other than the  incumbent, the Government would require the establishment of an  Associate Contractor Agreement (ACA) with the aircraft  manufacture/ sustaining engineering contractor (Raytheon Aircraft  Company, Wichita KS) and major subsystem contractors for  avionics, engines, etc.  Approximately 60% of the dollar value of  spare parts is controlled by RAC proprietary drawings and designs  which only specific suppliers are licensed to manufacturer.  In  addition, all aircraft parts are required to be manufactured and  repaired under Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certified  processes to maintain airworthiness certification for military use. Follow-On Contract Description The CLS follow-on contract will procure COMBS support in  accordance with FAR 15 for the   T-6A aircraft at 11 Air Force  and Navy sites.  The contractor shall establish, operate and  manage a COMBS at each operating base providing a range and  depth (contractor determined) of spare parts/bench stock including  parts for off-equipment/I-Level backshops, spare engines, engine  Quick Engine Change (QEC) kits, engine modular components,  repair parts, peculiar (special) hand tools, support equipment (SE)  and expendables (including aircraft and SE bench stock) necessary  to support the assigned JPATS aircraft at the specified utilization  rate.  The contractor will ensure that all COMBS components are  FAA certified in accordance with FAA (Federal Aviation  Administration) Part 23.  The contractor shall ensure that all spare  parts are configured, painted and balanced (if required) for  immediate installation on JPATS aircraft in accordance with the  approved government technical data.  The contractor shall ensure  that all items with shelf-life restrictions are maintained within items  allowable limitations and tolerances.  No JPATS aircraft  component repair/maintenance shall be accomplished in the  COMBS.  The contractor shall only store JPATS aircraft parts,  TCTO kits and SE in the COMBS.  The contractor shall maintain  data outlining required protective packaging and transportation  requirements (electrostatic discharge sensitive items, fragile items,  hazardous materials, etc) for contractor furnished spare parts and  SE subject to special packaging requirements. The contractor shall support the bases’ daily flight operations and  any OPLAN, exercise, deployment, static display, fly-by,  incentive flight or open house that involves JPATS aircraft or  COMBS.  The contractor shall have spare parts and expendables  (not maintained in bench stock) available for the operating  command within 30 minutes after receipt of a valid demand on the  COMBS during normal duty hours and 30 minutes after arrival at  the base when on-call.  In addition, the contractor will ensure  housekeeping is performed in the COMBS facility. The COMBS contractor will be expected to maintain a current  COMBS spare inventory.  As     T-6A configuration changes are  accomplished on the production line, the COMBS contractor will  update COMBS inventory as appropriate. The COMBS contractor will be expected to provide all support  equipment required to operate and maintain the T-6A.  A list will  be provided in any request for proposal. The COMBS contractor will be expected to perform or  subcontract off-site Intermediate and Depot level repair of failed  reparable components.

<DESC>UPDATE, 12 JAN 05:  The Bidder+s Library has been posted. UPDATE, 12 JAN 05:  The final RFP is hereby released.  Also attached are the Acquisition Schedule and 2 PCO letters (Source Selection  Notification and Request for Proposal).  Please note Shannon Prince is no longer a POC for this effort.  The current POCs are:  Cheryle Lankford (937-904-4197), Capt. Jason Ortiz (937-904-4609) and Trini Rendon (937-904-4286). UPDATE, 3 JAN 05:  Regarding the Draft RFP posted 30 Dec 04, please be advised that the updated DRAFT RFP has a potential for up to a 10  year period of performance as opposed to the original 5 year period of performance.  All comments/questions to the current Draft RFP  should be received no later than 12:00 EST on 10 Jan 05.  The  Government may not respond with direct answers but may incorporate  comments into the Final RFP. UPDATE, 30 DEC 04:  The T-6 COMBS Services acquisition webpage has been updated to include the Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP) in response to the questions/comments to the DRFP posted 3 Nov 04.  Only documents with changes/updates are posted.  This includes the updated DRFP, Section L and Section M.  Blue change bars highlight changes made.  A document entitled "Industry Questions and Responses, 30 Dec 04" has also been posted.  Questions can be directed to Cheryle Lankford, 937-904-4197, or Capt. Jason Ortiz, 937-904-4609.  UPDATE, 24 NOV 04:  Our e-mail system went down November 12 and was out not fixed until sometime the following week.  As a result, some e-mail  was lost.  If you sent an e-mail responding to the draft RFP during that  time, it may not have been received.  If an e-mail was sent and you did not receive any response from our office advising receipt of the e-mail, please resubmit.  We apologize for any inconvenience. UPDATE, 4 NOV 04:  The files posted 3 Nov 04 for Attachment 2 (MESL) and  Attachment 3 (MESM)were incorrect as the titles had been erroneously  switched for the files.  These files have been deleted and the correct files have been reposted with a 4 Nov 04 date. UPDATE, 3 NOV 04:  The T-6 COMBS Services acquisition webpage has been updated to include a Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP).  Please review the document in its entirety and submit comments and/or questions to the Contract Specialist cited therein no later than close of business 19 Nov  2004.  Comments may be submitted electronically.  If mailed, they must be  postmarked by close of business 19 Nov 2004. Please note that there has been one slight update to the Government  requirement.  In addition to the previously identified locations requiring COMBS Services support, the Government has updated the DRFP to now also include T-6 Modification Line or any other depot level repair location as part of the requirement.  The T-6 Modification Line is currently located at the Raytheon Aircraft Facility in Wichita, KS.  The requirement involves providing safety of flight parts support for aircraft on the mod line that have component failure unrelated to work performed at that location. UPDATE, 1 OCT 04:  Previously, it was adviced that ORCA would become  mandatory on 1 Oct 04.  However, the FAR final rule has not been published and no release date has been given.  If ORCA becomes effective after the RFP is on the street, the solicitation would be amended to add the ORCA requirement. UPDATE, 30 SEP 04:  Three attachments have been posted below.  These are: The Government briefing from the Industry Meetings held 23 Aug - 15 Sep 04, questions and answers (with Government comments)resulting from the meetings, and an updated acquistion schedule (Attachment 2). UPDATE, 1 SEP 04:  In the near future there will be a change to the FAR to  implement the On-Line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).  The "Open FAR Cases" report shows that the FAR final rule is being reviewed  byOMB, and after that review is complete the final rule will be issued. ORCA will become mandatory on 1 OCT 2004. ORCA will be a webstudents with the skills  necessary for contact/familiarization, instruments, formation, and  navigation during both day and night conditions.   T-6A training  will lead to a level of proficiency that permits transition into one  of the USAF or USN advanced pilot training tracks.   Current Environment There are presently 143 T-6As stationed at four main operating  bases (MOB):  Randolph AFB, Texas; Moody AFB, Georgia;  Laughlin AFB, Texas; and Naval Air Station (NAS) Pensacola,  Florida.  At the end of this 10-year CLS follow-on support  contract (through FY 2015), there will be a total of 782 aircraft in  the field stationed at these four MOBs and these additional bases:  Sheppard AFB, Texas; Vance AFB, Oklahoma; and Columbus  AFB, Mississippi; NAS Whiting, Florida; and NAS Corpus  Christi, Texas.   Currently, approximately 18% of the fleet has been delivered and  the production line is scheduled to continue through FY 2015 with  the production of 40-70 aircraft per year.  In addition, the USAF  anticipates approximately 30 Class I Engineering Change  Proposals through FY 2012 that will involve (but are not limited  to) both the airframe structural components (e.g., landing gear)  and avionics subsystems.  Attached is a list of some of the tasks in  the execution or planning stages that will affect the upcoming  CLS requirement.

UPDATE, 4 NOV 04:  The files posted 3 Nov 04 for Attachment 2 (MESL) and  Attachment 3 (MESM)were incorrect as the titles had been erroneously  switched for the files.  These files have been deleted and the correct files have been reposted with a 4 Nov 04 date. UPDATE, 3 NOV 04:  The T-6 COMBS Services acquisition webpage has been updated to include a Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP).  Please review the document in its entirety and submit comments and/or questions to the Contract Specialist cited therein no later than close of business 19 Nov  2004.  Comments may be submitted electronically.  If mailed, they must be  postmarked by close of business 19 Nov 2004. Please note that there has been one slight update to the Government  requirement.  In addition to the previously identified locations requiring COMBS Services support, the Government has updated the DRFP to now also include T-6 Modification Line or any other depot level repair location as part of the requirement.  The T-6 Modification Line is currently located at the Raytheon Aircraft Facility in Wichita, KS.  The requirement involves providing safety of flight parts support for aircraft on the mod line that have component failure unrelated to work performed at that location. UPDATE, 1 OCT 04:  Previously, it was adviced that ORCA would become  mandatory on 1 Oct 04.  However, the FAR final rule has not been published and no release date has been given.  If ORCA becomes effective after the RFP is on the street, the solicitation would be amended to add the ORCA requirement. UPDATE, 30 SEP 04:  Three attachments have been posted below.  These are: The Government briefing from the Industry Meetings held 23 Aug - 15 Sep 04, questions and answers (with Government comments)resulting from the meetings, and an updated acquistion schedule (Attachment 2). UPDATE, 1 SEP 04:  In the near future there will be a change to the FAR to  implement the On-Line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).  The "Open FAR Cases" report shows that the FAR final rule is being reviewed  byOMB, and after that review is complete the final rule will be issued. ORCA will become mandatory on 1 OCT 2004. ORCA will be a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the  collection of FAR level certs and reps on-line.  Potential offerors/ bidders will need to complete certs and reps online at least annually.   Contractors who already are registered in the Central Contractor  Registration (CCR) can get a head start by going to http://www.bpn.gov/orca  to activate their ORCA profiles. Any information specific to the JPATS COMBS Servieering changes are accomplished to the  aircraft.  If the awardee of this contract is other than the  incumbent, the Government would require the establishment of an  Associate Contractor Agreement (ACA) with the aircraft  manufacture/ sustaining engineering contractor (Raytheon Aircraft  Company, Wichita KS) and major subsystem contractors for  avionics, engines, etc.  Approximately 60% of the dollar value of  spare parts is controlled by RAC proprietary drawings and designs  which only specific suppliers are licensed to manufacturer.  In  addition, all aircraft parts are required to be manufactured and  repaired under Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certified  processes to maintain airworthiness certification for military use. Follow-On Contract Description The CLS follow-on contract will procure COMBS support in  accordance with FAR 15 for the   T-6A aircraft at 11 Air Force  and Navy sites.  The contractor shall establish, operate and  manage a COMBS at each operating base providing a range and  depth (contractor determined) of spare parts/bench stock including  parts for off-equipment/I-Level backshops, spare engines, engine  Quick Engine Change (QEC) kits, engine modular components,  repair parts, peculiar (special) hand tools, support equipment (SE)  and expendables (including aircraft and SE bench stock) necessary  to support the assigned JPATS aircraft at the specified utilization  rate.  The contractor will ensure that all COMBS components are  FAA certified in accordance with FAA (Federal Aviation  Administration) Part 23.  The contractor shall ensure that all spare  parts are configured, painted and balanced (if required) for  immediate installation on JPATS aircraft in accordance with the  approved government technical data.  The contractor shall ensure  that all items with shelf-life restrictions are maintained within items  allowable limitations and tolerances.  No JPATS aircraft  component repair/maintenance shall be accomplished in the  COMBS.  The contractor shall only store JPATS aircraft parts,  TCTO kits and SE in the COMBS.  The contractor shall maintain  data outlining required protective packaging and transportation  requirements (electrostatic discharge sensitive items, fragile items,  hazardous materials, etc) for contractor furnished spare parts and  SE subject to special packaging requirements. The contractor shall support the bases’ daily flight operations and  any OPLAN, exercise, deployment, static display, fly-by,  incentive flight or open house that involves JPATS aircraft or  COMBS.  The contractor shall have spare parts and expendables  (not maintained in bench stock) available for the operating  command within 30 minutes after receipt of a valid demand on the  COMBS during normal duty hours and 30 minutes after arrival at  the base when on-call.  In addition, the contractor will ensure  housekeeping is performed in the COMBS facility. The COMBS contractor will be expected to maintain a current  COMBS spare inventory.  As     T-6A configuration changes are  accomplished on the production line, the COMBS contractor will  update COMBS inventory as appropriate. The COMBS contractor will be expected to provide all support  equipment required to operate and maintain the T-6A.  A list will  be provided in any request for proposal. The COMBS contractor will be expected to perform or  subcontract off-site Intermediate and Depot level repair of failed  reparable components.  A list of historical failure rates and the  CAGE code of the manufacturer will be provided in any request  for proposal. The COMBS contractor will be expected to provide their own  office equipment, phones, phone service, furniture, material  handling equipment, etc., required to operate the COMBS. The COMBS contractor will be expected to manage hazardous  material IAW current Federal, State and Base regulations.  T6-A  hazardous materials are limited to paints/solvents, oils/greases and  explosive components of the escape system. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL  SUBMISSION.

THIS IS AN INVITATION FOR INDUSTRY TO MEET WITH THE GOVERNMENT. The Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) Aircraft Program, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is conducting an additional market survey for the follow-on Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) of the T-6A Texan II aircraft.  We anticipate at most a  10-year (9 month basic and 9 annual ordering periods) Firm-Fixed Price/Time and Materials, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity IDIQ) contract with contract award in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15 no later than 30 Sep 2005.    NOTE:  THIS MARKET SURVEY SUPERCEDES PIXS SYNOPSIS 03R0009W (SOLICITATION #F33657-03-R-0009), WHICH WAS  PUBLISHED ON 28 Mar 03.  OUR ORIGINAL REQUIREMENT HAS  CHANGES; WE WILL BE ACQUIRING CONTRACTOR OPERATED MANAGED  BASE SUPPLY (COMBS) ONLY.  AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE SERVICE  WILL NO LONGER BE INCLUDED ON THIS ACTION.   T-6A Background The T-6A is a derivative of the Swiss Pilatus PC-9 MK II, which  uses Non-Developmental Items (NDI) or derivatives of  commercially available items to meet most system requirements.   The   T-6A was missionized by Raytheon Aircraft Company  (RAC), Wichita, Kansas to replace the United States Air Force  (USAF) T-37B and the United States Navy (USN) T-34C primary  training aircraft.  Raytheon owns the data rights to the T-6A  design and all peculiar support equipment.  The T-6A is a low  wing, high performance, pressurized, turboprop aerobatic trainer.   The T-6A will provide entry-level students with the skills  necessary for contact/familiarization, instruments, formation, and  navigation during both day and night conditions.   T-6A training  will lead to a level of proficiency that permits transition into one  of the USAF or USN advanced pilot training tracks.   Current Environment There are presently 143 T-6As stationed at four main operating  bases (MOB):  Randolph AFB, Texas; Moody AFB, Georgia;  Laughlin AFB, Texas; and Naval Air Station (NAS) Pensacola,  Florida.  At the end of this 10-year CLS follow-on support  contract (through FY 2015), there will be a total of 782 aircraft in  the field stationed at these four MOBs and these additional bases:  Sheppard AFB, Texas; Vance AFB, Oklahoma; and Columbus  AFB, Mississippi; NAS Whiting, Florida; and NAS Corpus  Christi, Texas.   Currently, approximately 18% of the fleet has been delivered and  the production line is scheduled to continue through FY 2015 with  the production of 40-70 aircraft per year.  In addition, the USAF  anticipates approximately 30 Class I Engineering Change  Proposals through FY 2012 that will involve (but are not limited  to) both the airframe structural components (e.g., landing gear)  and avionics subsystems.  Attached is a list of some of the tasks in  the execution or planning stages that will affect the upcoming  CLS requirement. At this time, Raytheon Aircraft Company (RAC) provides both  the T-6A production and CLS COMBS functions for this program.   Presently, there are 4,000 line items that need to be managed; this  figure may change as engineering changes are accomplished to the  aircraft.

THIS IS AN INVITATION FOR INDUSTRY TO MEET WITH THE GOVERNMENT. The Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) Aircraft Program, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is conducting an additional market survey for the follow-on Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) of the T-6A Texan II aircraft.  We anticipate at most a  10-year (9 month basic and 9 annual ordering periods) Firm-Fixed Price/Time and Materials, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity IDIQ) contract with contract award in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15 no later than 30 Sep 2005.    NOTE:  THIS MARKET SURVEY SUPERCEDES PIXS SYNOPSIS 03R0009W (SOLICITATION #F33657-03-R-0009), WHICH WAS  PUBLISHED ON 28 Mar 03.  OUR ORIGINAL REQUIREMENT HAS  CHANGES; WE WILL BE ACQUIRING CONTRACTOR OPERATED MANAGED  BASE SUPPLY (COMBS) ONLY.  AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE SERVICE  WILL NO LONGER BE INCLUDED ON THIS ACTION.   T-6A Background The T-6A is a derivative of the Swiss Pilatus PC-9 MK II, which  uses Non-Developmental Items (NDI) or derivatives of  commercially available items to meet most system requirements.   The   T-6A was missionized by Raytheon Aircraft Company  (RAC), Wichita, Kansas to replace the United States Air Force  (USAF) T-37B and the United States Navy (USN) T-34C primary  training aircraft.  Raytheon owns the data rights to the T-6A  design and all peculiar support equipment.  The T-6A is a low  wing, high performance, pressurized, turboprop aerobatic trainer.   The T-6A will provide entry-level students with the skills  necessary for contact/familiarization, instruments, formation, and  navigation during both day and night conditions.   T-6A training  will lead to a level of proficiency that permits transition into one  of the USAF or USN advanced pilot training tracks.   Current Environment There are presently 143 T-6As stationed at four main operating  bases (MOB):  Randolph AFB, Texas; Moody AFB, Georgia;  Laughlin AFB, Texas; and Naval Air Station (NAS) Pensacola,  Florida.  At the end of this 10-year CLS follow-on support  contract (through FY 2015), there will be a total of 782 aircraft in  the field stationed at these four MOBs and these additional bases:  Sheppard AFB, Texas; Vance AFB, Oklahoma; and Columbus  AFB, Mississippi; NAS Whiting, Florida; and NAS Corpus  Christi, Texas.   Currently, approximately 18% of the fleet has been delivered and  the production line is scheduled to continue through FY 2015 with  the production of 40-70 aircraft per year.  In addition, the USAF  anticipates approximately 30 Class I Engineering Change  Proposals through FY 2012 that will involve (but are not limited  to) both the airframe structural components (e.g., landing gear)  and avionics subsystems.

T-6A Background The T-6A is a derivative of the Swiss Pilatus PC-9 MK II, which  uses Non-Developmental Items (NDI) or derivatives of  commercially available items to meet most system requirements.   The   T-6A was missionized by Raytheon Aircraft Company  (RAC), Wichita, Kansas to replace the United States Air Force  (USAF) T-37B and the United States Navy (USN) T-34C primary  training aircraft.  Raytheon owns the data rights to the T-6A  design and all peculiar support equipment.  The T-6A is a low  wing, high performance, pressurized, turboprop aerobatic trainer.   The T-6A will provide entry-level students with the skills  necessary for contact/familiarization, instruments, formation, and  navigation during both day and night conditions.   T-6A training  will lead to a level of proficiency that permits transition into one  of the USAF or USN advanced pilot training tracks.   Current Environment There are presently 143 T-6As stationed at four main operating  bases (MOB):  Randolph AFB, Texas; Moody AFB, Georgia;  Laughlin AFB, Texas; and Naval Air Station (NAS) Pensacola,  Florida.  At the end of this 10-year CLS follow-on support  contract (through FY 2015), there will be a total of 782 aircraft in  the field stationed at these four MOBs and these additional bases:  Sheppard AFB, Texas; Vance AFB, Oklahoma; and Columbus  AFB, Mississippi; NAS Whiting, Florida; and NAS Corpus  Christi, Texas.   Currently, approximately 18% of the fleet has been delivered and  the production line is scheduled to continue through FY 2015 with  the production of 40-70 aircraft per year.  In addition, the USAF  anticipates approximately 30 Class I Engineering Change  Proposals through FY 2012 that will involve (but are not limited  to) both the airframe structural components (e.g., landing gear)  and avionics subsystems.  Attached is a list of some of the tasks in  the execution or planning stages that will affect the upcoming  CLS requirement. At this time, Raytheon Aircraft Company (RAC) provides both  the T-6A production and CLS COMBS functions for this program.   Presently, there are 4,000 line items that need to be managed; this  figure may change as engineering changes are accomplished to the  aircraft.  If the awardee of this contract is other than the  incumbent, the Government would require the establishment of an  Associate Contractor Agreement (ACA) with the aircraft  manufacture/ sustaining engineering contractor (Raytheon Aircraft  Company, Wichita KS) and major subsystem contractors for  avionics, engines, etc.  Approximately 60% of the dollar value of  spare parts is controlled by RAC proprietary drawings and designs  which only specific suppliers are licensed to manufacturer.  In  addition, all aircraft parts are required to be manufactured and  repaired under Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certified  processes to maintain airworthiness certification for military use. Follow-On Contract Description The CLS follow-on contract will procure COMBS support in  accordance with FAR 15 for the   T-6A aircraft at 11 Air Force  and Navy sites.  The contractor shall establish, operate and  manage a COMBS at each operating base providing a range and  depth (contractor determined) of spare parts/bench stock including  parts for off-equipment/I-Level backshops, spare engines, engine  Quick Engine Change (QEC) kits, engine modular components,  repair parts, peculiar (special) hand tools, support equipment (SE)  and expendables (including aircraft and SE bench stock) necessary  to support the assigned JPATS aircraft at the specified utilization  rate.  The contractor will ensure that all COMBS components are  FAA certified in accordance with FAA (Federal Aviation  Administration) Part 23.  The contractor shall ensure that all spare  parts are configured, painted and balanced (if required) for  immediate installation on JPATS aircraft in accordance with the  approved government technical data.  The contractor shall ensure  that all items with shelf-life restrictions are maintained within items  allowable limitations and tolerances.  No JPATS aircraft  component repair/maintenance shall be accomplished in the  COMBS.  The contractor shall only store JPATS aircraft parts,  TCTO kits and SE in the COMBS.  The contractor shall maintain  data outlining required protective packaging and transportation  requirements (electrostatic discharge sensitive items, fragile items,  hazardous materials, etc) for contractor furnished spare parts and  SE subject to special packaging requirements. The contractor shall support the bases’ daily flight operations and  any OPLAN, exercise, deployment, static display, fly-by,  incentive flight or open house that involves JPATS aircraft or  COMBS.  The contractor shall have spare parts and expendables  (not maintained in bench stock) available for the operating  command within 30 minutes after receipt of a valid demand on the  COMBS during normal duty hours and 30 minutes after arrival at  the base when on-call.  In addition, the contractor will ensure  housekeeping is performed in the COMBS facility. The COMBS contractor will be expected to maintain a current  COMBS spare inventory.  As     T-6A configuration changes are  accomplished on the production line, the COMBS contractor will  update COMBS inventory as appropriate. The COMBS contractor will be expected to provide all support  equipment required to operate and maintain the T-6A.  A list will  be provided in any request for proposal. The COMBS contractor will be expected to perform or  subcontract off-site Intermediate and Depot level repair of failed  reparable components.  A list of historical failure rates and the  CAGE code of the manufacturer will be provided in any request  for proposal. The COMBS contractor will be expected to provide their own  office equipment, phones, phone service, furniture, material  handling equipment, etc., required to operate the COMBS. The COMBS contractor will be expected to manage hazardous  material IAW current Federal, State and Base regulations.  T6-A  hazardous materials are limited to paints/solvents, oils/greases and  explosive components of the escape system. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL  SUBMISSION.

OUR ORIGINAL REQUIREMENT HAS  CHANGES; WE WILL BE ACQUIRING CONTRACTOR OPERATED MANAGED  BASE SUPPLY (COMBS) ONLY.  AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE SERVICE  WILL NO LONGER BE INCLUDED ON THIS ACTION.   T-6A Background The T-6A is a derivative of the Swiss Pilatus PC-9 MK II, which  uses Non-Developmental Items (NDI) or derivatives of  commercially available items to meet most system requirements.   The   T-6A was missionized by Raytheon Aircraft Company  (RAC), Wichita, Kansas to replace the United States Air Force  (USAF) T-37B and the United States Navy (USN) T-34C primary  training aircraft.  Raytheon owns the data rights to the T-6A  design and all peculiar support equipment.  The T-6A is a low  wing, high performance, pressurized, turboprop aerobatic trainer.   The T-6A will provide entry-level students with the skills  necessary for contact/familiarization, instruments, formation, and  navigation during both day and night conditions.   T-6A training  will lead to a level of proficiency that permits transition into one  of the USAF or USN advanced pilot training tracks.   Current Environment There are presently 143 T-6As stationed at four main operating  bases (MOB):  Randolph AFB, Texas; Moody AFB, Georgia;  Laughlin AFB, Texas; and Naval Air Station (NAS) Pensacola,  Florida.  At the end of this 10-year CLS follow-on support  contract (through FY 2015), there will be a total of 782 aircraft in  the field stationed at these four MOBs and these additional bases:  Sheppard AFB, Texas; Vance AFB, Oklahoma; and Columbus  AFB, Mississippi; NAS Whiting, Florida; and NAS Corpus  Christi, Texas.   Currently, approximately 18% of the fleet has been delivered and  the production line is scheduled to continue through FY 2015 with  the production of 40-70 aircraft per year.  In addition, the USAF  anticipates approximately 30 Class I Engineering Change  Proposals through FY 2012 that will involve (but are not limited  to) both the airframe structural components (e.g., landing gear)  and avionics subsystems.

<DESC>UPDATE, 1 OCT 04:  Previously, it was adviced that ORCA would become mandatory on 1 Oct 04.  However, the FAR final rule has not been published and no release date has been given.  If ORCA becomes effective after the RFP is on the street, the solicitation would be amended to add the ORCA requirement. UPDATE, 30 SEP 04:  Three attachments have been posted below.  These are: The Government briefing from the Industry Meetings held 23 Aug - 15 Sep 04, questions and answers (with Government comments)resulting from the meetings, and an updated acquistion schedule (Attachment 2). UPDATE, 1 SEP 04:  In the near future there will be a change to the FAR to  implement the On-Line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).  The "Open FAR Cases" report shows that the FAR final rule is being reviewed  byOMB, and after that review is complete the final rule will be issued. ORCA will become mandatory on 1 OCT 2004. ORCA will be a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the  collection of FAR level certs and reps on-line.  Potential offerors/ bidders will need to complete certs and reps online at least annually.   Contractors who already are registered in the Central Contractor  Registration (CCR) can get a head start by going to http://www.bpn.gov/orca  to activate their ORCA profiles. Any information specific to the JPATS COMBS Services RFP above and beyond  what ORCA entails will be included in the RFP. NOTE:  A NEW ATTACHMENT HAS BEEN ADDED AT THE END OF THIS  SYNOPSIS.

<DESC>UPDATE, 12 JAN 05:  The final RFP is hereby released.  Also attached are the Acquisition Schedule and 2 PCO letters (Source Selection  Notification and Request for Proposal).  Please note Shannon Prince is no longer a POC for this effort.  The current POCs are:  Cheryle Lankford (937-904-4197), Capt. Jason Ortiz (937-904-4609) and Trini Rendon (937-904-4286). UPDATE, 3 JAN 05:  Regarding the Draft RFP posted 30 Dec 04, please be advised that the updated DRAFT RFP has a potential for up to a 10  year period of performance as opposed to the original 5 year period of performance.  All comments/questions to the current Draft RFP  should be received no later than 12:00 EST on 10 Jan 05.  The  Government may not respond with direct answers but may incorporate  comments into the Final RFP. UPDATE, 30 DEC 04:  The T-6 COMBS Services acquisition webpage has been updated to include the Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP) in response to the questions/comments to the DRFP posted 3 Nov 04.  Only documents with changes/updates are posted.  This includes the updated DRFP, Section L and Section M.  Blue change bars highlight changes made.  A document entitled "Industry Questions and Responses, 30 Dec 04" has also been posted.  Questions can be directed to Cheryle Lankford, 937-904-4197, or Capt. Jason Ortiz, 937-904-4609.  UPDATE, 24 NOV 04:  Our e-mail system went down November 12 and was out not fixed until sometime the following week.  As a result, some e-mail  was lost.  If you sent an e-mail responding to the draft RFP during that  time, it may not have been received.  If an e-mail was sent and you did not receive any response from our office advising receipt of the e-mail, please resubmit.  We apologize for any inconvenience. UPDATE, 4 NOV 04:  The files posted 3 Nov 04 for Attachment 2 (MESL) and  Attachment 3 (MESM)were incorrect as the titles had been erroneously  switched for the files.  These files have been deleted and the correct files have been reposted with a 4 Nov 04 date. UPDATE, 3 NOV 04:  The T-6 COMBS Services acquisition webpage has been updated to include a Draft Request for Proposal (DRFP).  Please review the document in its entirety and submit comments and/or questions to the Contract Specialist cited therein no later than close of business 19 Nov  2004.  Comments may be submitted electronically.  If mailed, they must be  postmarked by close of business 19 Nov 2004. Please note that there has been one slight update to the Government  requirement.  In addition to the previously identified locations requiring COMBS Services support, the Government has updated the DRFP to now also include T-6 Modification Line or any other depot level repair location as part of the requirement.  The T-6 Modification Line is currently located at the Raytheon Aircraft Facility in Wichita, KS.  The requirement involves providing safety of flight parts support for aircraft on the mod line that have component failure unrelated to work performed at that location. UPDATE, 1 OCT 04:  Previously, it was adviced that ORCA would become  mandatory on 1 Oct 04.  However, the FAR final rule has not been published and no release date has been given.  If ORCA becomes effective after the RFP is on the street, the solicitation would be amended to add the ORCA requirement. UPDATE, 30 SEP 04:  Three attachments have been posted below.  These are: The Government briefing from the Industry Meetings held 23 Aug - 15 Sep 04, questions and answers (with Government comments)resulting from the meetings, and an updated acquistion schedule (Attachment 2). UPDATE, 1 SEP 04:  In the near future there will be a change to the FAR to  implement the On-Line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).  The "Open FAR Cases" report shows that the FAR final rule is being reviewed  byOMB, and after that review is complete the final rule will be issued. ORCA will become mandatory on 1 OCT 2004. ORCA will be a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the  colleces RFP above and beyond  what ORCA entails will be included in the RFP. NOTE:  A NEW ATTACHMENT HAS BEEN ADDED AT THE END OF THIS  SYNOPSIS.  THIS IS AN INVITATION FOR INDUSTRY TO MEET WITH THE GOVERNMENT. The Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) Aircraft Program, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is conducting an additional market survey for the follow-on Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) of the T-6A Texan II aircraft.  We anticipate at most a  10-year (9 month basic and 9 annual ordering periods) Firm-Fixed Price/Time and Materials, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity IDIQ) contract with contract award in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15 no later than 30 Sep 2005.    NOTE:  THIS MARKET SURVEY SUPERCEDES PIXS SYNOPSIS 03R0009W (SOLICITATION #F33657-03-R-0009), WHICH WAS  PUBLISHED ON 28 Mar 03.  OUR ORIGINAL REQUIREMENT HAS  CHANGES; WE WILL BE ACQUIRING CONTRACTOR OPERATED MANAGED  BASE SUPPLY (COMBS) ONLY.  AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE SERVICE  WILL NO LONGER BE INCLUDED ON THIS ACTION.   T-6A Background The T-6A is a derivative of the Swiss Pilatus PC-9 MK II, which  uses Non-Developmental Items (NDI) or derivatives of  commercially available items to meet most system requirements.   The   T-6A was missionized by Raytheon Aircraft Company  (RAC), Wichita, Kansas to replace the United States Air Force  (USAF) T-37B and the United States Navy (USN) T-34C primary  training aircraft.  Raytheon owns the data rights to the T-6A  design and all peculiar support equipment.  The T-6A is a low  wing, high performance, pressurized, turboprop aerobatic trainer.   The T-6A will provide entry-level students with the skills  necessary for contact/familiarization, instruments, formation, and  navigation during both day and night conditions.   T-6A training  will lead to a level of proficiency that permits transition into one  of the USAF or USN advanced pilot training tracks.   Current Environment There are presently 143 T-6As stationed at four main operating  bases (MOB):  Randolph AFB, Texas; Moody AFB, Georgia;  Laughlin AFB, Texas; and Naval Air Station (NAS) Pensacola,  Florida.  At the end of this 10-year CLS follow-on support  contract (through FY 2015), there will be a total of 782 aircraft in  the field stationed at these four MOBs and these additional bases:  Sheppard AFB, Texas; Vance AFB, Oklahoma; and Columbus  AFB, Mississippi; NAS Whiting, Florida; and NAS Corpus  Christi, Texas.   Currently, approximately 18% of the fleet has been delivered and  the production line is scheduled to continue through FY 2015 with  the production of 40-70 aircraft per year.  In addition, the USAF  anticipates approximately 30 Class I Engineering Change  Proposals through FY 2012 that will involve (but are not limited  to) both the airframe structural components (e.g., landing gear)  and avionics subsystems.  Attached is a list of some of the tasks in  the execution or planning stages that will affect the upcoming  CLS requirement. At this time, Raytheon Aircraft Company (RAC) provides both  the T-6A production and CLS COMBS functions for this program.   Presently, there are 4,000 line items that need to be managed; this  figure may change as engineering changes are accomplished to the  aircraft.  If the awardee of this contract is other than the  incumbent, the Government would require the establishment of an  Associate Contractor Agreement (ACA) with the aircraft  manufacture/ sustaining engineering contractor (Raytheon Aircraft  Company, Wichita KS) and major subsystem contractors for  avionics, engines, etc.  Approximately 60% of the dollar value of  spare parts is controlled by RAC proprietary drawings and designs  which only specific suppliers are licensed to manufacturer.  In  addition, all aircraft parts are required to be manufactured and  repaired under Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certified  processes to maintain airworthiness certification for military use. Follow-On Contract Description The CLS follow-on contract will procure COMBS support in  accordance with FAR 15 for the   T-6A aircraft at 11 Air Force  and Navy sites.  The contractor shall establish, operate and  manage a COMBS at each operating base providing a range and  depth (contractor determined) of spare parts/bench stock including  parts for off-equipment/I-Level backshops, spare engines, engine  Quick Engine Change (QEC) kits, engine modular components,  repair parts, peculiar (special) hand tools, support equipment (SE)  and expendables (including aircraft and SE bench stock) necessary  to support the assigned JPATS aircraft at the specified utilization  rate.  The contractor will ensure that all COMBS components are  FAA certified in accordance with FAA (Federal Aviation  Administration) Part 23.  The contractor shall ensure that all spare  parts are configured, painted and balanced (if required) for  immediate installation on JPATS aircraft in accordance with the  approved government technical data.  The contractor shall ensure  that all items with shelf-life restrictions are maintained within items  allowable limitations and tolerances.  No JPATS aircraft  component repair/maintenance shall be accomplished in the  COMBS.  The contractor shall only store JPATS aircraft parts,  TCTO kits and SE in the COMBS.  The contractor shall maintain  data outlining required protective packaging and transportation  requirements (electrostatic discharge sensitive items, fragile items,  hazardous materials, etc) for contractor furnished spare parts and  SE subject to special packaging requirements. The contractor shall support the bases’ daily flight operations and  any OPLAN, exercise, deployment, static display, fly-by,  incentive flight or open house that involves JPATS aircraft or  COMBS.  The contractor shall have spare parts and expendables  (not maintained in bench stock) available for the operating  command within 30 minutes after receipt of a valid demand on the  COMBS during normal duty hours and 30 minutes after arrival at  the base when on-call.  In addition, the contractor will ensure  housekeeping is performed in the COMBS facility. The COMBS contractor will be expected to maintain a current  COMBS spare inventory.  As     T-6A configuration changes are  accomplished on the production line, the COMBS contractor will  update COMBS inventory as appropriate. The COMBS contractor will be expected to provide all support  equipment required to operate and maintain the T-6A.  A list will  be provided in any request for proposal. The COMBS contractor will be expected to perform or  subcontract off-site Intermediate and Depot level repair of failed  reparable components.  A list of historical failure rates and the  CAGE code of the manufacturer will be provided in any request  for proposal. The COMBS contractor will be expected to provide their own  office equipment, phones, phone service, furniture, material  handling equipment, etc., required to operate the COMBS. The COMBS contractor will be expected to manage hazardous  material IAW current Federal, State and Base regulations.  T6-A  hazardous materials are limited to paints/solvents, oils/greases and  explosive components of the escape system. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL  SUBMISSION.  It is a market research tool to determine the  availability and capability of potential sources.  Firms responding  to this announcement should indicate whether they are a large or  small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned  small business, HUBZone small business and/or service disabled  veteran-owned small business.  The North American Industrial  Classification System (NAICS) Code 336411, Aircraft  Manufacturing, applies to this acquisition with a size standard of  1,500 employees.  All prospective contractors must be registered  in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database to be  awarded a DoD contract.

<SUBJECT>A--REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)/ SOURCES SOUGHT (SS) NOTICE LIGHTWEIGHT TRANSPORTABLE SATCOM ANTENNA SYSTEM AMENDMENT
<SOLNBR>W15P7T-06-R-P016
<RESPDATE>020306
<ARCHDATE>04042006
<CONTACT>David Nostrant, 732-532-8388
<DESC>The purpose of this amendment to the RFI is to extend the date of submissions by 1 week from 27 January 2006 to 03 February 2006. REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)/ SOURCES SOUGHT (SS) NOTICE LIGHTWEIGHT TRANSPORTABLE SATCOM ANTENNA SYSTEM THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) AND NOT A SOLICITATION. The US Army Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM), Communications Ele ctronics Research, Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC), Space and Terrestrial Communication Direct orate (S&TCD) is requesting information from companies that have design/development experience in antenna systems and/or power amplifiers for vehicle -mounted Satellite Communication (SATCOM) systems in the X, Ku, Ka and Q bands. The Government wishes to de termine potential sources for the development of an affordable, lightweight Comm-On-the-Halt (COTH) multiband antenna system for tactical satellite communications.       INTRODUCTION: It is desired that next-generation multiband, transportable COTH antenna systems operate with an increased data rate, while being lighter in weight and potentially smaller than currently fielded systems.     Ease of use and setup are also highly     desired qualities.     This antenna system should be capable of transmitting and receiving via multiple commercial and military satellite systems, including the Wideband Gapfiller Satellite (WGS), commercial Ku Band systems, X TAR, Advanced EHF (AEHF), and Tr ansformational Satellites (TSAT).     If easily accommodated, commercial Ka Band systems may also be of interest.     Simultaneous links to more than one satellite are not required.       The Government is requesting inform ation from Industry to aid in determining the maturity of key technologies to meet these requirements.     It is understood that novel or alternative approaches to the problem may be needed to meet the desired objectives.     P ossible alternative approach es could include, but are not limited to:     shaped dual reflector systems for increased aperture efficiency, bifocal reflectors with two multiband feeds to eliminate manual feed changes, and the incorporation of an additional agi le scan capability (eith er electronic or mechanical) with limited field of view to assist with antenna pointing.     This information will assist the Government in formulating an acquisition strategy and associated timeline for development of a future antenna     program.     The  Government plans to start development of a multiband antenna system in FY07, with an OTM demonstration on Army representative vehicles in FY08 to validate a Technical Readiness Level (TRL) 6.     Key areas of interest for this antenna system in clude TWT (Traveling Wave Tube) amplifiers size/power and reliability.     SCOPE: The purpose of this RFI is to gather information to support a possible RFP release for a multiband COTH SATCOM TWT amplifiers, and to determine Industry interest in participating in th is effort. The Government will use the information gathered in re sponse to this RFI to gain an understanding of potential approaches to meet COTH SATCOM TWT amplifier requirements. We seek to understand the current state of development that companies have  achieved in TWT amplifier designs, as well as various alternative     innovative and creative solutions, and how these might apply to the Government effort to achieve a lightweight, affordable, efficient COTH antenna system to potentially replace the HC3 COTH Phoenix. DATA SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: Key areas of interest for this antenna system and amplifiers include the following items.     Please address as many of the following as possible in your Information package:     1.        Statement of interest, either as a Prime- or a Sub-contractor/partner/team member.     2.

<DESC>Amendment 0002 has been issued to extend the required response date from 16 Jan 2006 12.00hrs am to 27 Jan 2006 12.00hrs pm. Questions and Answers as provided below has been added to this rfq a. The ratio of supervisory staff to student interns is in consistent with what we have done for the past two years. Previously we have had one supervisor for every 20 interns. Using this ratio, for 400 students we would need 20 supervisors. This ratio has been very effective in terms of managing programs and hand ling and/or preventing problems. Previous intern contracts have been 150 interns - 8 supervisors, 60 interns - 3 supervisors, 30 interns -2 supervisors. Ans: (The quantity of 15 could be changed to 20.) It is important to note that supervisors do get sick and and when that is the case, the situation needs to be managable. For example, with 50 student interns and only two supervisors, if one supervisor gets sick, the other one can't manage 50 interns alone. Also, we want to retain our superviosrs for the dur ation of 13 weeks or longer, and burnout is a factor when they supervise more than 20 college students. We have found the 1/20 ratio to be managable, with more reliability and consistency for Army. b. We really need 60 days (8 weeks) advance notice of depa rture dates and locations as in prior contracts, not 45 days. We are willing to try to put student interns in the field with less lead time, as we have done in the past. Ans: (60 Days of advance notice unless Contractor can do in less by mutual agreement) c. Regarding airline tickets, it will be helpful if additional information can be given here, e.g. a rough estimate of dates, numbers, locations. This would assist us in estimating varying costs for different locations, and high/low season costs. Ans: (The re is no way that we can know this because of the uncertainty in this program that is why we set up the contract as a requirement contract.) d. Is there a commitment of a minimum number of student interns each year, e.g. 200 of the 400. We would need a min imum number in order to be able to commit the financial resources to put a structure in place for implementation purposes. For example, recruiting costs, hiring staff to screen and process interns, advertisements and so on. Ans: (We anticipate 150 Interns. ) e. Can you tell us the approximate number of student interns who will be affiliated with the Operation Purple Camp. Also, we want to confirm that student interns working with Operation Purple, as defined in this statement of work, are working under the d irection of Army staff and they are not designated to manage the effort. Ans: (Approximately 21 Interns and there will be a Camp Director (CYS)on loction.) f. It is our understanding that this document for 400 student interns does not include the roughly 1 50 Camp Adventure student interns who provide summer programs, contracted for separately with Army installations in Germany and Italy. Ans: (Correct)

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis. The purpose is to obtain information about market information or capabilities for planning purposes. This is not a request for competitive proposals; therefore, responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. The Government will use the information gathered in response to this document to refine acquisition strategy for the Instruments Commodity Council. The Instrument Commodity Council contemplates negotiating a performance based logistic support services contract to support the repair of the B-1B Flight Controls and CADC.  It is anticipated that this will be a firm fixed price contract based on flying hours. The Government anticipates negotiating on a sole source basis with Honeywell Inc as they have rights to the drawings for the items to be repaired.  This effort is currently being accomplished as organic repair in the OC-ALC Depot Maintenance Shops. Honeywell will be entering into an agreement with the OC-ALC Depot Maintenance Shops to complete the effort. It is anticipated that Honeywell will be providing the total logistics support efforts.

The new pass will be valid for entry at Federal recreation sites that charge entrance or standard amenity fees.  The new pass is scheduled to be introduced in 2007, and will replace existing recreation pass programs (Golden Eagle, Golden Age, and Golden Access Passports and the National Parks Pass).  For information on existing pass programs, visit http://www.recreation.gov/recpass.cfm.   The US Department of Interior, through its Franchise Fund activity GovWorks on behalf of the US Department of Interior (acting through the Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Reclamation, Fish and Wildlife Service, and National Park Service) and US Department of Agriculture (acting through the US Forest Service) is issuing the attached draft Statement of Work for the pass design and manufacturing; pass sales; fulfillment; customer care; third party sales and fulfillment; financial & inventory management and accountability; management reporting; marketing and communications; and implementation of a new Federal Recreational Lands Pass. Since this is a new requirement for the pass, the Government is striving to include public comment as feasible as possible throughout the acquisition process.  The draft Statement of Work (SOW) is being issued solely for the purpose of obtaining industry comment.  This does not constitute a Request for Proposal.  The Government is anticipating competing this requirement on a full and open, unrestricted basis under FAR Part 15.  The purpose of this draft is to afford industry an opportunity to comment on best practices and critical elements that should be included in the SOW.  Any comments provided should not be viewed as a vehicle for presenting a specific approach or product intended to be proposed, but as an opportunity to improve an eventual solicitation package. The Government has prepared a draft SOW to describe its requirement in detail with specifications for fulfilling this requirement.  The Government is in the process of finalizing the SOW and attempting to  minimize questions prior to the release of the Request for Proposal.  The Government is seeking public comment on the following questions: 1.	Has the Government described the requirement in a clear concise manner?  Can you suggest specific changes to improve the clarity of the draft SOW? 2.	Are there other approaches that might be more suitable for the tasks described? 3.	Has the Government allowed for future innovation or technological change? 4.	Are there additional data, statistics, or information needed to submit a complete proposal? 5.	Does the draft SOW contain oversights that would prevent vendors from fulfilling the requirement for the new pass? 6.	The Government is considering a negotiated IDIQ firm-fixed price contract with the price per pass.  Is this the best contract type and pricing structure for this requirement?  The Government welcomes suggestions regarding a pricing structure for this requirement. 7.	What types of incentives might be appropriate for this requirement?  To what extent could this requirement be performance-based? 8.	Can you provide any other recommendations, comments or suggestions? Comments, whether supportive or critical, are earnestly solicited regarding every aspect of this requirement.  Replies are not mandatory.  Replies will be separated from, and have no bearing on, subsequent evaluations of proposals submitted in response to any resulting formal Request for Proposals.  The use of comments received from industry to complete final Statements of Work and resulting solicitation documents will be at the discretion of the Government.  Any subsequent solicitation will be synopsized prior to its release.  Eligibility in participating in a future acquisition does not depend upon a response to this notice.  The Government will not critique a potential offeror's comments and this notice should not be used by offerors to market their products/services.  The Government does not intend to pay for the information solicited and will not recognize any costs associated with the response.  Proprietary information is not being solicited.  Information considered proprietary, if any, should be identified as such.

<DESC>The Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) Aircraft Program, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is conducting an additional market survey for the follow-on Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) of the T-6A Texan II aircraft.  We anticipate at most a  10-year (9 month basic and 9 annual ordering periods) Firm-Fixed Price/Time and Materials, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity IDIQ) contract with contract award in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15 no later than 30 Sep 2005.    NOTE:  THIS MARKET SURVEY SUPERCEDES PIXS SYNOPSIS 03R0009W (SOLICITATION #F33657-03-R-0009), WHICH WAS  PUBLISHED ON 28 Mar 03.  OUR ORIGINAL REQUIREMENT HAS  CHANGES; WE WILL BE ACQUIRING CONTRACTOR OPERATED MANAGED  BASE SUPPLY (COMBS) ONLY.  AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE SERVICE  WILL NO LONGER BE INCLUDED ON THIS ACTION.   T-6A Background The T-6A is a derivative of the Swiss Pilatus PC-9 MK II, which  uses Non-Developmental Items (NDI) or derivatives of  commercially available items to meet most system requirements.   The   T-6A was missionized by Raytheon Aircraft Company  (RAC), Wichita, Kansas to replace the United States Air Force  (USAF) T-37B and the United States Navy (USN) T-34C primary  training aircraft.  Raytheon owns the data rights to the T-6A  design and all peculiar support equipment.  The T-6A is a low  wing, high performance, pressurized, turboprop aerobatic trainer.   The T-6A will provide entry-level students with the skills  necessary for contact/familiarization, instruments, formation, and  navigation during both day and night conditions.   T-6A training  will lead to a level of proficiency that permits transition into one  of the USAF or USN advanced pilot training tracks.   Current Environment There are presently 143 T-6As stationed at four main operating  bases (MOB):  Randolph AFB, Texas; Moody AFB, Georgia;  Laughlin AFB, Texas; and Naval Air Station (NAS) Pensacola,  Florida.  At the end of this 10-year CLS follow-on support  contract (through FY 2015), there will be a total of 782 aircraft in  the field stationed at these four MOBs and these additional bases:  Sheppard AFB, Texas; Vance AFB, Oklahoma; and Columbus  AFB, Mississippi; NAS Whiting, Florida; and NAS Corpus  Christi, Texas.   Currently, approximately 18% of the fleet has been delivered and  the production line is scheduled to continue through FY 2015 with  the production of 40-70 aircraft per year.  In addition, the USAF  anticipates approximately 30 Class I Engineering Change  Proposals through FY 2012 that will involve (but are not limited  to) both the airframe structural components (e.g., landing gear)  and avionics subsystems.  Attached is a list of some of the tasks in  the execution or planning stages that will affect the upcoming  CLS requirement. At this time, Raytheon Aircraft Company (RAC) provides both  the T-6A production and CLS COMBS functions for this program.   Presently, there are 4,000 line items that need to be managed; this  figure may change as engineering changes are accomplished to the  aircraft.  If the awardee of this contract is other than the  incumbent, the Government would require the establishment of an  Associate Contractor Agreement (ACA) with the aircraft  manufacture/ sustaining engineering contractor (Raytheon Aircraft  Company, Wichita KS) and major subsystem contractors for  avionics, engines, etc.  Approximately 60% of the dollar value of  spare parts is controlled by RAC proprietary drawings and designs  which only specific suppliers are licensed to manufacturer.  In  addition, all aircraft parts are required to be manufactured and  repaired under Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certified  processes to maintain airworthiness certification for military use. Follow-On Contract Description The CLS follow-on contract will procure COMBS support in  accordance with FAR 15 for the   T-6A aircraft at 11 Air Force  and Navy sites.  The contractor shall establish, operate and  manage a COMBS at each operating base providing a range and  depth (contractor determined) of spare parts/bench stock including  parts for off-equipment/I-Level backshops, spare engines, engine  Quick Engine Change (QEC) kits, engine modular components,  repair parts, peculiar (special) hand tools, support equipment (SE)  and expendables (including aircraft and SE bench stock) necessary  to support the assigned JPATS aircraft at the specified utilization  rate.  The contractor will ensure that all COMBS components are  FAA certified in accordance with FAA (Federal Aviation  Administration) Part 23.  The contractor shall ensure that all spare  parts are configured, painted and balanced (if required) for  immediate installation on JPATS aircraft in accordance with the  approved government technical data.  The contractor shall ensure  that all items with shelf-life restrictions are maintained within items  allowable limitations and tolerances.  No JPATS aircraft  component repair/maintenance shall be accomplished in the  COMBS.  The contractor shall only store JPATS aircraft parts,  TCTO kits and SE in the COMBS.  The contractor shall maintain  data outlining required protective packaging and transportation  requirements (electrostatic discharge sensitive items, fragile items,  hazardous materials, etc) for contractor furnished spare parts and  SE subject to special packaging requirements. The contractor shall support the bases’ daily flight operations and  any OPLAN, exercise, deployment, static display, fly-by,  incentive flight or open house that involves JPATS aircraft or  COMBS.  The contractor shall have spare parts and expendables  (not maintained in bench stock) available for the operating  command within 30 minutes after receipt of a valid demand on the  COMBS during normal duty hours and 30 minutes after arrival at  the base when on-call.  In addition, the contractor will ensure  housekeeping is performed in the COMBS facility. The COMBS contractor will be expected to maintain a current  COMBS spare inventory.  As     T-6A configuration changes are  accomplished on the production line, the COMBS contractor will  update COMBS inventory as appropriate. The COMBS contractor will be expected to provide all support  equipment required to operate and maintain the T-6A.  A list will  be provided in any request for proposal. The COMBS contractor will be expected to perform or  subcontract off-site Intermediate and Depot level repair of failed  reparable components.  A list of historical failure rates and the  CAGE code of the manufacturer will be provided in any request  for proposal. The COMBS contractor will be expected to provide their own  office equipment, phones, phone service, furniture, material  handling equipment, etc., required to operate the COMBS. The COMBS contractor will be expected to manage hazardous  material IAW current Federal, State and Base regulations.  T6-A  hazardous materials are limited to paints/solvents, oils/greases and  explosive components of the escape system. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL  SUBMISSION.

<DESC>•	JOINT MUNITIONS EFFECTIVENESS MANUALS (JMEMS). Sources are sought that have capabilities to prepare documents and electronic media products for publication and to conduct special research projects. This procurement will support the Joint Technical Coordinating Group for Munitions Effectiveness (JTCG/ME), a tri-service organization under direction of the Joint Logistics Commanders. Documents/products to be prepared for publication are technical handbooks and special publications. Preparation of these documents/products will require the contractor to: a. perform mathematical computations using existing computer models that have been authenticated and approved by the JTCG/ME, b. perform art and graphics work, c. prepare draft documents, d. edit documents, e. modify computer models, f. develop CD-ROM products that may be used to present data and calculate JMEM effectiveness data electronically, and g. sanitize electronic media products for release to foreign governments. The contractor will also be required to conduct research studies that are related to the publication of the technical handbooks. These research projects are initiated when data voids are discovered during document preparation. Examples of such research projects are: a. battlefield visibility due to smoke and dust; b. weather effects on battlefield visibility, and; c. reliability and maintainability of hydraulic systems on military vehicles. These special studies vary in duration and require experts with advanced degrees in specific fields of research. These fields include Engineering (Aeronautical, Mechanical, Electrical, Civil), Chemistry, Mathematics and Statistics. The research tasks can be carried out at the contractor's facilities when in the best interest of the Government. Since many of the technical handbooks and CD-ROM products are already published, some of the work will consist of preparing revisions and/or updates. It is required that all revisions and/or updates be in the same format and of the same quality as original publications. These technical handbooks present weapon effectiveness data for air delivered and surface delivered weapons. These documents are generally referred to as the Joint Munitions Effectiveness Manuals (JMEMs). The contractor shall be required to install JTCG/ME approved programs on the Government provided computer systems at Eglin AFB and the Aberdeen Proving Grounds, and to verify proper operation of these programs. The contractor may also be required to prepare and document computer models based upon mathematical models provided by the JTCG/ME and in some cases those developed by the munitions contractors. The contractor shall serve as custodian of all JTCG/ME computer models and all master copies of published documents. The contractor will be required to modify documents for release to foreign countries as directed by JTCG/ME. This work will usually require document editing and revising as specified by the appropriate DOD agency. The contractor will be required to prepare presentation aids and instructions to various service schools and agencies on use of technical handbooks and products. The contractor will be required to provide data collection, storage and retrieval services for information that is used in preparation of publications. The majority of this effort deals with revisions, changes, and updates of manuals and products for Surface-to-Surface (JMEM/SS), Air-to-Surface (JMEM/AS), Anti-Air (JMEM/AA), and Target Vulnerability. The major manuals of concern are as follows: 1. Methodology and Evaluation; 2. Reliability; 3. Delivery Accuracy; 4. Helicopter; 5. Small Computers; 6. Systems Characteristics; 7. Target Vulnerability; 8. Target Acquisition; 9. Missile Evaluation; and 10. Gun Evaluation. These manuals are constantly being reviewed, changed and/or revised. The work associated with this project shall be performed at both Eglin AFB, FL and Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD using Government-provided facilities. The analytical function for the JMEM/SS will be accomplished at the Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD facility. The analytical functions for JMEM/AS, JMEM/AA, and Target Vulnerability will be accomplished at the Eglin AFB, FL facility. The publication and graphics support functions will be accomplished at the Eglin AFB, FL facility. Office furniture, office equipment, supplies, utilities, computer support, photographic support, printing support, and special equipment deemed necessary by the Government will be provided by the Government. Historically, there has been a 45-60 man year level of effort required to conduct this work. It is estimated that 60-65 trips (TDYs) away from Eglin AFB and Aberdeen Proving Ground will be required per year. A secret security clearance will be required for all personnel working on this contact. An Organizational Conflict of Interest provision will be included in any resultant contract. It is anticipated the period of performance will be 60 months total to include a basic 36 month period with one 24 month option.

<DESC>The General Services Administration’s Federal Technology Service, Region 5 Chicago, on behalf of the U.S. Air Force Electronic Systems Center (ESC) Forces Protection Squadron, is issuing this Request For Information (RFI) in order to identify companies having the technology, qualification and capabilities to provide Hand Held and Desktop Explosion Detection Equipment for over 200 Air Force installations both Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside the Continental States (OCONUS).  Capabilities/qualifications submitted in response to this RFI will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  Responses will be evaluated for their viability.  The determination of procurement strategy, based upon the responses to this RFI, is solely within the discretion of the government.  All sources may submit a response, which will be considered by the government.  This RFI is for information and planning purposes only.  It does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Furthermore, the Government reserves the right to publish any information provided by a respondent to the RFI if publishing such information is done without attribution (i.e., does not identify the party submitting the response materials), and would not reveal company trade secrets or other similar protected or proprietary information.  For example, if a respondent were to ask when the draft RFP would be released, then such a question could be published without attribution and would not jeopardize any corporate or trade secrets of the respondent.  Accordingly, the Government may publish such materials.  On the other hand, if a respondent were to provide detailed product rollout plans for a new device, then that material would not be published if properly marked.

We invite comments/information on the following:
•	A respondent’s commercial-off-the-shelf product(s) and capability(-ies) to meet the requirements as drafted in the attached technical requirements document.  
•	Whether the above products and capabilities are currently available on an established Government contract (i.e., GSA FSS Schedule).
•	Whether the above products and capabilities are currently available on the open market.
•	Typical pricing structure for Handheld and Desktop Explosive Detection Equipment.  Specifically, what is included in the unit price of the explosive detection device/equipment and what is priced separately?  For example, does the unit price of an explosive detection device/equipment include installation, manuals, training, technical support, upgrades, extended warranties, etc.
•	Client references to other Government Agency POC's with in-depth experience procuring similar devices.
•	Industry Performance Parameters and Measures of Performance/Standards for Handheld and Desktop Explosive Detection Equipment.  Please provide the Government with information and advice regarding recognized Government and/or Industry standards to describe the detailed technical capabilities of handheld and desktop explosives detection equipment.   The Government is especially interested in standards that might be used to describe the capabilities of such equipment generically, using the standard itself as a qualifying parameter for equipment procured, without going into the potentially classified details of the equipment's capabilities.  The Government's intent is to be able to specify the technical requirements of such devices by requiring compliance with a standard (that may itself contain detailed classified information) in a procurement that contains no specifically classified details in either the requirement statement or the resultant proposals. 
•	Security Classifications for Explosive Detection Equipment standards or performance capabilities.
•	Common commercial practices and standards for warranty coverage applicable to Handheld and Desktop Explosive Detection Equipment.  For example, what is and is not covered under the warranty(-ies)?  What is the duration of the warranty period?  Are extended warranties common and available for this equipment?
•	Common commercial practices and standards for preventative maintenance (i.e., How much preventative maintenance for explosive detection equipment is required?  Is this typically carried out end users or under maintenance agreements with the manufacturer or other service provider?).
•	Common commercial practices and standards regarding end user training on the use and maintenance of Handheld and Desktop Explosive Detection Equipment.
•	Management and operations associated with delivery of equipment, quality control, scheduling, training and technical support to include domestic and overseas locations. 
•	Contractor’s and/or potential subcontractors’ status as a small business, veteran owned small business, -HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, women-owned small business.
•	Proprietary Information.  Indicate specifically whether the response includes proprietary information, and which information should be considered proprietary.  Requirements for marking proprietary information are in FAR Subsection 3.104.  Note:  See FAR Subsection 3.104-4 for how this information will be safeguarded, if properly labeled.
This RFI is being issued in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e).  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of the RFI.  Responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of submission of responses to this RFI and the Government’s use of such information.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE AVILABLE. 

This is a Request for Information for Expeditionary Airfield Lighting Future Man Portable Systems.  The USMC Expeditionary Airfield (EAF) Program exists to support a multitude of airfield scenarios throughout the world.  Minimum Operating Strips (MOS), Tactical Landing Zones (TLZ), and Forward Arming and Refueling Points (FARP) are just a few of the Expeditionary Airfield configurations which the program facilitates, and numerous system designs have been employed to accommodate them over the years.  The advent of new technology coupled with lessons learned from a history of previous operational experiences have created a necessity for the acquisition of a new Man Portable airfield lighting system that is small and lightweight with enhanced capability over present systems.

The Man Portable lighting system shall make use of COTS equipment meeting EAF-determined specifications regarding fixture configuration, quantity, output, and intensity to best support the EAF mission.  The system shall not be expected to meet the published specifications of other aviation organizations such as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the North American Treaty Organization (NATO), or the US Air Force (USAF).   

Lighting System Composition

1.  The system shall supply a universal fixture that can support runway edge, taxiway edge, threshold, approach, and lights with flashing capability.  The fixture shall contain light emitting diodes (LED) or other solid state light sources which can produce the colors white, red, green, blue, and infrared (IR) and shall be capable of emitting omni-directional light.  The optical covering, such as a lens or epoxy coating, shall consist of a scratchproof material, so that it may distribute the appropriate amount of light without obstruction.

2.  Power for the fixtures shall be provided using a battery source, and the units shall have the capability to utilize both primary (non-rechargeable) and rechargeable batteries.  The minimum threshold for duration of the light operation shall be 8 hours, but the objective shall be 16 hours.  

3.  Individual lighting fixtures shall be exceptionally lightweight.  Each device, including battery, shall not exceed one pound in weight.

4.  Each fixture shall be considered a consumable item, with the only maintenance action being battery replacement.    

5.  Each fixture shall be capable of being attached to a retrievable base plate.  The base plate shall be capable of mounting to any surface, including but not limited to routine / hard soil, asphalt, rock, coral, concrete, and various types of airfield surfacing systems.

6.  Each fixture shall have the ability to be manually switched, and shall have provisions for a wireless remote control.  This control scheme shall utilize a dedicated remote control, rather than transmitting control signals via other communications equipment.  The minimum threshold range for wireless signal transmission shall be ten meters.  The objective; however, shall be for the remote control scheme to be as capable as possible at traversing terrain.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE AVILABLE. 


This is a Request for Information (RFI) for EXPEDITIONARY AIRFIELD LIGHTING FUTURE SUSTAINMENT SYSTEM.  The USMC Expeditionary Airfield (EAF) Program acts in support of airfield scenarios existing throughout the world.  While Minimum Operating Strips (MOS), Tactical Landing Zones (TLZ), and Forward Arming and Refueling Points (FARP) constitute Expeditionary Airfield configurations that would fall under the realm of a Man-Portable system, all other arrangements will fall under the new Sustainment system.  Sustainment components should be as capable as possible and should not be limited to man-portability.  They must facilitate more robust airfield configurations through the use of more advanced options and accessories for longer durations.  An EAF Sustainment lighting system, with superior capabilities, to support constantly evolving combat scenarios has been called into demand by the arrival of new technology and the learning experiences of those involved in the EAF program

	The EAF Sustainment lighting system shall employ Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) equipment that adheres to the most rigid requirements possible, preferably from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) or International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) published specifications.  Within the realm of Night Vision Device (NVD) operations, there exist no specific published FAA or ICAO guidelines, and therefore, the Sustainment system shall adhere to configuration, quantity, output, and intensity criteria that is EAF-determined to best support the intended mission.  All intentions are for the Sustainment lighting system to meet the most severe published design specifications while being as universally acceptable as possible.  

Lighting System Composition

	1.  The system shall be designed to minimize the number of different light fixtures necessary.  Because there are a myriad of distinct Expeditionary Airfield configurations, each containing a list of separate lighting tasks, it would be difficult for a single fixture to support all necessary roles.  Fixtures, however, should be designed to each facilitate as many of the needed roles as possible.  

	2.  Light sources employed within the lighting fixtures shall consist of light emitting diodes (LED) or other solid state lighting sources capable of producing white, red, green, blue, synchronized white flashing strobe and infrared (IR) light.  Fixtures shall be capable of emitting uni-directional or omni-directional light as appropriate for the application, and all fixtures shall meet minimum intensity requirements specified in the FAA / ICAO publications.   Lights shall be clearly visible during daylight conditions, and the optical covering (such as a lens or epoxy coating) shall consist of a scratchproof material so that it may distribute the appropriate amount of light without obstruction.

	3.  The lighting fixtures shall be capable of drawing power from solar, battery, and hardwire sources, eliminating a single point of failure.  The duration of light operation between battery charging shall be a minimum of 16 hours.  

	4.  Individual light fixtures shall be as lightweight as possible.  Each operational light shall weigh no more than 15 pounds. 

	5.  Sustainment lighting system components shall be maintained through organizational (O) level maintenance.

6.  Each fixture shall be attached using a surface-mounted, retrievable base plate.   The base plate shall be capable of mounting to any surface including, but not limited to, routine / hard soil, asphalt, rock, coral, concrete, and various types of airfield surfacing systems.

	7.  The Sustainment lighting system fixtures shall be capable of manual control as well as ground controlled remote capability.  The wireless control scheme shall utilize a dedicated signal base, rather than transmitting control signals via other communications equipment, such as hand-held radios or cellular phone.
	
8.  The included method of ground controlled remote capability should include an integrated health monitoring system, capable of remotely monitoring various performance parameters of each fixture.  This system should be incorporated into a base control station such as a laptop computer or other capable wireless device.  Such a system should be seen as a design objective rather than a firm threshold.

	9.  Fixtures in the Sustainment lighting system shall provide weatherproofing against harsh conditions to provide constant protection to the batteries and internal circuitry.  The system shall be operational and maintainable in all types of climate and terrain where Marines deploy.  It must be capable of operating during full exposure to temperatures ranging from -25 degrees Fahrenheit (°F) to 125 °F (-30 degrees Celsius (°C) to 51.6 °C).

	10.  A terminal guidance system should be included, and should support NVD operations.  This capability should be treated as a design objective as opposed to a threshold, and systems should utilize LED or solid-state technology.



ONE SAMPLE UNIT REQUESTED:

One (1) Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) unit delivered to the address below by 17 February 2006.  In addition to the COTS unit, all data that is commercially available is also requested.

<CONTACT>Sheila Johnson, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-377-3901, Fax 202-275-0912, Email sheila.johnson@ed.gov
<DESC>Request for Information (RFI): The U.S. Department of Education (ED), Federal Student Aid, Enterprise Performance Management Service (EMPS), Acquisition Planning and Contracts Management Group (APCMG), is conducting market research  to solicit information from industry regarding technical solution and implementation alternatives for an enterprise-wide acquisitions cost library/repository.  This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of Federal Student Aid to acquire any products and/or services.  FSA does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI nor pay for the information provided.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges will arise as a result of submission of responses to the RFI and Federal Student Aids’s use of such information.

In order to successfully stand-up it's contracting activity as directed by the Secretary's delegation to the Chief Operating Officer on April 1, 2005, Federal Student Aid must execute and/or support, annually, various activities necessary to evolve an acquisition function that delivers continuously increasing value (return on investment) to the organization.  This effort is the next step in providing established standardized processes for the collection of cost data, and an electronic means to catalogue and store cost data, and a standardized structure and process to retrieve cost data for use in cost estimates.  The effort might occur in one or more phases and would involve:

*  Implementation of a cost repository as an interim means to collect and organize cost data that the organization either currently possesses (in hardcopy and softcopy) or will obtain in the future,

*  Establishment of an enterprise-wide work breakdown structure or incorporation of an established enterprise-wide work breakdown structure,

*  Establishment of processes and procedures for the collection of costs and the estimating of future costs,

*  Feasibility study of integrating the cost library with activity-based cost accounting, and

*  Establishment of a cost library database, or its like, that has the capability to categorize and store information in a structure and format that easily facilitates cost research and estimating.

Federal Student Aid lacks credible cost data on which to estimate future costs.  This often results in paying higher prices or, worse yet, the acquisition of a service or product based on a cost/benefit analysis whose benefits are overstated due to incomplete, inaccurate, and/or obsolete data.  A cost library will mitigate the occurrence of such by providing accurate, reliable quantitative and qualitative data to help in the type of short and long-range forecasting required to achieve continuous improvement on return on investment.

Federal Student Aid's vision is that a cost library/repository might include the information listed below.  This listing is not to be considered inclusive or exclusive of any component that might otherwise comprise a cost library/repository.  In fact, Federal Student Aid invites vendors to provide information concerning the best business practices with respect to the establishment, implementation, use, and maintenance of a cost library/repository:

*  Overview and objectives of cost library, including user documentation

*  Methodologies

FSA may contact these customers to discuss lessons learned. 

4.  What commercial and/or government practices and trends could be relevant and successfully applied to a cost library/repository?

5.  What commercial and/or government Risk Management trends could be relevant and successfully applied to cost  library/repository?

6.  Provide an estimated cost associated with all COTS license(s).

7.  Discuss the feasibility, merits, and cost implications of populating a cost library with cost data currently contained in hardcopy files within Federal Student Aid's files vis-a-vis implementing a "point-forward" approach for populating a cost library/repository. 

8.  Provide FTE estimates, resource experience levels, and costs (including hardware) to design, develop, and implement the new cost library/repository.  Include typical labor resources required to research, retrieve, sort, assemble, and scan hardcopy cost data.

9.  Provide schedule/timeline information, including major milestone activities, required to accomplish the goals of establishing a cost library/repository.

10.  Recommend the type of information your company would like to see in the Request for Proposal's Statement of Objectives and Requirements Document that would allow your organization to effectively scope and price the effort.

11.  Provide your business size and any additional company information that you have determined is relevant.

The government instructs that no proprietary or confidential business data be submitted in response to this RFI.

<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-RFI-ORDC-06-01
<RESPDATE>021306
<ARCHDATE>02282006
<CONTACT>Darrick Early, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-205-5668, Fax 202-690-7412, Email darrick.early@hhs.gov
<DESC>*** BACKGROUND *** The National Pandemic Plan of 2005 designates the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as the lead agency for public health and medical response for pandemic preparedness and response. Following the issuance of the HHS Pandemic Plan of 2005, the Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness (OPHEP) was made responsible for the advanced development, establishment of surge capacity, and acquisition of medical countermeasures such as vaccines and antiviral drugs that may be used to contain, control, and mitigate the mortality and morbidity associated with influenza pandemics in the U.S. The tactical and logistical implementation of policies and decisions regarding these pandemic medical countermeasures is the responsibility of the Office of Research and Development Coordination (ORDC) in OPHEP. ***DESCRIPTION*** This is a Request for Information (RFI) only. It is not a request for proposals and does not commit the U.S. Government to issue a solicitation, make an award, or pay any costs associated with responding to this announcement. All submitted information shall remain with the U.S. Government and will not be returned. HHS/OPHEP/ORDC has an interest in identifying potential prophylactic / therapeutic agents likely to be effective in preventing or reducing influenza virus infection. The appropriate use of these antiviral agents during an influenza seasonal or pandemic outbreaks may delay or contain influenza infections in local communities, may reduce the morbidity and mortality, and may mitigate the overwhelming load that will be placed on the healthcare system.

Currently there are two main classes of FDA-licensed antiviral drugs that interfere with the influenza virus infection: adamantanes which act as M2 ion channel blockers (amantidine and rimantidine) and viral neuraminidase inhibitors (zanamivir and oseltamivir phosphate). The U.S. Government has an interest in identifying sources of new antiviral drugs and compounds which could be used potentially during circulation of influenza viruses in a community for treatment or prevention of infection during epidemic or pandemic events. Potential antiviral drugs of interest include neuraminidase inhibitors, inhibitors of hemagglutinin-mediated functions, drugs that block influenza receptor binding, inhibitors of influenza virus fusion, influenza virus RNA polymerase inhibitors, new inhibitors of M2 ion channel activity, snRNAi, polyclonal/monoclonal antibody cocktails, other viral replication inhibitory compounds and other drugs sharing anti-influenza effects. Of particular interest are those antiviral agents that are in clinical development for prevention and/or treatment of influenza infections and that may exhibit longer or greater product shelf-life, efficacy, bioavailability, half-life, and pharmacokinetics for treatment after influenza infection or post exposure. Additionally, of interest are those agents that can be delivered both orally (or by other needleless technology) and parenterally, depending upon the clinical status of the recipient.
   
Interested organizations that have potential candidate drugs or compounds are invited to submit a statement of capability, product description, and development status to HHS/OPHEP/ORDC. Specifically, submitted information depending upon the stage of product development provide  the following: (1) a description of the potential antiviral drug including chemical structure, physical chemical characteristics and biological activity; (2) a description of the method of synthesis, isolation or purification and potency assays; (3) a description of the mechanism of action; (4) a description of the proposed production process; (5) a description of the proposed preclinical or clinical studies; (6) a description of the proposed formulation, dosage and route of administration; (7) regulatory pathway, limitations, and possible obstacles; (8) an estimate of production capacity, manufacturing sites, and timelines and estimated retail costs; and (9) intellectual property accessibility. 

Data obtained from this RFI will be used by HHS in making recommendations and decisions on the development of an appropriate procurement strategy for National Pandemic Preparedness. All information submitted to HHS will be kept confidential as allowed by relevant federal law. 
Information must be submitted by 3:00 pm, February 13, 2006. Responses should be limited to 50 pages in an electronic and hard copy formats and can be e-mailed to the attention of Darrick A. Early, Contract Specialist, phone 202-205-5668, email darrick.early@hhs.gov.  Please ensure that at least one electronic and TWO (2) HARD COPIES of all responses are submitted.

<SUBJECT>K -- Modification of Equipment
<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Acquisitions Management and Operations Branch (AMOB) has a sole source requirement for the modification of imaging equipment to be installed at the Integrated Research Facility (IRF) in Fort Detrick, Maryland.  The Imaging Core in the IRF’s BSL-4 facility will contain four modalities:  MRI, PET/CT, SPECT/CT, and X-Ray.  The imaging equipment must be isolated from the imaging specimen to prevent contamination of the system and eliminate the possibility of infecting non-protected personnel with experimental agents.  The NIAID intends to award a two year contract to Philips Medical Systems (PMS) on a sole source basis, in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1, beginning on or about November 18, 2005, for the modification and installation of the four imaging modalities.  PMS was the only responsible offeror to previously announced NIAID competitive requirements during Phase I of the development program, under which the company provided the four off-the-shelve equipment modalities of PMS brand, conducted feasibility studies and develop concepts and specifications for the modification and installation of the four imaging modalities to meet the NIAID requirements.  The sole source contract hereby announced is for PMS to perform the modifications to the imaging instruments, and for the installation, test and validation of the equipment at the IRF’s BSL-4 facility.  The resources and additional time that would be required for another firm to develop the concept and specifications for modification and installation of the four imaging modalities would be prohibitive to the NIAID and endanger the efficient continuation of several of its research programs.  For these reasons the NIAID believes that no other offeror can fulfill the existing needs for the modification of the imaging equipment for its BSL-4 facility.  Please refer any questions in writing to Ivan Hernandez at Ihernandez@niaid.nih.gov on or before November 18, 2005, at 2:00pm.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulations, Part 12.6 updated through FAC 05-08 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation No. BAQ060004 is issued as a Request for Quotes (RFQ).  This document incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect  and apply to this acquisition: 52-212-1and 52-212-2.  Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items, addendum to include FAR clauses 52.215-5 and 52.212-4. Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial items.  This solicitation provided for full and open competition.  Contractors submitting a quotation must be registered in the Central Contracting Registration web site.  The address to register is www.ccr.gov.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541360. REQUIREMENT:  The Bureau of Land Management, California State Office, Sacramento CA  We need geographically referenced, orthographically corrected, true color aerial photographic coverage of the 16 sampling areas of the Algodones (also called Imperial) Dunes in Imperial County, California (Map 1).  The sampling areas (within which we sample rare plants) are depicted in Map 2 (an ArcGIS shape file will be provided upon request).  The area within each of the sampling areas is given in Table 1.  The aerial photographs need to have a ground resolution of 4 inches and a positional accuracy of +/- 3 meters or better.  The product is to be delivered in geotiff format. The purpose of the aerial photography is to gauge the level of off-highway vehicle (OHV) use in the different areas of the dunes during weekends of heavy OHV use in winter.  This will be accomplished by estimating the cover of vehicle tracks on the GIS layer provided through the contract.  Aerial photography is needed for Presidents' Day weekend 2006.  Because the photographs should be taken after most of the vehicle use has occurred during the day and because vehicle tracks are better discerned with shadows, the photography must be taken late in the afternoon on either Saturday or Sunday of Presidents' Day weekend 2006 (on either February 18 or 19, 2006). If cloud cover prevents the photography from being taken on February 18 or 19, 2006, then the collection of the photography will be deferred until Easter weekend, on the afternoon of either April 15 or 16, 2006.  If cloud cover prevents the photography from being taken on April 15 or 16, 2006, then the photography will be deferred until Thanksgiving weekend, on the afternoons of November 24, 25, or 26, 2006. Winds in excess of 15 miles per hour will also result in the photography being deferred in the same way as described in the paragraph above for cloud cover.  The Contracting Officer's Authorized Representative will contact the successful bidder on the morning of the scheduled flight to cancel the flight if winds are expected to exceed 15 miles per hour.   If the photography is deferred the contractor will be able to recover costs associated with preparation for the flight. Table 1.  Area within each of the 16 sampling areas in the Algodones Dunes.

(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504
of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. 

(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal. 
(End of provision) 
 
NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504
of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. 

(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date ( if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

<DESC>CATEGORY: VENTILATION
CLASSROOMS GET TOO HOT IN THE SUMMER

FINDINGS:
SIX CLASSROOMS HAVE MANY PIECES OF ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT THAT GENERATE HEAT. THE ROOMS ARE FREQUENTLY USED BY A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE AT THE SAME TIME THE WINDOWS ARE SINGLE PANE PROJECTION UNITS WITH VENETIAN BLINDS. THE VENETIAN BLINDS ARE UNSUITABLE BECAUSE THE WINDOWS CANNOT BE OPENED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE PREVAILING BREEZES TO PROVIDE CROSS VENTIALATION OF THE ROOM WITHOUT BEIMG FULLY RAISED.  FULLY RAISING THE BLINDS RESULTS IN UNACCEPTABLE SOLAR LOADING OF THE SPACES. 

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. REMOVE THE BLINDS. APPLY A SEMI-OPAQUE REFLECTIVE FILM TO THE GLASS SURFACES OF THE ROOMS. APPROXIMATELY 4200 SQUARE FEET
2. FILM USED—100% REFLECTIVE, STATIC FREE FILM, TO BE INSTALLED ON THE INSIDE OF WINDOW IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE MANUFACTURER INSTALLATION. 
3. PREFERRED MANUFACTURER: ARMSTRONG MFG. INC., GILA RV FILM INC. OR APPROVED EQUIVALENT.

The RED one is important as it indicates an analogue  pre-amp clipping, before the digital conversion. If lit, the pre-amp gain must be reduced, in extreme cases a 100 dB passive attenuator may be used.  This module may receive 8 analogue signals with following characteristics: Nominal sensitivity 12 dBu (gain at 0dB)
Balanced inputs, phantom power supply (+ 48V) switchable Analog to digital conversion: 24 bits, 48 kHz, Delta-sigma (128 over-sampling).  Programmable gain (1.5 dB steos) from - 27 to + 64.5 dB, sensitivity from 52.5 to +26 dBu or equal.
ITEM  0005:  1 each of Innovason Stage Box:  64 input stage box for Innovason consoles.  The Stage box is an audio rack and a transmission system that allows you to replace your heavy multi-core snake with a simple pair of coaxial cable, or with an optical fiber, thanks to the new MCSC Optical comm module.  XLR connector, preamplifiers, 48V, phase shifter, and converters are located in the Stage Box.  All the parameters are remote-controlled from the console and audio signals transmitted to the console, using coaxial cable or optical fiber.  The Stagebox is also a digital splitter which can feed two or three InnovaSon consoles.  With a small length of cable in the analog domain, all the audio signals come quickly into digital and keep an impressive internal headroom.  That's one of the numerous reasons responsible for the high sonic quality of the InnovaSon consoles.  The Stagebox comes as an option with the InnovaSon  consoles.  At any moment it's possible to add it other input or output (unprocessed) modules to improve the system resources or equal.
ITEM  0006:  3 each of Innovason Coaxial Cable; "Coax 150M": Coax 150M Drum, 450 ft of dual 75 ohm coaxial cable on cable reel or equal.

<DESC>The above referenced combined synopsis/solicitation is hereby amended to change a technical specification in response to a technical question submitted.

The due date for quotations, 3:30 PM Local Time on Friday, December 2, 2005, remains unchanged.

QUESTION:  I'm in process in preparing the quotation regarding the actual NIST bidding and I found a small inconsistency in the required specs.

Assuming bandwidth - limited pulses and a sech^2 pulse shape, the following relation is given: pulsewidth * bandwidth = 0.315
Calculating with an 7ps long pulse, the corresponding bandwidth is 0.17nm. On the other side the pulse duration corresponding to 0.05nm is 24ps. Typically the pulses of a Nd:vanadate picosecond laser are nearly bandwidth limited, which means a typical bandwidth corresponding to 7ps is around 0.2nm.  

Could you please comment on that.

RESPONSE: Upon receipt of this question, NIST noted that Specification (4) conflicts with Specification (7).  Therefore, Specification (4) is being modified.

Specification (4) is hereby changed to read as follows:
(4) Laser Bandwidth must be less than or equal to 0.2 nm;
