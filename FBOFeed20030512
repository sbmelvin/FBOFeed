<SUBJECT>B--Demographic Consequences of the Offshore Petroleum Industry
<SOLNBR>0103RP72637
<RESPDATE>060303
<ARCHDATE>05112004
<CONTACT>Melissa Rountree Contract Specialist 7037871354     Melissa.Rountree;
<DESC>The analysis of demographic effects is important to social impact assessment (SIA), leading to issues of growth and decline, benefits and burdens, social change and conflict. The petroleum industry has affected Texas and Louisiana demographics directly, and indirectly as a catalyst for other changes.  The industry's consequences have been significant, their characteristics, magnitude, and distribution have changed over time.  While several research projects have addressed the industry's demographic consequences to the region, these consequences have yet to be systematically addressed.  Even at the level of demographic monitoring, there is a lack of understanding of demographic change in geographic areas in which work for the industry has taken place.  Fabrication, exploration and production all have effects on employment that could lead to in-migration (or reduce out-migration).  The relationship between migration and age is well documented, and migration- induced age-structure changes are likely to be associated with other correlates of the age structure.  SIA commonly addresses large new projects in small communities.  New labor demand, particularly during construction, induces immigration which causes other socioeconomic effects. However, the demographic effects that MMS must address are not short-term, project-related, or localized.  They come on the heels of 100 years of petroleum industry activity and 50 years of activity offshore.  Projects are familiar, local labor is poised to meet the demand, and each project blends into the next.  These effects are from the routine operations of varied oil-related enterprises rather than from the concentrated activities of the construction trades. The customary SIA emphasis on boomtowns also does not fit the current situation well.  The offshore industry has produced economic booms and busts but few boomtowns.  In sum, the demographic consequences of the petroleum industry and the offshore petroleum industry are not well documented. The MMS seeks an assessment for Texas and Louisiana of the petroleum industry's demographic effects that will be used to: (1) reassess the Agency's impact assessment strategies to better reflect Gulf Region realities, (2) improve its assessments of cumulative effects, (3) support a more comprehensive analyses of current effects, and (4) refine the Agency's projections of sale-level effects.  THE OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY ARE: 1) To provide a coherent description of such changes in demographic effects through time and the reasons behind these changes through the analysis of a coherent set of research questions as defined by the research design.  2) To provide a general understanding of the industry's demographic effects and causes of those effects over time.  As the industry and society have evolved, these effects have changed.  For example, while early onshore hydrocarbon discoveries often led to localized "boomtowns," the recent large discoveries in deepwater have not.  3) To provide a general understanding of variation (state and sub-state) in those effects and the causes of this variation.  For example, the demographic consequences of the 1980s oil price collapse were different for Texas than for Louisiana.  MMS seeks a coherent description of the reasons behind such variation. 4) To provide a differentiated and well documented data system that would allow a continuous monitoring of demographic changes in the future.  MMS defines demography broadly to include population size, structure, dynamics, racial and ethnic composition, household structure, migration, and commuting, and related population characteristics potentially affected by the petroleum industry such as health, education, poverty, and employment status.  THE ESTIMATED COST OF THIS STUDY IS BETWEEN $275,000 and $300,000 over (30) months from the time of award of time.  The MMS envisions a research team with a core of two or three experts with substantial time dedicated to the project.  The study consists of four (4) main tasks: (1) establishing a Quality Review Board, (2) developing a research design, (3) literature search and synthesis, and (4) data collection and analysis.  The procurement for this requirement will be in two Phases.  HOW TO RESPOND TO PHASE I:  In order to compete for this contract, interested parties must demonstrate that they are qualified to perform work by providing Capabilities Statements no later than 5 p.m. on June 3rd, 2003, detailing: (1) Scientific personnel responsible for the collection, interpretation and synthesis of information.  Particularly relevant is their expertise in the areas of demography and the history and/or effects of the petroleum industry, their experience in work similar to that proposed, and their demonstrated ability to do the work.  Scientific personnel must collectively demonstrate the relevant experience in the relevant disciplines.  This experience should be demonstrated through work experience (e.g., work on similar research projects, relevant courses taught, etc.) and/or authorship of relevant books and/or articles published in appropriate peer reviewed journals. The similarity of past work to this research project will be considered.  (2) Past Performance.  Include your organization's experience and success in managing this type of work and the technical personnel's experience in participating in this kind of work.  Also include a description of the organization, the experience of its support personnel, and information about your subcontractors, partners, and quality of cooperation between organization, staff, key personnel, and clients.  ALL REFERENCES WILL BE CHECKED TO VALIDATE THE INFORMATION PROVIDED.  Offerors shall submit their Capabilities Statement in original and two (2) copies and one electronic copy in MS Word on a floppy disk or cd to Minerals Management Service, 381 Elden Street, Procurement Operations Branch MS 2500, Herndon VA  20170-4817, Attention:  Melissa Rountree.  In addition, Offerors shall send four (4) copies to Ms. Connie Landry, MS 5431, Minerals Management Service, 1201 Elmwood Park Boulevard, New Orleans LA  70123-2394. YOUR CAPABILITIES STATEMENT WILL BE EVALUATED BASED ON: (1) the qualifications of each key personnel and relevance of these qualifications to the research project, and the breadth and depth of the qualifications of all the key personnel for meeting the goals of the research project. (2) the ability of the organization responsible for the research to monitor and manage the research to complete projects in a timely manner, adhere to schedules and budgets, maintain effective cost controls, and ensure the delivery of quality products; the degree of comparability of past projects to the current project, and the quality of cooperation between organization, staff, and key personnel and the client.  Past performance of the organization, subcontractors and partners will be considered.  Assessment factors for technical personnel responsible for the organization of information and the production of documents and manuscripts will be their qualifications and the relevance of their qualifications to their assigned task.  Following Phase I, the review and evaluation of all Capabilities Statements, only those determined from the evaluation factors described above to be most qualified to successfully perform the effort will be invited to Phase II of the procurement and will be provided a detailed Request for Proposal.  ALL OFFERORS WILL BE NOTIFIED OF THE RESULTS OF PHASE I.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC has issued a Cooperative Agreement Notice (CAN) for innovative information technology products for delivery of NASA content directly to learners via various venues such as museums, science centers, and other learning environments. The purpose of this LEARNERS II CAN is to focus research and development innovations in a direction that will move NASA's technology contributions into the forefront of education. In order to achieve this objective, LEARNERS II will support the development of remote experiences of real NASA missions through virtual presence using computer-based interactive environments. Finally, LEARNERS II will work with cooperative agreement partners to maximize the delivery of these experiences through the immersive technology environment. Successful proposals will apply current research on teaching and learning with technology to achieve meaningful utilization of immersive technology in learning environments based upon NASA data and information. LEARNERS II seeks products to contribute to the capability to represent NASA events and mission milestones as virtual events that surround the learner with a visual, aural and even tactile experience.  In addition to the requirements outlined in the CAN requiring offerors to submit a formal notification of intent, prospective offerors are also requested to notify this office of their intent to submit an offer. Email notifications are acceptable which simply indicate your organizations intent to submit a proposal.  No other information is requested through this informal notification.   It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet sites	for the release of the CAN and amendments (if any).  Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the CAN and amendments (if any). The CAN is available over the Internet in two locations. The NASA GSFC LEARNERS site is  http://procurement.nasa.gov/EPS/GSFC/class.html  . Potential recipients will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the DRFP. Any referenced notes can be viewed at the following URL:  http://genesis.gsfc.nasa.gov/nasanote.html  .  All contractual and/or technical questions to this CAN must be submitted in writing.  Telephone questions will not be accepted. All qualified responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency. To avoid a conflict of interest, submissions from the University of Maryland Baltimore County (or its affiliates) will not be accepted.   The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. See Note 26.  An ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA Specific Note "B". The NAICS Code and Size Standard are 611710 and $6.0M respectively.  The expected release date of the CAN is not defined at this time.  It is anticipated that release will occur in May 2003. Offerors will have a 30 day period in which to submit proposals from the date that the CAN is first posted to the above 2 web addresses.  Offerors are responsible for monitoring these web sites for the availability of the CAN and calculation of the proposal due date 30 days from the issuance date.

<DESC>NA The Gov will issue a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA KY-68), for the Communications Security Logistics Activity (CSLA). The purpose of this synopsis is to notify industry of the upcoming BAA KY-68 and to call for White Papers.  CSLA is seeking White Papers to identify Research and Development methods for a cost effective solution to combining Future Narrow Band Digital Terminal (FNBDT) capabilities with critical operational functions of the current KY-68 system into a single device capable of operating withi n both the current MSE/TRI-TAC architecture and as a stand-alone system that interfaces with other devices in the FNBDT family.  To accomplish this objective we will examine critical operational capabilities and requirements of the Ã¢Â€ÂœKY-68 systemÃ¢Â€Â  including ancillary devices and identify current cryptographic capabilities and approaches through the BAA KY-68.    The Government will evaluate the initial white papers which will give offerors some indication of whether a full study proposal will likel y result in an award.  The Government anticipates award of studies to several companies that outline approaches to providing secure voice capability.  Studies will include a mix of manufacturing and research organizations.  It is the GovernmentÃ¢Â€Â™s inte nt to use the results of the accepted studies to formulate the resulting acquisition strategy and requirement.  Offerors are required to identify any limitations of technical data in their white papers and subsequent study.  Based upon the results of the s tudies, the Government intends to award a multiphase contract to one or possibly two vendors in which the first phase is a proof of concept.  Production would occur after down-selection to one vendor based upon results of the proof of concept phase.   Comp anies having the required specialized capabilities to meet the above requirements are encouraged to submit a white page as follows; Number of Pages Ã¢Â€Â“ 10 single-sided pages (excluding cover page (s) and diagrams).

<DESC>The FISC Norfolk Detachment Philadelphia intends to procure an estimated 215,000 hours of non-personal engineering and technical services in support of the U.S. Joint Forces Command training mission.  This acquisition will provide USJFCOM with additional contractor support that is required for Joint Force Training and Exercise Programs, Crisis Rehearsals, Training Facility Support (including (1) training program support, (2) exercise scenario development, (3) simulation design, operation, control, and analysis, (4) analytical support to after action reporting, (5) OPFOR staff functions, (6) major exercise support to CINC’s and battlestaffs, and (7) systems management and operation), and New Simulation Technologies.  The additional level of effort is required due to emergent requirements based on real-world current events and the creation of the Joint National Training Capability.  FISC Norfolk Detachment Philadelphia intends to procure the required services through a modification to contract N00140-01-C-1195 with TRW Inc., Systems & Information Technology Group pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), “Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements” as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  TRW is currently providing the aforementioned services to the USJFCOM under contract N00140-01-C-1195 which was awarded on 15 September 2001 and has a performance period through 28 Feb 2007, if all options are exercised.  The instant procurement is to provide additional contractor support that is required to accomplish tasks related to requirements analysis, event planning and execution, coordinated live, virtual, and constructive simulation training, crisis rehearsals and analysis, and Joint universal lessons learned.  The additional support is required to accomplish task requirements that are integrally related to the work that TRW is performing under contract N00140-01-C-1195.  Because these task requirements are inseparable from the work that TRW is performing, it would be impractical to have a contractor other than TRW provide the required support.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received by the specified response date will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 541330.  Numbered note 22 applies.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), 
plans to procure assays (IGF-1), (IGFBP-1), and (IGFBP-3), Insulin-Like Growth Factor (IGF-1) axis measured in Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension-Sodium (DASH Sodium) trial, from St. Joseph Hospital, 360 Broadway, Bangor, Maine 04401.  The acquisition is being conducted under the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13. The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541380 and the business size standard is $6M.
The proposed analyses will determine the effect of the DASH-Sodium diets on serum IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP) -3, and IGFBP-1.  From stored serum specimens,  IGF-1, IGFBP-3, and IGFBP-1 will be assessed, and the changes from baseline will be compared across diets. The DASH and DASH Sodium clinical feeding trials (both completed) were studies that demonstrated that compared to a typical American diet (control), a diet rich in fruits, vegetables and low-fat dairy products and reduced in saturated fat, total fat and cholesterol as well as, a diet with lower than average salt intake could substantially lower blood pressure in subjects with and without high blood pressure. The studies were done extramurally at Johns Hopkins University.  DASH-Sodium was funded by National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI); studies U01-HL57139 and K08 HL03857-01.  Specimens used for this study must come from the Johns Hopkins site.  The contractor shall measure IGF-1, IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-3 concentrations on stored blood samples from a pilot study of subjects fed a high fat/low fiber (39.5% fat, 15.6% protein, 46.4% carbohydrate, 5 gms crude dietary fiber) vs. low fat/high fiber (18.3% fat, 18.7% protein, 66.1% carbohydrate, 14 gms crude dietary fiber) crossover design, 10-week feeding trial.  NCI requires the assays from MEDCORE laboratory to get comparable assay results.  St. Joseph's Hospital is the only source known to the NCI that can supply the required assays.  The assay samples for the pilot study are from the "Metabolic effects of changes in dietary fat and fiber in men."  It was an NCI study done in 1986 by the Project Officer when working for the Cancer Prevention Studies Branch in DCPC in collaboration with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).  The laboratory at St. Joseph's Hospital measured the IGF-1, IGFBP-1, and IGFBP-3 analytes on this pilot study.  NCI must have comparable results for the analytes of that which were done on the pilot study, whose results are mentioned above.  St. Joseph's performed the first of these assays.  The requirement shall measure the results of the assays.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements herein.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EDT (local Washington DC time) on May 27, 2003.  If you have any questions, please submit them in writing via electronic mail to Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent on holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The Earth Science Enterprise (ESE) has a leading role in NASA's mission to understand and protect our home planet, by advancing Earth system science to enable improved prediction of climate, weather and natural hazards and their effects on life.  Using aerospace science and technology as well as the vantage point of space, we seek to observe, analyze, and model the Earth system to discover how it is changing and the consequences for life on Earth.  In addition, we have an essential role to play in inspiring the next generation by revolutionizing how Earth science is taught in the US by showing how the Earth functions as a system supporting life, and by using our data and information to strengthen curricula and teaching in science, math, engineering and technology from kindergarten to post-graduate levels.  (See NASA 2003 Strategic Plan at http://www.plans.nasa.gov/).   The New Investigator Program (NIP) in Earth Science was established in Fiscal Year 1996 to encourage the integration of Earth system science research and education by scientists and engineers at the early stage of their professional careers. The program, designed for investigators in Earth system science and applications at academic institutions and non-profit organizations, emphasizes the early development of professional careers of these individuals as both researchers and educators.  The program encourages scientists and engineers to develop a broader sense of responsibility for effectively contributing to the improvement of science education and the public science literacy; it provides an opportunity for the investigators to develop partnerships and/or enhance their skills, knowledge, and ability to communicate the excitement, challenge, methods, and results of their work to teachers, students, and the public.  The Earth Science Enterprise places particular emphasis on the investigators' ability to promote and increase the use of Earth remote sensing through the proposed research and education projects. The NIP proposals are openly solicited approximately every eighteen months. The awards, to be provided in the form of "education grants", range between $80,000-$120,000 per year for a period of up to three years, subject to satisfactory progress and availability of funds. Proposals submitted in response to this announcement will be competing for approximately $2.0 million per year beginning in Fiscal Year 2004.  This solicitation will be available electronically on the release date at the NASA Headquarters Research Opportunities web site http://research.hq.nasa.gov/ under "Office of Earth Science (Code Y)". Paper copies of the NRA will be available to those who do not have access to the Internet by calling (202) 358-3552 and leaving a voice mail message. Please provide full name and address, including ZIP code, and a telephone number, including area code.

<DESC>The U.S.Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Plum Island Animal Disease Center, Orient Point, New York, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with STV Construction, Inc., 205 West Welsh Drive, Douglasville, PA 19518 to relocate temporary emergency generator's and perform essential maintenance.  These generators were installed by STV, Inc., in December 2002 due to a power failure causing a failure in the generator control switchgear.  Furthermore, STV designed and installed the electrical loop feeder system and the electrical switchgear system, and has the expert knowledge of the electrical system of the facility.  The generators need to be moved and connected to a 2400 volt buss to allow a safer and more expedient means of backup power, permit closed transition switching, and allow the Island to go on generator without interruption of power in the event of an outage.  This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals.  The contracting action will be other than full and open competition under the Authority 41 U.S.C. 253 and FAR 6-302-2(b), (1)(2).  No formal solitation package is available.  The Government anticipates an award date after June 1, 2003.

<DESC>Air Force Research Laboratory, Munitions Directorate (AFRL/MN) is interested in receiving technical and cost proposals for the study of the behavior of tantalum in proto-type warhead designs; and consolidation and fabrication of warhead liner blanks from powder tantalum to be delivered to the Damage Mechanisms Branch at Eglin Air Force Base, FL. One of the manufacturing methods of interest is the use of powder tantalum as a means for making warhead liner blanks. Working with powder tantalum could eliminate the technical risk associated with using wrought tantalum products. There may also be a cost savings found in the fabrication of a near net shape piece that generates less scrap material. One of the engineering parameters identified in limited studies of powder tantalum is the effect of oxygen concentration in the starting powder. Excessively high concentration of oxygen, 300 parts per million (PPM) by weight, is known to produce deficiencies in the performance of the material. Specifically, the material ductility, needed for explosive formation, is seriously degraded. The specific steps (tasks) involved within this effort by the contractor are to be as follows: 1.

It is the policy of AFRL/MN to treat all proposals as privileged information prior to award, and to disclose the contents only for the purposes of evaluation. The Offeror must indicate on the appropriate proposal page(s) any limitation to be placed on disclosure of information contained in the proposal. In accordance with PRDA guidelines, the technical evaluation will rank proposals into three categories defined as follows: Category I: Category I proposals must be well-conceived, scientifically and technically sound, pertinent to program goals and objectives, and offered by a responsible contractor with the competent scientific and technical staff and supporting resources needed to ensure satisfactory program results. Category I proposals are recommended for acceptance (subject to availability of funds) and normally will be displaced only by other Category I proposals. Category II: Category II proposals are scientifically or technically sound but may require further development. They can be recommended for acceptance, but are a lower priority than Category I. Proposals in this category are not usually funded. Category III: Category III proposals are not technically sound or do not meet agency needs. They are not recommended for award. The technical and cost information will be evaluated at the same time. The U.S. Air Force reserves the right to select for award one or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement. Offerors may contact the individuals or sections listed herein to obtain generally available clarification of technical/contractual issues and cost proposal format or pricing information.

IMPORTANT NOTICES TO OFFERORS
1.	As allowed by FAR 15.201(c)(6), this is a DRAFT Request for Proposal (RFP) of which information and input relative to the overall hydrazine acquisition strategy, as well as individual elements of the RFP, are strongly encouraged from industry.  Although it is not guaranteed that all input will form the basis of a revision of the draft RFP into the final version, industry input, to the greatest degree it can be, will be considered.  Comments from industry relative to the overall acquisition strategy and/or specific provisions contained herein, are due, in writing, to the Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) Contracting Officer NLT COB May 23, 2003.
	
2.	This solicitation is for the purchase of Hydrazine product, all grades, and/or hydrazine related services, in accordance with The Schedule (and Exhibits A through Q).  An Exhibit consists of one specific CLIN for all years against which an offer may be submitted.  DESC is soliciting offers for products and services in support of the entire Government’s hydrazine requirements   The RFP is structured in order to allow offerors to propose on one performance scenario and/or multiple scenarios, as follows:

a.	A “turnkey operation,” that is, production of all grades and all quantities of hydrazine, 
	blending of certain grades to make a finished product, batch and/or bulk storage, and on-site distribution services, that is, FOB Origin.  In this performance scenario, that is, Offeror Proposal Package 2, the Government will provide all transportation services involved with delivering product to the end-use customer from the contractor’s production facility.  [Proposal Package 2].  In addition, offerors may also choose to provide transportation of product to the end- use customer, in lieu of Government-provided transportation, that is, FOB Destination [Proposal Package 1].
	
b.	In addition to or in lieu of the performance scenario described in 1.a. above, offerors 
	may choose to propose on production of product only.  This performance scenario is contained in Proposal Package 3.  In this performance scenario the Government will perform all other services such as blending, bulk storage, distribution and transportation.  However, the contractor is required to have batch storage capability at the production facility for quality and quantity inspection and acceptance.  Under this performance scenario, blending, bulk storage, and distribution services will be performed at NASA/Kennedy Space Center (NASA/KSC) and/or Vandenberg AFB (VAFB).  Transportation services to one and/or both locations would be provided by DESC.  Under Proposal Package 4, the same performance scenario would apply except (1) the contractor would provide the transportation services to move bulk product from the production facility to either NASA/KSC and/or VAFB; and (2) batch storage would not be required at the production facility.  Inspection and acceptance shall be in accordance with B1.09-2.100 para 7-9.
	
c.	Based on the preceding discussion, offerors may propose on any one performance 
	scenario, or all scenarios or any combination thereof.  If offerors propose on more than one performance scenario, a separate Offeror Proposal Ppackage must be submitted for each of the performance scenarios.  In addition, alternate proposals may be submitted.  Only one contract will result from this solicitation.  See Clause M2.11.100 EVALUATION – COMMERCIAL ITEMS (HYDRAZINE) for the basis of award.

3.	The Schedule and applicable Exhibits
4.	All required documentation in accordance with the Instruction to Offerors - Technical Proposal Submittal.

a.	Relative to development of offers for both FOB Destination performance scenarios, estimated quantities to be delivered to end-use customer(s) [Proposal Package 1] or NASA/KSC and/or VAFB [Proposal Package 4]  are provided as Attachment ____ to the solicitation.

3.	Options shall be considered in the evaluation for contract award. 
	
4.	By authority granted in the fiscal year 2003 DoD Authorization Bill, DESC intends to award a contract with a term of ten years and two five-year options.  The contract shall be a fixed price with Economic Price Adjustment (EPA) .  The Government intends to apply the EPA IAW Clause  B19.40.100 to product CLINs 0005 through 0009, as well as to the service CLINS 0004, and 0010 through 0020.  In order to apply an EPA in accordance with regulatory guidance, offerors are required to provide the percentage of labor costs for CLIN 0004, as well as 0010 through 0020.  The sole purpose of this information will be to apply the EPA to labor costs in accordance with Clause B19.40.100.  Only the percentage that is labor will be escalated/deescalated.  
		
5.

The Food and Drug Administration, Center for Veterinary Medicine (FDA/CVM) intends to issue a sole source procurement using Simplified Acquisition Procedures to Gilbert Kaplan.  FDA/CVM has a need for technical assistance with coordination and planning of the FY2003 FDA/ORA, Field Workplan Development.    The contractor will be responsible for extracting animal feed contaminant data covering mycotoxins, pesticides and microbials from FDA’s Field Accomplishment and Compliance Tracking System (FACTS).  He will generate hard copies of the analytical results and draft initial reports summarizing the data.  He will also provide quality assurance on the final reports that are prepared by CVM/Division of Animal Feeds’ scientists.  The contractor will assist in developing field assignments and determining resource needs that deal specifically with feed contaminants.  He will troubleshoot for the three compliance programs (feed contaminants, Type A medicated article and medicated feed) that fall under the responsibility of the Division of Animal Feeds.  The period of performance is from May 30, 2003 through the September 30, 2004.   This requirement will be awarded on a sole source basis because Mr. Kaplan is the only known source possessing the wide array of knowledge and insight of the pesiticide and mycotoxin data in FACTS.  He has compiled this data into a quarterly report format and serves as a data verifier.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Cartridge components include an aluminum cartridge case, black powder flashtube assembly, nose cap, projectile body, M36A2 percussion primer, and propellant.  Cartridge performance requirements include Function and Casualty, Muzzle Velocity, Chamber  Pressure, Action Time, Accuracy, Environmental Conditions, and Waterproofness.  The technical data package (TDP) is classified Distribution X (limited distribution).  This TDP contains technical data whose export is restricted by the Arms Export Control A ct, (Title 22, U.S.C., SEC 2751 ET SEQ.) or the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended titled, 50 U.S.C. APP 2240, ET SEQ.  Violation of these export laws is subject to severe criminal penalties.  Disseminate IAW provision of DOD Directive 5230.25. Offerors must be registered with the U.S./Canada Joint Certification Office to obtain a copy of the specification and top drawings (See www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/ for instructions and information).  Upon receipt of required certification, request a copy of the specification and top level drawings via e-mail to schmollj@osc.army.mil.  The request must include cage code, company name, address, phone number, e-mail address and point of contact. A respondent to this market survey must have the facilities and skills required to design and qualify the 30mm PGU-15/B TP cartridge.  Specific production capabilities and skills required to manufacture the 30mm PGU-15/B TP Cartridge are as follows: flash tube loader for loading and sealing black powder into the flashtube; pr ime case machine to insert the flashtube assembly and percussion primer into the cartridge case; propellant loader to weigh propellant and charge the cartridge case; cartridge assembly loader to insert the projectile body into the cartridge case, crimp, an d gage cartridge chamber and height; pack-out equipment to assemble cartridges into tubes and load into containers; and ballistic test facilities and equipment for measuring velocity, pressure, action time, time of flight, etc.  Besides Load, Assemble, and  Pack (LAP) equipment, additional production capabilities required are furnaces for heat treat and annealing, metal forming and machining equipment, anodize and phosphate systems, material handling systems, tool room equipment, ultrasonic test equipment, a nd metrology and metallurgy laboratories.  Production of the PGU-15/B Cartridge is very complex and requires sophisticated industrial capabilities.  Specific skills required to produce the PGU-15/B Cartridge include: ammunition process/design engineers, se t-up mechanics familiar with ammunition component and LAP production equipment; toolmakers and machinists to support all production facilities/equipment; personnel for programming and operation of LAP manufacturing equipment; certified inspectors, quality control engineers, and ballistics test personnel for in-process and final inspection, pack-out, First Article Test (FAT) and Lot Acceptance Test (LAT) ballistics testing, and shipment of ammunition products; machine operators for set-up and operation of va rious metal forming and machine tool production manufacturing equipment; personnel with expertise to control heat treat, quench, temper of metal products to obtain ductility and hardness requirements; personnel familiar with phosphate and anodizing systems ; ultrasonic technicians; metallurgists to test raw materials throughout the process to a finished product; personnel with extensive expertise in the manufacture and handling of propellant; and skills needed to maintain several items of unique or special t ype pieces of the equipment and facilities.  These critical skills require an extended period to acquire the job knowledge adequate to provide a quality product  in a timely manner.  A respondentÃ¢Â€Â™s production capacity must be sufficient to manufacture a total quantity of approximately 100,000,000 cartridges per year.  Interested U.S./Canadian firms who feel they are capable of manufacturing 30MM PGU-15/B TP C artridges are invited to indicate their interest by providing the Government a brief summary of their companyÃ¢Â€Â™s capabilities, including a brief description of facilities, personnel and past manufacturing experience as it relates to the above criteria.

<DESC>The US Army TACOM-ARDEC at Picatinny Arsenal, New Jersey plans to release an RFP for the production of Bunker Defeat Munitions.  It is currently the  intention of TACOM-ARDEC to issue a sole-source Firm Fixed Price contract to  Talley Defense Systems, Mesa Arizona 85215 pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii).   This is a follow-on contract for continued production of unique supplies from  the original developer, and award to any other source would likely result in  substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be  recovered through competition, and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Army’s  requirements.  PEO for Ammunition has approved the Section 806 Determination  for Talley to continue production of the BDM and maintain the current  industrial base until an alternate producer or design is is qualified and  delivering systems  (See annoucement entitled BDM Best Value).  The proposed  basic contract is for 989 each BDM and 43 sets of Field Handling Trainers and  Training Material.  The contract contains the following options: 900 each BDM  in FY03, 759 each BDM with 33 sets of Field Handling Trainers and Traning  Material in FY04, 897 each with 39 sets of Field Handling Trainers and Traning  Material in FY05, 920 each with 40 sets of Field Handling Trainers and Traning  Material in FY06, and 207 each with 9 sets of Field Handling Trainers and  Traning Material in FY07.  Submittal of information is requested via electronic  mail only to Louisa Melendez:  melendez@pica.army.mil. This is not a  solicitation and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.

As part of market research, The Air Education and Training Command (AETC) is in the process of developing an acquisition strategy for a performance-based service contract to support Air Force Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Selection Training.  This RFI is an attempt to locate large as well as any and all types of small business capable of performing this type of requirement in an effective standardized Air Force flying training screening program at lower than current AF costs.  Therefore, this RFI is not to be construed as a formal solicitation nor does not constitute a current or any future Government requirement.  Any information provided to the Government is strictly voluntary and at no costs to the Government.  Any formal solicitation will be announced separately.  The Air Force is only interested at this point in determining industry’s capabilities for the contemplated services.  To this end, private sector industry is invited to submit capability and cost information demonstrating the ability to meet any or all of the following scenarios.  Request responses be provided NLT 6 Jun 2003.

Requirement.  This acquisition is for non-personal services necessary to provide for a flying training screening program that will require evaluating approximately 1,000 students per year prior to the successful students entering Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training (SUPT).  The purpose of this program is to identify those students who have the potential to complete the USAF SUPT Program.

1.  We are currently considering three alternatives (with separate location scenarios; each scenario assuming a smooth flow of students):  

A.  Flight training sites located near current SUPT locations (Enid, OK; Del Rio, TX; Wichita Falls, TX; Columbus, MS; Valdosta, GA; Milton, FL) to provide training only.  No housing or meals provided by contractor. 

B.	A single training location with training, housing and meals provided by contractor.

C.  Regional (2 – 4) training sites with training, housing and meals provided by contractor.  

2.  All alternatives will require:

A.  Access to a sufficient number of aircraft (2-seat minimum) to fly and screen approximately 1,000 students per year total; available through contractor ownership or lease; with the following preferred aircraft characteristics: 

(1)	Accommodate student weights ranging from 103 lbs. to 245 lbs
.
(2)	Accommodate student heights from 64”-77” tall and sitting heights of 34”-40”.  

B.  Capability to perform all private pilots maneuvers (except night, instrument and cross-country flights) in a 25-flight hour standardized Air Force screening syllabus (23 hours dual in 17 sorties and 2 hours solo in 2 sorties).  Assume that the students have no previous flight hours.

C.	Cost estimate offering the 25-hour flying time training program, to include all ground training and support as defined in paragraph 1A, B and C. 

D.  Sufficient infrastructure to support this workload and operations.

E.  Demonstrated operations of a professional work environment in both approach and appearance.

F.  A comparison of contractor’s safety record to the general aviation safety record.  Answer must include the contractor’s accident rate per 100,000 flight hour as a minimum.  

Alternate methods of meeting the objectives of the Air Force Flight Screening program are encouraged.

Period of Performance.  TBA

Small Business Set-Aside.  The Government reserves the right to consider a small or small disadvantaged business set aside based on responses to this notice.  For purposes of this acquisition, the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of 611512, Flight Training, will be used for this acquisition.  The business size standard is $21.5M.  ALL types of small business entities are encouraged to submit a response.

<SUBJECT>Pre-Solicitation Conference for GWSB construction contract
<DESC>The Department of Energy (DOE) Savannah River Operations Office (SR) is holding a pre-solicitation conference on May 22, 2003 in Augusta, GA to discuss the construction procurement for a Glass Waste Storage Building (GWSB).  The purpose of the pre-solicitation conference is to provide potential offerors information on DOE?s proposed approach for procuring a construction contractor and for DOE to better understand industry concerns and issues.  Information learned during this meeting will be considered in the development of the Request for Proposals.  The pre-solicitation conference will be held at the Partridge Inn in Augusta, GA from 8:30 ? 12:00 followed by a tour of SRS from 1:00 ? 4:30. SR plans to set aside the procurement for small businesses in accordance with FAR 19.5. This acquisition is classified as North American Industry Classification (NAIC) #237990, Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction. The size standard under this NAIC is $28.5 million.  Although the procurement will be set aside for small businesses, the successful firm may choose to subcontract up to 85% of the work.  Therefore, firms interested in subcontracting opportunities are also encouraged to attend the pre-solicitation conference. The anticipated construction contract is in support of the DOE Environmental Management mission.  High Level Waste (HLW) is currently stored in tank farms at the Savannah River Site (SRS).  The Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) vitrifies the HLW, and seals it in stainless steel canisters.  The canisters are then transported to the GWSB for interim storage until it can be permanently transferred to the Federal repository.  The first GWSB is nearing capacity and a second GWSB is required to continue to meet DWPF?s storage requirements. The second GWSB will be a below-grade structure with a footprint of approximately 210? X 210?.  It will consist of four vaults and store capacity of 2,340 canisters.  The vault walls support the grade level floor.  The floor must support the weight of the 235,000-pound Shielded Canister Transport (SCT) and large plugs that provide radiological shielding of the canisters.  The SCT removes the plugs, inserts the canisters through the openings in the floor, and replaces the plugs.  Each canister is expected to radiate 5,000 rem per hour and can generate 1,000 watts of heat that must be removed by a ventilation system.  An above grade superstructure spans the entire width and length of the storage facility with no supporting columns except around the perimeter. This structure protects the vaults from adverse weather. The GWSB vaults and canister supports must be constructed to meet DOE nuclear design ?safety class? requirements.  This is necessary to protect the public, the environment, and facility workers from unacceptable radiation exposure in the event of structurally significant natural phenomena such as tornadoes, earthquakes, etc.  The above grade superstructure is not a safety-related structure. Among the items that will be discussed at the pre-solicitation conference are: Project overview, Procurement approach and schedule, Bonding requirements, Funding profiles, Working capital and cash flow, Construction schedule, and Labor issues.  Attendees will also be given a tour of the GWSB #1 and the proposed site of GWSB #2.  Attendance at the pre-solicitation conference is not mandatory.  Companies not attending may request copies of the material presented and will remain eligible to receive the RFP and submit proposals. This is NOT a Request For Proposals.  Potential offerors interested in attending this pre-solicitation conference must submit the following information no later than COB May 16, 2003: 1) Full name of attendee(s); 2) Company represented and address; 3) Social Security number, and 4) citizenship.  Please note that due to security requirements, only U.S. citizens will be allowed to participate in the SRS tour.  Space is limited. Companies are asked to limit participation to 2-3 representatives.  Responses should be submitted electronically to donna.anderson@srs.gov or faxed to (803) 725-8573, ATTN: Donna Anderson.

<DESC>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) FI5730008T6, U.S. AIR FORCE (AF) MENTOR-PROTEGE PROGRAM FOR THE AIR FORCE MENTOR-PROTEGE CENTER OF EXCELLENCE 311th HUMAN SYSTEMS WING SMALL BUSINESS OFFICE (HSW/BC). 

POC:  Clifford Trowbridge, (210) 472-5042: mailto:clifford.trowbridge@gsa.gov or Karen Beyer, (210) 472-5040: karen.beyer@gsa.gov.

All questions must be submitted in writing to Clifford Trowbridge or Karen Beyer.

A. INTRODUCTION: 

The Government intends to fund Mentor-Protege agreements by issuing contracts over three separate award cycles. The schedule for Round I is as follows:  Round I Proposals must be received no later than 14 February 2003, 3:00 PM, Central Time, in order to be considered for the initial round of awards. The initial award cycle will follow on or about 15 April 2003. The schedule for Rounds II and III will be posted at a later date.  This BAA announcement will remain in effect until 15 Oct 03.  For additional Air Force Mentor-Protege Program Information, visit http://www.brooks.af.mil/HSW/BC/MP .

Proposals submitted in response to this announcement shall be submitted through the GSA web based Information Technology Solutions Shop (ITSS).  Contractors are responsible for registering with ITSS.  (http://it-solutions.gsa.gov)

The Government has reserved limited funding for 10 awards under an AF initiative restricted to teams proposing proteges who are start-up Native American Owned and/or Women Owned Businesses. 

B. OBJECTIVE:  The purpose of this DoD program is to incentivize DoD contractors to assist small disadvantaged business (SDBs) in enhancing their capabilities to satisfy DoD and other contract and subcontract requirements, and to increase the overall participation of SDBs in the DoD market place. The objective is to help foster the relationship between the two parties to increase the industrial supplier base and enable SDB transition from sub- to prime contractors. An additional intent is to increase subcontract opportunities under the Mentor's contracts, DoD contracts, other government agency contracts, and commercial contracts.

Under this program, companies approved as mentor firms will enter into mentor-protege agreements with eligible SDBs to provide appropriate developmental assistance to enhance their protege capabilities in the technology areas listed in this BAA under Section D. The anticipated developmental assistance areas shall include: technology transfer, engineering and technical matters such as production, inventory control, quality assurance, and any other assistance designed to develop the capabilities of the protege firm under the development program. A complete description of the program and eligibility requirements are provided in Appendix I of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS).






C. APPROACH: The Government intends to use a competitive Two Tiered approach under this announcement.

TWO-TIERED COMPETITION

The Two-Tiered initiative applies to teams proposing proteges who are start-up Native American Owned and/or Women Owned Businesses. The AF envisions these Protege(s) shall qualify within half the size standards of the stated NAICS in Section D. The mentor and protege firm shall agree upon a proposed technology (IAW Section D of this announcement) and outline their approach to Tier One activities in a 10-page White Paper. This White Paper will serve as the proposal for teams wishing to participate in the Two-Tiered approach. During Tier One the HBCU/MI shall evaluate the protegees business needs, conduct market research, and produce a business plan to position the Protege to accept the future transfer of the agreed upon technology. During Tier One the Business Plan will be completed and a program review conducted. Teams progressing into Tier Two will be down-selected based on program review analyses. The AF will request an expanded White Paper from those teams demonstrating progress and achievement of the stated goals during Tier One. Tier Two will focus on implementing technology transfer and business infrastructure improvements identified during Tier One. The expanded White Paper will serve as the Tier Two Program Plan and must include a detailed schedule, program goals and expected posture at the end of the program.  Award dates under this initiative may differ from the full and open competition. 

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

	The GSA intends to award contracts with eligible mentors in accordance with the DoD Mentor-Protege Program. The period of performance for the Two-Tiered contract will be six months from date of award for Tier One and 18 months for Tier Two. Offerors shall provide proposed costs and supporting documentation for the 6-month period of performance only.

The Two-Tiered proposals must demonstrate team compatibility and established mutual goals prior to submittal. The Tier One efforts will comprise an in-depth business needs evaluation, market research, and result in a Business Plan to position the Protege to accept the future transfer of more advanced technology. Tier One activities shall focus on preparing the Protege to accept a specific technology, within the identified thrust areas, to be transferred during tier two.

Proposals will be ranked from highest to lowest across all technology areas. Awards will be made starting at the highest rated proposal, descending down in order until all funds have been allocated. The dollar amount of individual awards may vary, however typical Two-Tiered awards are anticipated to be in the $50,000 to $75,000 range for the initial tier period of performance and $175,000 to $200,000 for the second tier period of performance.

Offerors are advised only contracting officers are legally authorized to commit the government to an award under this BAA and each award is subject to availability of funds. The cost of preparing proposals is not an allowable direct charge to any contract award as a result of this announcement; nor is proposal preparation cost allowable on any other contract. Proposal costs, however, may be an allowable indirect expense to the normal bid and proposal (B&P) indirect costs in accordance with FAR 31.205-18.
