<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation intends to award a construction contract to overlay the Deer Creek Dam Spillway Chute with a reinforced concrete slab.  This requirement is being procured in accordance with Part 15 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations as a Request for Proposals. Deer Creek Dam is a zoned earth and rockfill embankment with a strutural height of 235 feet and a crest length of 1,304 feet.  It impounds the 152,700 acre Deer Creek Reservoir, a source of culinary, municipal, and irrigation water for both Salt Lake and Utah Counties.  The dam's 700-foot long reinforced concrete spillway is located on the right abutment and is controlled by two 21-foot wide by 20-foot high radial gates. The principal features of the work include the following: 1.  Construction of a reinforced concrete overlay within the spillway chute. 2.  Installation of grouted anchors and dowels in the chute floor slabs and walls. 3.  Installation of hydrophilic and PVC waterstops at concrete joints. 4.  Preparation of existing concrete surfaces to accept concrete overlay. 5.  Removal of existing concrete at upstream and downstream ends of overlay. 6.  Unwatering spillway chute and stilling basin to allow placement of concrete overlay. 7.  Construct and remove downstream cofferdam.  Cleaning and removal of debris from stilling basin. Critical items of work include placing a large quantity of concrete to strict Reclamation standards, and effectively removing seepage water from the stilling basin.   While Reclamation plans to award the contract in January of 2007, the actual work will be performed between June (immediately following spring runoff) and October of 2007. A site tour will be announced in the solicitation that will be issued on October 19, 2006.  This requirement falls within the estimated price range of $1,000,000 to $5,000,000.  The work will be performed under NAICS Code 238110, and is being solicited under full and open competition.  Please contact Estephanie Singleton (801) 524-3693 or e-mail esingleton@uc.usbr.gov to obtain a CD of the Drawings for this requirement. Prospective vendors must be registered in CCR prior to the award of a contract.  Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award.  Information, Central Contractor Registration Handbook and the registration process can be obtained via the CCR wersite, http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423.

Software and data analysis will be compared between the 3344 model and the larger existing Instron machine. The suggested vendor is the manufacturer and supplier of that existing equipment. Purchasing a different model form the same vendor will allow for interchangeability between the accessories of the two machines. The ability to share accessories will enhance the capabilities of both laboratories. Instron Corp is the only manufacturer that can provide this equipment that will allow compatibility with existing equipment. NASA/KSC intends to purchase these items from Instron Corp. without full and open competition as permitted pursuant to 10 U.S.C, 2304 (c) (1) and/or other authority as appropriate, because the services and/or supplies required are available from only one responsible source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements.

POC Mr. Ray Balcerak, DARPA/MTO, FAX (703) 696-2206

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting research proposals in the area of Micro-Sensors for Imaging. The objective of this effort is to develop technologies for extremely light weight micro-cameras sensitive in the visible to short wave and in longer wave infrared; and to demonstrate such camera systems in micro-vehicles and head mounted applications.  The proposed research should investigate and exploit innovative approaches that will enable revolutionary advances in science, materials, detectors, focal plane arrays, micro-packaging, optics, electronics and signal processing leading to extremely light weight cameras.  Specifically excluded is research, which primarily results in evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice

The primary goal of this program is to establish the micro-systems technology for extremely light weight, low power cameras with the performance necessary for medium to short range applications.  The components comprising the light weight camera include the optics, packaged detector, electronics and camera housing. Innovations in optical and detecting materials; sensor design and fabrication, signal processing, and micro-packaging are necessary to achieve goals for extremely light weight.  

PROGRAM SCOPE   
 	
This program addresses development of sensor technology critical to micro-vehicle and head-mounted system applications, integration of sensor technology into a package consistent with the application, and demonstration of system prototypes.  Micro-air and micro-ground platforms and helmet mounted applications require:  sensor operation at room temperature or with extremely low power cooling and temperature stabilization, sensor micro-package with operational lifetime consistent with military operations, and optics and electronics consistent with the platform.  The first phase of the program shall demonstrate the feasibility of integrating an imaging array into a micro-package of the size and weight necessary for the application and with performance compatible with system goals.  This will include demonstration of the key attributes of the proposed approach, and paths to evaluate the risk.  The measured data shall be supported by models and calculations predicting performance.  Options may be exercised to continue the program after this initial demonstration.  

The second phase will consist of an integrated system feasibility demonstration for the proposed application. 

GENERAL INFORMATION

Proposers must obtain a pamphlet entitled BAA 06-46, Micro-Sensors for Imaging Proposer Information Pamphlet which provides further information on Micro-Sensors for Imaging, the submission, evaluation, and funding processes, proposal abstract formats, proposal formats, and other general information.  This pamphlet may be obtained from the FedBizOpps website: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/, Grants.gov website: www.grants.gov, DARPA website: http://www.darpa.mil/ (go to "solicitations", "MTO"), or by fax, electronic mail, or mail request to the administrative contact address given below.   Proposals not meeting the format described in the pamphlet may not be reviewed.  In order to minimize unnecessary effort in proposal preparation and review, proposers are strongly encouraged to submit proposal abstracts in advance of full proposals.  An original and four (4) copies of the proposal abstract and two electronic copies (i.e., two separate disks) of the abstract (in MS-Word readable (preferred), PDF, HTML, or ASCII format each on a single 3.5 inch High Density MS-DOS formatted 1.44 Megabyte (MB) diskette, a single 100 MB Iomega Zip disk, or a CD-ROM) should be submitted.  Each disk must be clearly labeled with BAA 06-46, proposer organization, proposal title (short title recommended) and Copy __ of 2.  The proposal abstract (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) must be submitted to DARPA/MTO, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn.: BAA 06-46), and it must be received by DARPA on or before 4:00 p.m., local time, November 15, 2006.  Proposal abstracts received after this time and date may not be reviewed.  Upon review, DARPA will provide written feedback on the likelihood of a full proposal being selected and the time and date for submission of a full proposal.  Proposers not submitting proposal abstracts must submit an original and four (4) copies of the full proposal and two electronic copies (i.e., two separate disks) of the full proposal [in MS-Word readable  (preferred), PDF, HTML, or ASCII format, each on a single 3.5 inch High Density MS-DOS formatted 1.44 Megabyte (MB) diskette, a single 100 MB Iomega Zip disk, or a CD-ROM]. Each disk must be clearly labeled with BAA 06-46, proposer organization, proposal title (short title recommended) and Copy __ of 2.  The full proposal (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) must be submitted to DARPA/MTO, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn.: BAA 06-46), and must be received by DARPA on or before 4:00 p.m., local time, January 5, 2007, in order to be considered during the initial round of selections; however, proposals received after this deadline may be received and evaluated up to one year from date of posting on FedBizOpps.  University (prime) grant submissions may be made via the Grants.gov web site, http://www.grants.gov/, by using the "Apply for Grants" funtion. Dual submissions are not required.  Full proposals received after the due date specified in the BAA or due date otherwise specified by DARPA after review of proposal abstracts may be selected contingent upon the availability of funds.  This notice, in conjunction with the BAA 06-46 Proposer Information Pamphlet, constitutes the total BAA.  No additional information is available, nor will a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued. Requests for the same will be disregarded.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received.  All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal which shall be considered by DARPA.  Input on technical aspects of the proposals may be solicited by DARPA from non-Government consultants/experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements.  Non-Government technical consultants/experts will not have access to proposals that are labeled by their offerors as "Government Only".  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research in Micro-Sensors for Imaging.

<DESC>The Safety Hazard Mitigation Branch has immediate requirements for a long-term indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity equipment contract essential to reduce Transportation Security Officer (TSO) lift and carry on-the-job injuries in checked baggage screening areas.  During the last two years, the TSA has sustained the highest on-the-job injury (OJI) rate of any Federal military or civilian agency.  The TSA Assistant Secretary has established the mandate to substantially reduce the high TSA OJI rate as a top agency priority.

These safety-related equipment requirements for non-powered rigid and flexible roller conveyors, ball transfer tables, liftgates and on-site equipment installation are an essential element of the overall agency strategy to reduce the employee OJI rate.  Purchase and installation of this equipment is a key element of a multi-year program to improve TSO baggage screening work area ergonomics at airports by providing modern equipment to help TSOs safely move airline checked baggage between the airport baggage handling equipment and TSA security screening devices.

<CONTACT>Patricia Meise, Purchasing Agent, Phone 410-558-8043, Fax 410-558-8319, Email meisep@grc.nia.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institute on Aging (NIA), IRP, intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis with Dr. Garrick Li, 351 Bonsal  Street, Baltimore, MD 21224 for the following services: maintain and trouble-shoot microscopes and C. elegans incubators at the Laboratory of Experimental Gerontology (LEG); group and individual training of LEG personnel on the methods to perform dietary deprivation (DD) in c. elegans; assist individual LEG scientists and technical personnel in the design of DD studies to ensure the consistent quality of lifespan assay in C. elegans; meet with LEG personnel to review progress, answer questions, and provide expert advice in support of ongoing DD studies; perform genetics screen to identify genes involved in the DD pathway; perform double-stranded RNA interference screen to identify genes involved in the DD pathway; collect and analyze data; prepare samples for microarray experiments to investigate molecular mechanisms by which DD extends lifespan; participate as a co-author in the preparation and submission of manuscripts.   NIA continues to study molecular mechanisms of lifespan extension by the DD paradigm and wishes to contract the expert services of a C. elegans expert.  Specifically, we need this expert to provide ongoing research in the form of training personnel; efficient design of DD studies; equipment maintenance and trouble-shooting; performing DD experiments; quality control/quality assurance; optimization for maximum efficiency, and review/preparation of manuscripts.  This support is critical for the studies of mechanisms of lifespan extension by DD in the worm C. elegans.  Only one responsible source and no other vendors will satisfy agency requirements, 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) FAR 6.302-1(b)(1).  The cited authority is applicable because Dr. Li is the only source that can fulfill the requirements of this contract.  Dr. Garrick Li has expert credentials to meet the requirements for this contract.  He has more than ten years of solid training and experience in biomedical research, and, relevant to this contract, he has more than four years of training and experience in biology of the worm C. elegans.  As a postdoctoral fellow and later as a Special Volunteer at NIA, Dr. Li has developed a unique method to study dietary regulation of lifespan in C. elegans.  This method is the first in the field.  Using this simple but robust method, Dr. Li has identified pathways that are involved in dietary regulation of lifespan.  This work has been accepted for publication in an international scientific journal, Aging Cell, in 2006.  Dr. Li is familiar with protocols in using C. elegans as the model system to study aging related questions.  He has written and published a number of peer-reviewed papers.  A survey of literature in this field shows there are no other sources for these services.   The period of performance for this contract is 12 months and is a small business set-aside.  Proposals will be evaluated on technical expertise, education and price.   The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) is 541990 and the size standard is $6.5 million.   This acquisition is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition procedures and is exempt for the requirements of FAR, Part 6, Competition Requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals however, all responses received, within 10 days form the date of notice will be considered by NIA.  Comments to this announcement, referencing synopsis number LEG004 may be submitted to NIA, 5600 Nathan Shock Drive, GRC Bldg., Room 1E08, Baltimore, MD  21224, Attention: Pat Meise.

<DESC>PEO SHIPS, under the Surface Force Technology Insertion Program, in collaboration with Office of Naval Research, Surface Forces Command, Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA 05 and Carderock), and Naval Air Systems Command is conducting research, development and evaluation programs aimed at providing product improvements or alternatives for non skid coatings used on Naval ships.  Products should be designed to increase capabilities in all areas of non skid coating performance, reliability and maintainability.  This effort will focus on the development of a heat resistant non skid deck system that will withstand high temperatures and cyclic flight deck deformations (i.e., heating and cool-down cycles).  Non skid systems that also provide thermal insulation to the steel flight deck with no loss of non skid performance are highly desirable.  Both traditional coating systems and non-traditional, non-paint methods will be analyzed.   New concepts will be considered as well as use of existing commercial technologies for potential use or modification.  Laboratory screening, down select, and shipboard demonstrations of new technologies will be performed in an effort to qualify a new system for use on Amphibious, Aircraft Carriers, and Surface Combatant ships.  The period of performance will be an eight month base period with two, eight month options. Award will be made in the form of a contract. A solicitation will be issued and posted to the link http://www.onr.navy.mil/02/rfps.htm. A copy of the solicitation will also be attached to this pre-solicitation notice for access through FedBizOpps. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency. NAICS 541710 applies. 

THE PRIMARY POINT OF CONTACT FOR QUESTIONS IS: Darrien Demps, Contracting Officer, e-mail: Darrien_Demps@onr.navy.mil, phone 703-696-2583.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City, FL (NSWC-PC) intends to award a sole source contract to BAE Systems of Greenlawn, NY 11740 for procurement of AN/VRC-99B(C) radios that will be used in the testing and deployment of the AN/WLD-1 (V) 1 Remote Minehunting System. The AN/VRC-99B(C) radio is used as part of the communications subsystem used to control the Remote Minehunting Vehicle (RMV). It is part of the Line-of-Sight (LOS) link hardware that is used to control the RMV at ranges up to 14 nautical miles.  The items being purchased are: Part Name - , Manufacturer Part No. 1051054G-4, Quantity four (4) each with options for the purchase of up to four (4) additional radios.  The AN/VRC-99B(C) radio, manufactured by BAE Systems, was competitively chosen at the beginning of the RMS development program by the prime development contractor and the data link subsystem (DLS) was subsequently designed and tested around it for LOS operations.  This radio is an integrated !  part of the RMS DLS subsystem and is uniquely capable of operating with the existing hardware and software already designed into the system. Specific commands for remote, automatic operation of the radio are incorporated into the existing system, requiring the identical radio for plug-and-play operation. Other radio features that are required for RMS operations include: Embedded encryption approved for SECRET level data transmission, operation in the 1.7 - 2.0 GHz radio frequency band used by the military, data rates up to 3.15 Mbps, and automatic network establishment of at least three radios. There are no other radio(s) currently built that have such features and can operate with RMS off-the-shelf.  This is a follow-on contract for the production of a highly specialized equipment within the exact meaning of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii). Use of any other vendor would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that, given the limited number of items being acquired!  , would not be recovered through competition.  Delivery will be to the  Naval Support Activity - Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018. See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) is tasked to explore, test and evaluate Future Force communications networks and Warfighting technologies. It is the Government's intent to obtain information from interested parties that have the capability to upgrade existing instrumentation to support the future mission needs of testing at the system level and in a Force-on-Force Network Centric Warfare (NCW) environment. It is the intent of PEO STRI to expand on the existing capabilities of the Army's existing Improved Field Data Collector version 4 (IFDC) v4.  Responders must be familiar with the IFDC v4 concept and have the means to grow and expand its current capabilities to support the future mission objectives addressed below:

Task 1. The contractor must develop a National Security Agency (NSA) approved method of upgrading the IFDCv4 to handle classified data up to the Secret level when it is deployed on Army tactical vehicles in a realistic operational testing or training environment, including the ability to network with test control in a secure, distributed environment.

Task 2. Upgrade 74 IFDCv4s using the NSA approved methodology from the Task 1 effort.  

Task 3. Upgrade the 74 existing IFDCv4s with the application of a USB 2.0 interface(s) without degrading any of the IFDCv4's current data collecting interfaces.

Task 4. Develop a separate man pack data collector capable of storing 20 gigabytes of data.  

Task 5. Develop a GIG-E LAN collection capability.

Task 6.  Contractor Technical Support to include on site support, support via telephone, and electronic communication means for the IFDC v4 Upgrade following its delivery.


Task 2 is dependant upon successful completion of Task 1 and availability of funding.  Tasks 3-6 are dependant upon availability of funding and may be established as option CLINs.  At this time, funding in the amount of $1.4M is available upon contract award.    The current strategy is for an anticipated RFP release the week of 16 October 2006 with an anticipated award date on or about 15 December 2006.  A firm-fixed-price contract utilizing Performance Based Payments in accordance with FAR 32.10 is anticipated.  The delivery schedule of the NCW-DBI is anticipated to be no later than 12 months after contract award.  A limited amount of IFDCv4 equipment/boxes will be available as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE).   All applicable data rights clauses will be incorporated into any resultant contract at time of award.  The Government intends to require unlimited data rights.  A DD 254 is applicable to this effort.

<SUBJECT>A -- National Registry of Patients with Marfan Syndrome (Request for Information)

<DESC>The NHLBI plans to release a Request for Proposals for a Clinical and Data Coordinating Center to establish a registry to collect and analyze clinical data and blood and tissue samples of patients with Marfan Syndrome (and other connective tissue disorders associated with aortic disease) in order to improve understanding of cardiovascular complications and therapies for aortic aneurysmal disease and its complications.  Ultimately the registry will provide an essential resource to improve clinical care for patients afflicted with cardiovascular complications of Marfan Syndrome and other genetically-triggered aortic aneurysmal disease. The NHLBI would like information from academic institutions, professional groups and private industries regarding screening, surveillance and treatment of cardiac complications of Marfan Syndrome and other connective tissue disorders associated with aortic aneurysms and or valvular disease in order to identify optimum parameters to establishing a registry and ways to design and implement an effective program.  Specifically, NHLBI seeks advice concerning core information to be collected, concerns and solutions to protect rights of patients, facilities, providers and support teams.  Also important are independence of data analysis, access to data and data sharing, and potential strategies for the registry to become at least partially self-supporting.  Ways to involve private industry without undermining the independence of the program governance are also sought.  Finally, while NHLBI is primarily interested in cardiovascular issues, expansion of the data collected in order to include extra-cardiac manifestations of the connective tissue disorders such as joint disease, craniofacial disorders or others may be possible if there interest and support from other Institutes, and/or private or professional groups.  In 2002, the NHLBI and the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) met with members of the National Marfan Foundation (NMF) at their request.  In follow-up, NHLBI convened a Marfan Working Group in June of 2002.  The registry is considered a critically important initial step to stimulate investigator-initiated research in Marfan Syndrome.  Marfan Syndrome is an autosomal-dominant, inherited connective tissue disorder that is associated with cardiovascular complications, including mitral valve prolapse, aortic aneurysmal and valvular disease, and heart failure.  Premature death for Marfan patients is the result of aortic disease resulting in progressive dilatation of the ascending aorta leading to aortic valve insufficiency, heart failure, and/or aortic rupture. Cardiac surgery to treat thoracic aortic disease has improved survival.  Nevertheless, Marfan patients with progressive aortic disease have a shortened life span.  Treatment for Marfan Syndrome, including cardiac surgery is hampered by the small numbers of patients seen, even at tertiary referral medical centers.  There is a need to evaluate new surgical techniques and emerging strategies to improve clinical outcomes.  Current surgical options include different attendant risks, but they lack independent assessment.  The use of pharmacologic therapies is largely empiric and would benefit from systematic evaluation.  Elucidation of the functional importance of genetic mutations associated with Marfan Syndrome has excellent potential for translation to therapeutic interventions, but is limited by difficulties in obtaining tissues for investigation and identification of kindred families by centers with expertise in genomic applications.  Animal models of Marfan syndrome demonstrate functional significance of genetic mutations and suggest new strategies for therapeutic prevention and treatment.  These findings require confirmation in patients.   A registry with a tissue repository would provide a needed resource for evaluation of disease progression and response to therapy, data for planning appropriate clinical trials, and tissue for genomic investigations, and ultimately facilitate improving treatment for the Marfan patient and possibly other patients with aortic aneurysmal disease.  Marfan Syndrome occurs in all races at a frequency of about 1 per 10,000 persons, and is often undiagnosed in life.  Marfan Syndrome is characterized by cardiovascular, skeletal and ocular disorders, and its cardiovascular complications result in premature death.  In the general population of persons over the age of 65 years, degenerative thoracic and abdominal aortic aneurysmal disease is a common cause of morbidity and mortality.  Rupture almost always results in death, and repair of aortic aneurysm is associated with significant morbidity.  Surgery to repair abdominal aortic aneurysm has significant operative risk for death and substantial morbidity.  Alternate strategies to slow non-Marfan degenerative aneurysms may be facilitated by insights learned about Marfan-related aortic disease which is a genetically triggered.  The connective tissue weakening associated with Marfan Syndrome has common and overlapping pathogenic pathways with degenerative aneurysmal diseases secondary to atherosclerosis and normal aging.  Thus, understanding and therapy for non-Marfan aneurysmal disease may benefit from new knowledge gained through the proposed registry. The registry would provide systematic collection of tissue and clinical data intended to provide information concerning diagnostic evaluation for the disease, complications, and outcomes.  The resultant data base will provide the capacity to evaluate treatments, such as surgical outcomes for aortic valve repair, pharmacologic interventions to reduce progression of aortic root dilatation, complications associated with anticoagulation associated with prosthetic valve, etc.  Specific treatment issues that might be addressed include: 1) Current issues in surgical management of aortic root disease in Marfan Syndrome.  (Timing of replacement surgery, valve sparing techniques, complications of anticoagulation, sex difference in utilization of surgery , etc.);  2) The role of afterload reduction in slowing progression of aortic dilation leading to valve replacement and anticoagulation; and 3) Optimal use of mechanical versus tissue valves.  The registry will support infrastructure to establish a Clinical and Data Coordinating Center, a tissue and blood repository, and a scientific advisory group to develop protocols for standard procedures to collect patient and procedure/treatment data, tissue, and blood samples for genomic and proteomic investigations.  Registry data would be analyzed to permit understanding of clinical outcomes, complications, and associated therapies.  The registry would serve as a resource to encourage research investigations using centrally collected tissue or data, and would provide information critical to the design of clinical investigations or trials of specific therapeutic interventions.  The proposed registry would build on the progress of the existing registries, and facilitate sharing of data without compromising confidentiality of patients or rights of independent investigators.  Participation of patient advocacy or other professional groups with NIH will facilitate access and maximize patient and family participation and the cooperation of their doctors.  NHLBI seeks comments and suggestions as requested below. 1.  Registry will collect a detailed data set in patients with various genetically-triggered cardiovascular complications of the aorta, including aneurysmal disease, valvular disease and heart failure and their treatment.  Patient outcomes are determined by patient characteristics, surgical provider and facilities support, and device performance. Please suggest data elements you consider essential for collection by the registry at the time entry and for follow-up.  2. A repository for blood and tissue is planned.  Please suggest ways to make the repository useful and accessible to investigators interested in advancing the diagnosis and treatment or advance pathophysiologic understanding of aortic aneurysmal disease or other genetically triggered complication of registry patients.  3. There are other registries of aortic aneurysmal disease and patients with connective tissue disorders.  Please suggest ways that the registry might collaborate or coordinate its data collection and analysis with existing registries.  4. Abstracting hospital and out-patient data and checking accuracy of submitted data will be required.  Please provide concerns you have about the registry collecting data on patients, hospitals and medical providers.  Please suggest ways the NHLBI can design registry protocols to minimize those concerns.  5. Please identify ways for NHLBI to encourage industry to participate and support the registry.  6. Because it is not likely that a single center or hospital has sufficient numbers of patients to support costs associated with a dedicated research coordinator, it is anticipated that patients will be recruited through regional centers responsible for specific large geographic areas.

<DESC>The GPO will support the 2010 Census by contracting for the printing, finishing, and distribution (via USPS mail or transport via commercial carriers) of the initial mailout/mailback, update/leave, bilingual, and replacement mailing questionnaire packages. The printing process begins in 2007, when Contractors(s) shall participate in the processes of reviewing and refining specifications for the 2008 Dress Rehearsal (DR) print products, as well as the 2010 Census print products. The Census Bureau will also conduct a dress rehearsal of the printing operations planned for the 2010 Census. The 2008 DR printing will model all work for the larger Print 2010 effort. Final preparations for the 2010 Census will begin in 2008.  The Government expects that over 197 million questionnaire packages will be printed and delivered under the scope of this contract.
For the 2010 Census, the Government has added a new print effort, a ?Replacement Mailing? (RM).  That is, a second mailing will be sent to those housing units that do not respond to the initial mailing.  The Government will require the Contractor(s) to address and mail approximately 40 million RM questionnaire packages within about ten (10) calendar days. The contract shall become effective on the date of award.  All work to be performed shall be issued and awarded by individual task orders.  Each task order shall specify the period of performance to accomplish a specific PWS, as set forth in Section C of the RFP.  It is anticipated that the work detailed in CLIN0001 (Performance Management Operations) will start at contract award [Estimated Date of Award: April 16, 2007] and continue through Contract Closeout [Estimate: November 11, 2010].

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE. NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. BASED ON CAPABILITY STATEMENTS RECEIVED FROM THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE, THIS ACQUISITION MAY BE SOLICITED AS A 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE OR AS FULL AND OPEN.  ALL SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS (SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, VOSB, and SDVOSB) ARE ENCOURAGED TO RESPOND TO THIS NOTICE.  SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS MUST HAVE THEIR SIZE STATUS CERTIFIED BY THE SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION.  THE NAICS CODE IS 541710 WITH A SIZE STANDARD OF 500 EMPLOYEES.               

The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious diseases.     The NIAID, Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID), supports a comprehensive extramural research program focused on the prevention and control of diseases caused by virtually all infectious agents (with the exception of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus).     This includes basic research, such as studies of microbial biology and physiology; applied research, including the development of vaccines, therapeutics and medical diagnostics; as well as clinical studies to evaluate experimental drugs and vaccines.

To build upon the objectives of the NIAID Genomics programs (http://www.niaid.nih.gov/dmid/genomes/) and address the Institute’s need to further expand the knowledge of the proteome, NIAID is looking to establish 2 large scale Structural Genomics Centers for Infectious Diseases that will apply state-of-the art high-throughput (HTP) structural biology technologies to experimentally characterize the three dimensional atomic structure of targeted proteins from pathogens in the NIAID Category A-C priority lists (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/biodefense/bandc_priority.htm) and organisms causing emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. The scope of the Structural Genomics Centers for Infectious Diseases is to create a collection of high quality, experimentally determined three-dimensional structures that is widely available to the scientific community and serves as a blueprint for development of structure-based drugs, vaccines and diagnostics for infectious diseases. The three dimensional structure of proteins can assist drug design and development by yielding direct insights into the target molecular mechanisms, in interaction with other biological molecules, or with synthetic compounds, in order to improve selectivity, specificity and optimize drug development in a rational way.  

The primary focus of the Structural Genomics Centers shall be pathogen targets that are expected to have an important biological role and a potential impact on biomedical research, such as: 

Proteins involved in pathogenesis, such as invasins, adhesions, toxins; Proteins essential to the pathogen’s life and reproductive cycle; Proteins involved in antimicrobial/drug resistance; Protein markers of acute or chronic infection; Complexes with natural substrates, cofactors, receptors, drug candidates; Protein splice variants, post-translational modifications and other functionally characterized variants.

HTP structure determination is a complex scientific and technical process that includes target selection, cloning, expression and purification, sample preparation for X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, X-ray and NMR data collection, structure solution and validation. Pathogen targets shall be proposed by external investigators, NIH, other Government agencies, and the Contractor. The Contractor is expected to provide NIAID with established operational facilities, infrastructure, and scientific and technical expertise to perform in a HTP manner every component of the protein structure determination process. 

The Center shall provide to the broad scientific community by making available its technologies, resources and staff expertise to determine the structure of targets and deposit that information into the public domain. The Center must maintain productivity, quality and costs for structure determination that are competitive with those of similar HTP Structural Genomics Centers,  such as the Large-Scale Centers funded by the NIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) under the second phase of the Protein Structure Initiative (PSI-2) http://www.nigms.nih.gov/Initiatives/PSI/. NIAID is committed to release into the public domain the results of the structural genomics projects in a timely fashion. It is anticipated that the Contractor will follow the guidelines established by the NIGMS-PSI large scale Centers for structural genomics. Those guidelines currently state that the atomic coordinates of the three-dimensional structure of biological macromolecules and associated data shall be deposited and released into the public domain within 4 weeks from completion of the structure determination project.

The Government anticipates multiple awards.  It is anticipated that the duration of the contracts will be a maximum of five (5) years; however, the length of time for which funding is requested should be consistent with the nature and complexity of the proposed research.  

Small business and 8(a) contractors are reminded that in order to quality as a set-aside, 51% of the direct labor must be performed by the prime contractor.  It is anticipated that an anticipated total effort of approximately 29.75 FTEs will be needed to accomplish this project. Interested organizations should submit three (3) copies of their capability statement addressing each of the areas cited above.  Interested organizations presenting a capability statement in response to this sources sought announcement must identify their size status.  Written capability statements should be received by the NIAID Contracting Officer by July 21, 2006.  Please reference the solicitation number on all related correspondence.  No collect calls or facsimiles will be accepted. E-mail transmissions will be accepted.  Any proprietary information should be so marked.  See Government-wide numbered note 25.

Maintenance also includes replacement parts and / or systems for both domestic and overseas DoD sites to be provided within 24 or 48 hours, respectively, of the diagnosis and validation of system failure.  The additional maintenance year option will be exercised at the Government's discretion.   The intent of this pre-solicitation notice is to allow interested parties the opportunity to submit capability statements that could lead to a competitive bidding process.  No solicitation document exists.  Any firm that believes it can provide the stated capability is invited to submit written notification to the Contracting Officer by 4:00 p.m. on Oct 20, 2006.

<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS for information regarding alternative non-skid technologies.  No proposals are being or accepted with this synopsis—this does not preclude the Government from considering procurement of materials, equipment, or services as a result of the information provided in response to this request.  The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) seeks participation and information from private industry, academia, and government entities concerning alternative technologies to replace current coating systems for non-skid applications on U.S. Navy Ships—these applications include, for example, aviation decks, weather decks, and interior decks.  Alternative technologies sought must be capable of providing durability that meets or exceeds current requirements for a Type V, Composition G or L as defined in MIL-PRF-24667B, which is available at the following web location: http://portal.nstcenter.com/default.aspx?RootFolder=%2fDocument%20Library%2fMilitary%20Spe!  cifications%2f24667&View=%7bFB35FA95%2d6E67%2d4E1F%2d9184%2dAE73C35B0508%7d).  The alternative non-skid material, for certain applications, should also comply with Type IX requirements for heat resistance.  Current heat requirements are 400 degrees Fahrenheit for 90 minutes; this temperature limit is anticipated to increase, between 600 to 700 degrees Fahrenheit, to accommodate the next generation of aircraft.  Based on information provided, the Government may request to perform limited testing at a Government laboratory as a pre-screening to determine if further consideration and evaluation are desired.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and potential technical capability of small business firms as defined by NAICS Code 54170 to perform as a Clinical Coordinating Center.  The overall objectives of this research are to utilize the prospective study design to identify risk factors playing a protective or harmful role for cardiovascular and lung disease and sleep disorders in Hispanic populations, and to determine the role of acculturation in the prevalence and development of these diseases.  Longitudinal cohort studies in Hispanic populations will provide the data necessary to develop prevention programs for disease in the Hispanics as well as the entire US population. 

To achieve these objectives the study will identify four geographical areas in the US of persons of Hispanic origin with stable population and strong community structure and organization representing the major Hispanic groups in the U.S. (Mexican-American, Cuban, Puerto Rican, Central/South American).  Each area will have a field center which will identify, sample and recruit up to 4000 persons of Hispanic origin from each of areas for participation in a longitudinal study of cardiovascular and lung diseases (up to 16,000  persons).  The field centers will each conduct a detailed examination of these study participants including fasting blood draw, questionnaires, and other procedures and will conduct an annual contact, consisting of a brief questionnaire, of these persons following the initial examination.  The field centers will also identify new coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) events that have occurred following the initial examination, will identify acute exacerbations of asthma requiring ER care or hospitalization, and will review and adjudicate medical information from hospital, physician and other records.   Finally study investigators will develop innovative hypotheses, perform data analysis, and produce publications from this study; provide community education and feedback regarding information from the study itself;  provide information to improve the health of the communities in general; provide training for minority investigators; and provide opportunities for ancillary studies funded by other mechanisms by establishing collaborations and publicizing the potential for these opportunities.  

Necessary functions of the Clinical Coordinating Center will include active participation in the development of the study protocol and pilot testing procedures;  leadership in organizing and conducting the centralized training and certification of study personnel; design and implementation of data collection procedures; design, implementation and maintenance of quality control procedures including assessment of reproducibility, validity, bias and drift in laboratory measurements in this study with 4 field centers; design of forms (including informed consent documents), Manuals of Operation, data entry and recruitment tracking computer programs, data bases and web sites for use by all Centers participating in the study; generation and enhancement of applications of appropriate statistical methods of analysis and presentation of data collected during the study; leadership in manuscript writing and publication; and establishment and maintenance of subcontracts to laboratories and reading centers.  

Capability statements should demonstrate: 1) professional qualifications of scientific, managerial and technical personnel including medical, technical, statistical, computer, and administrative staff with relevant expertise in epidemiologic research;  2) the organizational flexibility to modify the labor mix to meet the changing demand on the resource;  3) evidence of prior administrative and scientific leadership as a multi-center epidemiology study coordinating center managing a study of this size (up to 16,000 participants);  4) evidence of leadership in first-authoring and publishing scientific papers in a collaborative study; 5) experience and expertise in design, implementation and maintenance of quality control procedures including assessment of reproducibility, validity, and bias and drift in laboratory measurements in large multi-center studies; 6) substantial experience pertinent to the development of protocols and management of a wide variety of large-scale multi-center epidemiology studies; 7) experience and expertise in the epidemiology of cardiovascular and lung diseases, and sleep disorders; 8) clinical expertise to determine appropriate levels for participant alerts and referrals, and actions required for participant safety; 9) experience in generation and enhancement of applications of appropriate statistical methods of analysis and interpretation of medical data; 10) access to a large capacity computer facility and networking to remote terminals, and experience in installing and maintaining such networks; 11) capability to subcontract to laboratories and reading centers; and 12) the firm?s status as a small business under NAICS Code 541710.  This is not a Request for Proposal.  The Government is not responsible for costs associated with preparing capability statements in response to this announcement.  Three copies of the material requested above should be submitted within 15 calendar days from the date of this publication.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE. NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. BASED ON CAPABILITY STATEMENTS RECEIVED FROM THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE, THIS ACQUISITION MAY BE SOLICITED AS A 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE OR AS FULL AND OPEN.  ALL SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS (SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, VOSB, and SDVOSB) ARE ENCOURAGED TO RESPOND TO THIS NOTICE.  SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS MUST HAVE THEIR SIZE STATUS CERTIFIED BY THE SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION.  THE NAICS CODE IS 541710 WITH A SIZE STANDARD OF 500 EMPLOYEES.               

The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious diseases.     The NIAID, Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID), supports a comprehensive extramural research program focused on the prevention and control of diseases caused by virtually all infectious agents (with the exception of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus).     This includes basic research, such as studies of microbial biology and physiology; applied research, including the development of vaccines, therapeutics and medical diagnostics; as well as clinical studies to evaluate experimental drugs and vaccines.

To build upon the objectives of the NIAID Genomics programs (http://www.niaid.nih.gov/dmid/genomes/) and address the Institute’s need to further expand the knowledge of the proteome, NIAID is looking to establish 2 large scale Structural Genomics Centers for Infectious Diseases that will apply state-of-the art high-throughput (HTP) structural biology technologies to experimentally characterize the three dimensional atomic structure of targeted proteins from pathogens in the NIAID Category A-C priority lists (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/biodefense/bandc_priority.htm) and organisms causing emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. The scope of the Structural Genomics Centers for Infectious Diseases is to create a collection of high quality, experimentally determined three-dimensional structures that is widely available to the scientific community and serves as a blueprint for development of structure-based drugs, vaccines and diagnostics for infectious diseases. The three dimensional structure of proteins can assist drug design and development by yielding direct insights into the target molecular mechanisms, in interaction with other biological molecules, or with synthetic compounds, in order to improve selectivity, specificity and optimize drug development in a rational way.  

The primary focus of the Structural Genomics Centers shall be pathogen targets that are expected to have an important biological role and a potential impact on biomedical research, such as: 

Proteins involved in pathogenesis, such as invasins, adhesions, toxins;

Proteins essential to the pathogen’s life and reproductive cycle;

Proteins involved in antimicrobial/drug resistance;

Protein markers of acute or chronic infection;

Complexes with natural substrates, cofactors, receptors, drug candidates;

Protein splice variants, post-translational modifications and other functionally characterized variants.

HTP structure determination is a complex scientific and technical process that includes target selection, cloning, expression and purification, sample preparation for X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, X-ray and NMR data collection, structure solution and validation. Pathogen targets shall be proposed by external investigators, NIH, other Government agencies, and the Contractor. The Contractor is expected to provide NIAID with established operational facilities, infrastructure, and scientific and technical expertise to perform in a HTP manner every component of the protein structure determination process. 

The Center shall provide to the broad scientific community by making available its technologies, resources and staff expertise to determine the structure of targets and deposit that information into the public domain. The Center must maintain productivity, quality and costs for structure determination that are competitive with those of similar HTP Structural Genomics Centers,  such as the Large-Scale Centers funded by the NIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) under the second phase of the Protein Structure Initiative (PSI-2) http://www.nigms.nih.gov/Initiatives/PSI/. NIAID is committed to release into the public domain the results of the structural genomics projects in a timely fashion. It is anticipated that the Contractor will follow the guidelines established by the NIGMS-PSI large scale Centers for structural genomics. Those guidelines currently state that the atomic coordinates of the three-dimensional structure of biological macromolecules and associated data shall be deposited and released into the public domain within 4 weeks from completion of the structure determination project.

The Government anticipates multiple awards.  It is anticipated that the duration of the contracts will be a maximum of five (5) years; however, the length of time for which funding is requested should be consistent with the nature and complexity of the proposed research.  

Small business and 8(a) contractors are reminded that in order to quality as a set-aside, 51% of the direct labor must be performed by the prime contractor.  It is anticipated that an anticipated total effort of approximately 29.75 FTEs will be needed to accomplish this project. Interested organizations should submit three (3) copies of their capability statement addressing each of the areas cited above.  Interested organizations presenting a capability statement in response to this sources sought announcement must identify their size status.  Written capability statements should be received by the NIAID Contracting Officer by July 21, 2006.  Please reference the solicitation number on all related correspondence.  No collect calls or facsimiles will be accepted. E-mail transmissions will be accepted.  Any proprietary information should be so marked.  See Government-wide numbered note 25.

Requirements: The Air Force requires advanced technologies that facilitate the conduct of contingency base operations, combat support functions, and force protection in both homeland security and Air Expeditionary Forces (AEF) operations.  In addition, the Air Force is looking for opportunities to reduce weight, volume, and costs of base emergency response, infrastructure support, and combat support systems.

AFRL/MLQ solicits cutting edge proposals in the following general technology areas:

Atmospheric Threat Protection - Identify characteristic emissions or patterns that enable detection, identification, and/or modeling of anthropogenic chemicals in or transported through the atmosphere.  Develop and/or evaluate methods or technologies enabling localization and/or identification of these emission sources, for example storage, use, or accidental/deliberate release of toxic chemicals.  Develop and/or evaluate methods or technologies enabling prediction of reactive chemical transport through the atmosphere.  Develop, evaluate, modify, and/or integrate technologies and/or materials that may provide protection from atmospheric threats, either inside or adjacent to forward operating bases, and that may contribute to reducing or eliminating threats to personnel and equipment.  Specific areas of interest include laboratory/outdoor chamber studies for validation of atmospheric chemistry models; experimental studies to determine the effect of aerosols on chemical transport in the atmosphere; novel coatings and/or additives that enhance the chemical barrier properties of  polymeric coatings against toxic chemical permeation.

Protective Technologies - Develop chemical processes and passive or self-decontaminating materials that will reduce recovery time and provide a significant improvement in decontamination capabilities.

<DESC>(i) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial supplies prepared in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 12.6 Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items and FAR 13.106 Soliciting Competition, Evaluation of Quotations or Offers, Award and Documentation. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This combined synopsis/solicitation will result in a firm fixed price commercial supply contract.  (ii) Simplified procurement procedures will be used for this acquisition per Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13.  This requirement is being issued as an unrestricted full and open competition; therefore, any responsible business may submit an offer.  (iii) This requirement is for the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN), an association of Veterinary Diagnostic labs which have been authorized by the USDA APHIS Veterinary Services to perform certain diagnostic tests for VS surveillance programs and in the event of a disease outbreak. (iv) This combined synopsis/solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  (v) The provisions and clauses incorporated into this solicitation document are those in effect at the time of publication.  Provisions and clauses incorporated by reference have the same force and effect as if they were given in full text.  The full text of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) can be accessed on the Internet at http://www.arnet.gov/far/ (vi) REQUIREMENT AND QUANTITIES: This requirement consists of three line items:  
CLIN 01  - Seven (7) Magnetic Particle Processors for 96-well plate DNA/RNA Extraction and the complete equipment components for each piece of equipment to perform the processes described below in section (x) CLIN 02  Shipping of the equipment to the FOB destination.  CLIN 03  Travel to the sites to install and start up the equipment as well as train the staff on the use of the equipment. Travel costs will be reimbursed at the rates provided in the Federal Travel or Joint Federal Travel Regulations and travel must be in accordance with Federal Government Travel Regulations.   (vii) This equipment will be distributed to multiple laboratory locations within the United States to enhance the diagnostic testing capacity of the National Animal Health Laboratory Network.  It may be requested that the equipment be delivered to separate NAHLN laboratory locations, depending on the timeframe of delivery.  The selected manufacturer must be able to deliver all requested systems within three (3) months of order placement.  Deliverables and acceptance of deliverables will be FOB destination.  The destinations for all 7 magnetic particle processors are to be determined at a later date.  Exact destinations for the deliverables will be provided by the end of September. (viii) The PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE for this contract is from date of award through delivery of all the equipment. The contractor shall provide delivery of all equipment no later than November 30, 2006. (ix) OBJECTIVES: The diagnostic tests performed by the NAHLN have been validated for specific pieces of laboratory equipment and sets of diagnostic reagents.  The NAHLN laboratories are expected to only perform the diagnostic tests according to the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) that outline the type of equipment and reagents to use.  The current goal of the NAHLN is to increase diagnostic testing capacity and capability for Foreign Animal Diseases (FADs) to enhance veterinary diagnostic preparedness in the event of a FAD outbreak in domestic livestock or poultry.  With the elevated national concern and apprehension of the introduction of highly pathogenic Avian Influenza into the United States, the NAHLN has been directed by the USDA to double the current diagnostic testing capacity for the real time RT-PCR (real time Reverse-Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction) assay.  The NAHLN will accomplish this goal by providing laboratory equipment to approved NAHLN laboratories that increase the platform for the real time RT-PCR assay from single wells to 96 well plates.  One specific piece of necessary equipment is a magnetic particle processor capable of automatically performing the sample preparation steps of DNA/RNA (Ribonucleic Acid) extraction in the 96 well plate format. This statement of work is to define a semi-automated system for performing the 96 well plate platform viral RNA extraction method on the Avian Influenza real time RT-PCR assay.  Although this process can be accomplished manually, it is more efficient for the laboratory performing this assay if a piece of laboratory equipment performs the steps of this extraction process.  (x) TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:  Each magnetic particle processor must meet the following technical specifications in order to be technically acceptable. 
Because the approved extraction kit for the 96 well plate uses the Ambion-R MagMAXtm paramagnetic beads, the selected equipment must be a magnetic particle processor. Must be able to process Ambion-R MagMAXtm paramagnetic beads included in the AI/ND Viral RNA Isolation Kit.
Must be able to utilize a 96-well microplate for PCR applications
Must allow processing through a minimum of 5 reagents (lysis, purification, elution, etc.)
Must allow software programming functionality for multiple protocols and multiple processing steps in each protocol including: incubation, capture / collection of paramagnetic beads, washing with rinse solution, elution of purified material from magnetic beads, and transfer of purified material into 96-well PCR amplification plate.
Must be able to shake/agitate contents of each well during incubation 
Software must be compatible with Microsoft XP operating system
Must achieve at least 90% collection recovery of the magnetic particles in each well at each process step
Must not allow carry over of reagents from plate to plate or cross contamination of beads from well to well.
Must be able to process one plate of 96 samples through the complete procedure in 30 - 45 minutes. 
Must have a 1 year warranty for all parts, labor, travel and include installation, start up training, and support for validated applications.  The contractor must include in their services, travel to the sites to install and start up the equipment and train the staff on the use of the equipment. 
The magnetic particle processor must be able to manipulate multiple 96 well plates filled with different reagent solutions so that the paramagnetic beads (with viral RNA bound to them) can be lifted from one reagent plate to another.  There can be no mixing of materials (reagents or beads) from one well to another on the same plate.  This is typically accomplished with a magnetic particle processor head that contains 96 magnetic rods.   Therefore a separate magnetic rod will contact each separate well on the 96 well plate. In addition to the technical specifications described above, the magnetic particle processor must be able to perform the following protocols are listed here: (a) insert a protective covering over each of the magnetic rods i.e. plastic tip cover; (b) allow for the 96 well initial sample plate to be loaded into the equipment; (c) allow a 4 minute incubation and gentle mixing cycle for the initial sample plate with lysis buffer, magnetic beads, and diagnostic samples to allow viral RNA binding - total well volume of 171ul; (d) collect the beads from each well from the initial viral RNA binding step and allow 2 minutes for capture;  (d) transfer and release the beads into to a plate with the wash solution I and allow to incubate and gently mix for 30 seconds - total well volume of 100ul; (e) collect the beads from each well from the wash solution I step and allow 1 minute for capture;    (f) transfer and release the beads into a plate with wash solution II and allow to incubate and gently mix for 30 seconds - total well volume of 100ul; (g) collect the beads from each well from the wash solution II step and allow 1 minute for capture; (h) transfer and release the beads into a second plate with wash solution II and allow to incubate and gently mix for 30 seconds - total well volume of 100ul; (i) collect the beads from each well from the second wash solution II step and allow 1 minute for capture; (j) allow the beads to dry for 2-5 minutes by shaking in open air; (k) transfer and release the beads into a final plate with the elution buffer solution and allow to incubate with gentle mixing for 4 minutes - total well volume of 50ul; (l) collect the beads from each well from the final elution step and allow 2 minutes for capture; (m) discard the beads and protective magnetic rod coverings into a separate container.  (xi) The provision at 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors - Commercial applies to this solicitation.  (xii) The provision at 52.212-2  Evaluation - Commercial Items applies to this solicitation.  Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to this combined synopsis/solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. A trade off process will be used to evaluate quotes. The Government intends to evaluate offers and award without discussion, however, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions later if determined necessary by the Contracting Officer.

Proposals must be in accordance with the format described in FAR subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This notice/announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and no other written solicitation will be issued.

Solicitation N68335-06-R-0025 is issued as an RFP. This is a 100% Small Business Set-Aside.   This document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through FAC 2005-09.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 335129, Federal Supply Class (FSC) Code 6230, Small Business Size 500.    

The Government may award multiple contracts from this solicitation using the procedures in FAR Parts 12 and 13.  Firm Fixed Price Contract with five (5) options (See Section B).  Options may be exercised in whole or in part.   Inspection and acceptance shall be at Destination.  Shipping shall be F.O.B Destination, Lakehurst, New Jersey.  Contractor is requested to provide their best delivery schedule.  Payment will be made by the appropriate DFAS finance center upon delivery of the items.

The NAVAIR Expeditionary Airfield (EAF) Team seeks to acquire new airfield lighting components to satisfy  the United States Marine Corps (USMC) requirement for a Man-Portable suite of equipment.  It is desired that these components be simple to operate, be small and lightweight, take maximum advantage of Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) technologies, and require a minimum of logistics support.

For the purpose of this specification, the term “light” shall be understood as the item capable of producing visual and infrared (IR) energy.  The term “accessories” refers to any additional component or components that may be needed, at no specific time, to augment the installation and/or control of the light.

A.	Minimum Requirements.  The following parameters must be met to satisfy the needs of the US Marine Corps:

	1.	General.  Light shall be “universal” and capable of supporting runway edge, taxiway edge, runway threshold and runway approach lighting applications.  Light shall be wireless, and operate from a commercially available primary battery.  The light shall make use of light emitting diode or other solid state source(s), and be capable of producing white, red, green, blue, and IR output.  A clear lens shall be employed to protect the light/IR source(s) and provide the required optical coverage.  The light shall produce a steady output and have the means to manually switch between “off”, each color, and IR.

	2.	Color Output.  Light shall be capable of producing individual colors falling within the specified limits for the following designations in accordance with SAE AS25050:
			“Aviation White”
			“Aviation Green”
			“Aviation Red”
			“Aviation Blue”

	3.	Infrared Output.  A high degree of perceptibility by Generation 3+ Night Vision Devices (NVDs) with low visual (naked eye) observability is required.  The infrared output shall have a peak emission and/or centroid wavelength between 850 and 900 nanometers.  The half-power bandwidth of the infrared output shall be as narrow as possible to minimize visibility to the naked eye, while still maintaining the desired acquisition distance stated later in this specification.  Radiometric data may be measured to quantify and empirically compare differences otherwise deemed subjective in nature.

	4.	Flashing Capability.  Light shall be capable of being set to produce a flashing output for each color and infrared.  Flash rate shall be 80 flashes per minute (+/- 5 fpm) with a nominal 50% duty cycle.

	5.	Output Intensity.  Color/IR output from the light shall be visible as follows:
			WHITE - Visible at a distance of 2 nautical miles at night (with naked eye).
			GREEN - Visible at a distance of 1 nautical mile at night (with naked eye).
			RED - Visible at a distance of 1 nautical mile at night (with naked eye).
			BLUE - Visible at a distance of 2000 feet at night (with naked eye).
		 INFRARED - Visible at a distance of 2 nautical miles at night through Generation 3+ NVDs; and not visible beyond 10 feet with naked eye.

	6.	Output Coverage.  Output shall be produced from 0 to +90 degrees in the vertical plane, and at all radials throughout an omni-directional 360 degrees.  Maximum output intensity, allowing the acquisition ranges stated previously, shall be maintained through a vertical beam spread covering no less than the portion between +2 and +10 degrees in the vertical plane.

	7.	Operational Endurance.  Light shall be capable of providing a steady output for a minimum of 10 hours from a fresh battery supply.

8.	Remote Control.  Light shall be capable of being fitted to a wireless, radio frequency remote control receiver allowing for on/off control of the fixture.

	9.	Mounting.  Light shall be capable of being fitted to a separate mounting base.  Mounting base shall be capable of being secured to surfaces including, but not limited to: routine/hard soil, asphalt, rock, coral, concrete, and various types of airfield surfacing materials (matting).  Attaching hardware for securing the fixture to such surfaces will be determined and sourced separately by NAVAIR Lakehurst.  Mounting base shall be retrievable, and possess a means to positively lock the light to the base.  Mounting base shall permit the light to be aimed at various positions, ranging from, and including, full horizontal (flat) to full vertical (standing).

(viii) The PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE for this contract is from date of award through delivery of all the equipment. The contractor shall provide delivery of all equipment no later than November 30, 2006. (ix) OBJECTIVES: The diagnostic tests performed by the NAHLN have been validated for specific pieces of laboratory equipment and sets of diagnostic reagents.  The NAHLN laboratories are expected to only perform the diagnostic tests according to the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) that outline the type of equipment and reagents to use.  The current goal of the NAHLN is to increase diagnostic testing capacity and capability for Foreign Animal Diseases (FADs) to enhance veterinary diagnostic preparedness in the event of a FAD outbreak in domestic livestock or poultry.  With the elevated national concanscriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction) assay.  The NAHLN will accomplish this goal by providing laboratory equipment to approved NAHLN laboratories that increase the platform for the real time RT-PCR assay from single wells to 96 well plates.  One specific piece of necessary equipment is a magnetic particle processor capable of automatically performing the sample preparation steps of DNA/RNA (Ribonucleic Acid) extraction in the 96 well plate format. This statement of work is to define a semi-automated system for performing the 96 well plate platform viral RNA extraction method on the Avian Influenza real time RT-PCR assay.  Although this process can be accomplished manually, it is more efficient for the laboratory performing this assay if a piece of laboratory equipment performs the steps of this extraction process.  (x) TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:  Each magnetic particle processor must meet the following technical specifications in order to be technically acceptable. 
?	Because the approved extraction kit for the 96 well plate uses the AmbionR MagMAXtm paramagnetic beads, the selected equipment must be a magnetic particle processor.
?	Must be able to process AmbionR MagMAZtm paramagnetic beads included in the AI/ND Viral RNA Isolation Kit
?	Must be able to utilize a 96-well microplate for PCR applications
?	Must allow processing through a minimum of 5 reagents (lysis, purification, elution, etc.)
?	Must allow software programming functionality for multiple protocols and multiple processing steps in each protocol including: incubation, capture / collection of paramagnetic beads, washing with rinse solution, elution of purified material from magnetic beads, and transfer of purified material into 96-well PCR amplification plate.
?	Must be able to shake/agitate contents of each well during incubation 
?	Software must be compatible with Microsoft XP operating system
?	Must achieve at least 90% collection recovery of the magnetic particles in each well at each process step
?	Must not allow carry over of reagents from plate to plate or cross contamination of beads from well to well.
?	Must be able to process one plate of 96 samples through the complete procedure in 30 - 45 minutes.

Although this process can be accomplished manually, it is more efficient for the laboratory performing this assay if a piece of laboratory equipment performs the steps of this extraction process.  (x) TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:  Each magnetic particle processor must meet the following technical specifications in order to be technically acceptable. 
?	Because the approved extraction kit for the 96 well plate uses the AmbionR MagMAXtm paramagnetic beads, the selected equipment must be a magnetic particle processor.
?	Must be able to process AmbionR MagMAtm paramagnetic beads included in the AI/ND Viral RNA Isolation Kit
?	Must be able to utilize a 96-well microplate for PCR applications
?	Must allow processing through a minimum of 5 reagents (lysis, purification, elution, etc.)
?	Must allow software programming functionality for multiple protocols and multiple processing steps in each protocol including: incubation, capture / collection of paramagnetic beads, washing with rinse solution, elution of purified material from magnetic beads, and transfer of purified material into 96-well PCR amplification plate.
?	Must be able to shake/agitate contents of each well during incubation 
?	Software must be compatible with Microsoft XP operating system
?	Must achieve at least 90% collection recovery of the magnetic particles in each well at each process step
?	Must not allow carry over of reagents from plate to plate or cross contamination of beads from well to well.
?	Must be able to process one plate of 96 samples through the complete procedure in 30 - 45 minutes. 
?	Must have a 1year warranty for all parts, labor, travel and include installation, start up training, and support for validated applications.  The contractor must include in their services, travel to the sites to install and start up the equipment and train the staff on the use of the equipment. 
?	The magnetic particle processor must be able to manipulate multiple 96 well plates filled with different reagent solutions so that the paramagnetic beads (with viral RNA bound to them) can be lifted from one reagent plate to another.  There can be no mixing of materials (reagents or beads) from one well to another on the same plate.  This is typically accomplished with a magnetic particle processor head that contains 96 magnetic rods.   Therefore a separate magnetic rod will contact each separate well on the 96 well plate.
In addition to the technical specifications described above, the magnetic particle processor must be able to perform the following protocols are listed here: (a) insert a protective covering over each of the magnetic rods i.e. plastic tip cover; (b) allow for the 96 well initial sample plate to be loaded into the equipment; (c) allow a 4 minute incubation and gentle mixing cycle for the initial sample plate with lysis buffer, magnetic beads, and diagnostic samples to allow viral RNA binding ? total well volume of 171ul; (d) collect the beads from each well from the initial viral RNA binding step and allow 2 minutes for capture;  (d) transfer and release the beads into to a plate with the wash solution I and allow to incubate and gently mix for 30 seconds ? total well volume of 100ul; (e) collect the beads from each well from the wash solution I step and allow 1 minute for capture;    (f) transfer and release the beads into a plate with wash solution II and allow to incubate and gently mix for 30 seconds ? total well volume of 100ul; (g) collect the beads from each well from the wash solution II step and allow 1 minute for capture; (h) transfer and release the beads into a second plate with wash solution II and allow to incubate and gently mix for 30 seconds ? total well volume of 100ul; (i) collect the beads from each well from the second wash solution II step and allow 1 minute for capture; (j) allow the beads to dry for 2-5 minutes by shaking in open air; (k) transfer and release the beads into a final plate with the elution buffer solution and allow to incubate with gentle mixing for 4 minutes ? total well volume of 50ul; (l) collect the beads from each well from the final elution step and allow 2 minutes for capture; (m) discard the beads and protective magnetic rod coverings into a separate container.

Question:

Are all five crewmembers completely wireless or are any tethered with cables?   

Answer:

The specified Crew Communication System (CCS) should be a completely wireless system.  The tether connects the coxswain position to the VHF-FM radios at the steering stations.

Question:

Is the coxswain one of the five wireless or is this headset hard-wired (with break-away connectors) into the intercom?  

Answer:

The coxswain shall have the same wireless crew communications system as the other four crew members but also have the capability to connect to the VHF-FM radios via a break free tether.

Question:

How is the radio select (between the 2 identified radios) accomplished? 
        Location? 
        Method?

Answer:
We expect the vendor to provide the solution.

Question:
Can you provide clarification for the Steering Station? What is the steering station? 
Answer:

The 47FT MLB has four steering stations—two each on the open bridge and enclosed bridge.  Steering Stations are the location on the MLB from which we steer the boat.

Question:

If the steering station needs a breakaway connector and length of the cable connection shall be sufficient to allow the operator to use either steering station on the open bridge, how is it wireless?

Answer:

The breakaway tether is only intended for VHF-FM radio connectivity.  The crew communications system is wireless.
Question:
Are all references to the steering station in the open bridge?

<DESC>13. "The CCS shall be capable of being shipped via common carrier without special handling or packaging. The system, including the batteries, shall not need to be classified as hazardous material per 49 CFR Part 173."

This requirement, if strictly interpreted, will effectively preclude the use of Lithium ion batteries in the portable units, thereby increasing their weight and substantially reducing
the available battery run time.

It is also likely to increase the cost of the system significantly.

To meet the above solicitation requirement, is it acceptable to ship the portable units individually, and to impose the requirement that the boxes be labeled in accordance with
existing regulations? Further, can the definition of "shipping" be limited to common carriers within the US and its possessions, since international requirements for Lithium ion batteries are much more strict than US requirements?

Answer: Our interpretation of 49 CFR Part 173 is that rechargeable lithium ion batteries are not hazardous material and do not warrant special handling or packaging. Shipping is defined at the continental United States and it's territories.

<DESC>This amendment provides for more detail to the original posting of the requirements on 28 April 2006.  Operation of the 47-foot Motor Lifeboat (MLB) creates noise environments that impede normal conversational voice. Crewmembers must alter normal routine, move close to each other and shout or yell in each other's ears to communicate. This altered routine in conjunction with yelling to communicate causes a fatiguing and potentially hazardous environment to work in. The boat’s coxswain, using installed communications equipment, can not, in all instances, communicate to land based stations; operational commanders; other boats; ships or aircraft while operating the boat throughout its designed operational parameters because of engine and weather induced noise.
All 47 foot MLB crewmembers must have the capability to communicate to one another during all aspects of missions assigned to this platform.  The boat’s coxswain must have the additional capability to communicate to land based stations; operational commanders; other boats; ships and aircraft that may be encountered in the performance of assigned missions.  The capability for all crewmembers shall be clear unimpeded normal conversational voice.  The crew communication system (CCS) must be able to be used throughout the entire vessel.  The 47 foot MLB CCS boat set consists of a base unit and equipment to support a minimum of 5 portable/remote wireless operator positions, a portable/remote unit charger, and the ability to interface with the installed VHF-FM radios at two steering stations.  Variations of this system may also be used for other aluminum boats within the United States Coast Guard inventory.  A boat set for other aluminum boats would consist of 2 portable/remote units and not require a base unit.  

Constraints:
Extreme Weather Conditions:  The CCS must be functional when exposed to temperatures between (0 - 120 degrees F) and high humidity (up to 99% non-condensing)

Interfaces to External Systems:  
The CCS must interface with the already installed radio equipment to allow the boat coxswain the ability to use a single headset and microphone for both systems.  The CCS must be able to be integrated with at least 2 separate radios.  Only one radio shall be connected to the system at any time. The system shall be capable of being connected to any of the following models of radios:

Motorola Spectra
Motorola Astro Spectra
Motorola Astro Spectra Plus 
Motorola XTL5000
Motorola Astro Saber R1, 
Motorola Astro XTS-3000R
Motorola Astro XTS-5000R

Concept of Operations:
The CCS will allow the crew of the 47 foot MLB to communicate with each other over the noise of the engine and the weather (wind, sea, rain, etc).  The CCS will be able to be used on both the open bridge and the enclosed bridge of the 47 foot MLB and will also allow the crew to communicate with each other during various routine boat evolutions (i.e., moorings, boat rounds, helo ops, gunnery exercises).  The coxswain shall also be able to use the CCS to communicate with other mariners and shore units via the MLB’s installed VHF-FM radios.  The CCS may be used aboard the 47 foot MLB in almost all Coast Guard operational missions, including, but not limited to the following Continuity of Operations, Ports Waterways Coastal Security  (PWCS), Search and Rescue (SAR), Law Enforcement (LE), M
