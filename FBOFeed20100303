NC3A intends to use the International Competitive Bidding (ICB) One Envelope Procedure, in which the price proposals are opened and evaluated and the bids ranked in order by lowest price. Technical Evaluation then commences with the lowest price bid until a fully compliant bid is found.<br /><br />The estimated value of this project is not available at this time. The reference for the IFB is IFB-CO-12546-POL-GAG. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the same reference.</p>
<p>The successful contractor may be required to handle and store classified information up to the level of NATO SECRET. In addition, contractor personnel working on NATO sites will be required to hold individual security clearances of NATO SECRET.

In the latter case, the bidder will be required to quote for the related option referring to the upgrade of Have Quick II radios to SATURN. This option will be part of the evaluation.</p>
<p>The bidders will also be required to quote for options referring to additional equipment to be installed in additional sites in Poland. The options will be part of the evaluation.</p>
<p>The solicitation will require the bidders to guarantee that the radio frequencies specified are compatible with the regulations and controls of the nations and that national frequency clearances will be obtained as appropriate.</p>
<p>The bidders will have to take in to account that the installation will be performed on existing sites, which have electromagnetic and infrastructure constraints.</p>

<ARCHDATE>08302010
<CONTACT>Dr. Mari Maeda, Fax (703) 248-1880, Email DARPA-BAA-10-41@darpa.mil
<DESC>The goal of the Transformative Apps program is to place the right mobile software applications ("apps") into the hands of warfighters as the apps are needed. As a result of this program, a diverse array of apps of national security relevance will be realized using an innovative new development and acquisition process. A military apps marketplace will be created to enable rapid innovation to meet user needs based on a direct collaboration between a vibrant and highly competitive development community and involved communities of end-users. The program will address all the challenges - technical, business, and operational - faced to make the new capabilities available for use in the field. The end objective is to transition the resulting systems to the end users in the Services, and to foster a new model for rapidly and effectively acquiring, introducing, maintaining, and enhancing software.
<p>DARPA seeks proposals for new and innovative technologies in the following Areas of Interest.</p>
<p>Apps Marketplace Architecture <br />A new architecture for apps marketplace and collaboration infrastructure is required. Of particular interest are: tools and processes (spanning the range from automated code validation tools to quality assurance management processes) to be used in vetting new apps, social networking platforms for promoting innovation and idea sharing between users and developers, schemes to incentivize user feedback and participation, and new business models for creating and maintaining apps.</p>
<p>Applications Development <br />DARPA is seeking applications to fill a diverse set of needs, including the tactical battlefield, humanitarian missions, disaster recovery, and other mission areas. Example functionalities include command and control, reporting, mission planning, intelligence/ surveillance/ reconnaissance, real-time collaboration, geospatial visualization, analysis, language translation, training, and logistics tracking. For the initial implementation, all apps should target the Android platforms. Special attention must be paid to the apps' user interfaces and usability functions, as well as striving towards general simplicity and ease-of-use. While some apps will function without network access (except for occasional synchronization or updates), other apps may require more consistent network connectivity. For apps that rely heavily on network connectivity, the emphasis must be placed on minimal bandwidth consumption and application robustness in spite of frequent network disconnection. In all cases, any server infrastructure requirements needed to support the apps should be included as part of the proposal.</p>
<p>Middleware Services and Libraries <br />Middleware services and libraries are required to facilitate shared capabilities and accelerate app development. Examples technologies include map viewing, time services, data synchronization, speech recognition, information assurance, peer-to-peer services, and apps management. Of particular importance are middleware and tools to enable secure, robust operation of apps on tactical networks in spite of limited backend computing/storage resources and dynamically changing connectivity. Data compression, synchronization, pre-fetch and caching will play a key role in many of the applications. Tools for monitoring, managing and analyzing individual apps and network traffic will also be developed as part of this program.</p>
<p>Network Infrastructure <br />An affordable, robust, and secure mobile tactical network capability compatible with commercial smartphones will be developed. Infrastructure kits that allow for light-weight mobile base stations need to be easily deployed in multiple variants (e.g. for a large fixed site location, an outpost, a vehicle on-the-move or at- the-halt) and will be used to reach mobile dismounted users. The program will leverage, to the greatest extent possible, commercial components and standards and focus on demonstrating "good enough" solutions with appropriate security and functionality enhancements for tactical users. Non-developmental commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware should be favored when available. The nodes must be sufficiently low-cost and affordable for wide deployment to the lowest tactical echelons and have a desired target network node cost of $5,000 per vehicle. Solutions that build on open cellular standards (3GPP) should be considered as well as open source implementations of those standards (e.g. OpenBTS). Proposals should describe the hardware and software design, trade-offs in cost/size/reach/power, and approaches in network discovery, control, provisioning and management, routing and inter-networking. Special attention must be given to the software modifications required to address key security vulnerabilities in commercial devices and wireless networks. If hardware modifications are recommended, a justification must be clearly articulated and the approach must be consistent with the program goal of affordable per-unit cost and rapid execution. The Transformative Apps program will primarily focus on the use of apps in unclassified environments and networks. Any efforts that specifically focus on enabling apps on classified networks should be described as part of options.</p>
<p>Other Considerations <br />DARPA is also interested in proposals outside the Areas of Interest described above, including vulnerability analysis, security architecture, and other topics related to apps development and deployment. The following are additional considerations for the proposers:</p>
<p>Proposed schedules should be very aggressive, with initial proof-of-concept demonstration targeted within the first 6 months, and iterative enhancements thereafter.</p>
<p>Proposers should submit separate proposals if they are interested in more than one Area of Interest.</p>
<p>Proposals with efforts involving development of multiple apps (or multiple services) should describe each of the apps (or services) in separate tasks that are individually costed out or, alternatively, write separate proposals.</p>
<p>An organization that is proposing to implement an apps store will be expected to maintain full fairness and impartiality, and hence are strongly discouraged from developing apps under this BAA.</p>

<DESC>Expressions of Interest Sought  Holt County, Nebraska


The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in ONeill, NE that will be expiring. The Government is seeking to lease approximately 5224 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space. The rentable space must yield a minimum of 4975 contiguous ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet (OASF). The lease term requirement is for 10 years. The space must be available for occupancy on or before 2/1/2011. The delineated area is bounded or affronted on the

North - 	873rd Rd
South - 	Cowboy Trail
East - 	494 Rd
West  	Hwy 281/Harrison St

Other applicable requirements include:

 28 paved surface parking spaces
 Specific Information Technology requirements

The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Governments requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.

<DESC>The United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) has a requirement for hazardous fuels reduction services to treat vegetation to reduce the risk of wildland fires in Eastern Washington.  It is anticipated that an indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ), multiple award task order contracts (MATOC) will be issued.  The government may award as many as 8 IDIQ contracts, but through evaluation may elect to only award as few as 2 IDIQ Contracts.  Project areas are reforestation areas, natural and managed stands of timber of all ages, size and species, shrub fields, or grass areas. Fuels will consist of harvest activity slash, natural fuels, live fuels and slashed shrubs and trees. Fuel loadings range from less than 1/2 ton per acre to as high as 100 tons or more per acre. Treatments such as brushing, chipping, piling, fuel break construction, and prescribed fire have been shown to reduce the risk of wildland fire and the severity of fires that do occur. The objective is to treat fuels present on units identified to reduce fuel loading and optimize the treatment of those fuels to the most effective burning period. The services are designed to provide for wildfire hazard reduction, prescribed burning and mop-up, and related services. This may require vegetation manipulation, burn unit preparation, prescribed fire modules and mop-up in compliance with its terms, specifications and provisions. This may include furnishing labor, supervision, transportation, operating supplies and incidentals to perform all work necessary to conduct slashing, girdling, lop and scatter, selective slashing, pruning, fuel modification zone construction, hand piling and cover, prescribed fire plan preparation, fire line construction and maintenance, fuels pullback, mop-up, snag felling, roadblock removal/restoration, requested holding and mop-up.
This requirement is 100% set aside for small businesses under NAICS 115310. The small business size standard is 7 million.  This solicitation will be available on or about March 18, 2010. Potential offerors may obtain a copy of the solicitation ONLY at http://ideasec.nbc.gov. No hard copies of the solicitation will be provided. Vendors must be registered at http://www.ccr.gov to be considered eligible for award.

The best value approach provides the opportunity to select an offeror who is not necessarily the lowest priced or the highest technically-ranked.  If awarded the contract, the Offeror shall provide and complete all necessary and required design and contraction documents, and complete construction in compliance with these requirements.

The estimated start date is 06/15/2010.

Description
The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Angiogenesis Core Facility (ACF), Radiation Oncology Branch (ROB) plans to procure on a sole source basis the Yeast Two Hybrid (Y2H) analysis from Myriad Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 320 Wakara Way, Salt Lake City, UT 84108.

This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1).  

Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation.  This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.

The National Cancer Institutes (NCI) Angiogensis Core Facility (ACF) part of the Radiation Oncology Branch (ROB) has previously shown that the aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor (AHRR) is a tumor suppressor gene in many human cancers. AHRR is a heterodimeric transcription factor and its action depends upon binding to several other factors (including ARNT and HIF). Therefore, finding the different binding partners of the  AHRR is essential to understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying its tumor suppressive potential. Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) is a molecular biology technique used to discover proteinprotein interactions and protein-DNA interactions by testing for physical interactions (such as binding) between two proteins or a single protein and a DNA molecule, respectively. The ACF/ROB requires the services of a contractor to perform an Y2H experiment to globally evaluate the protein-to-protein interaction potential of the four splice forms of the AHRR gene.  The contractor shall provide an analysis of the AHRR protein, or more specifically, 12 protein fragments using Y2H to determine protein-protein interactions.   

Myriad Pharmaceuticals, Inc. offers a unique combination of activation domain libraries, bioinformatics, industrial-scale throughput and protein-protein interaction database availability to enable a comprehensive custom yeast two-hybrid program for the discovery of novel protein-protein interactions in a minimal time frame.  Myriad Pharmaceuticals Inc., has developed a database encompassing those proteins which exhibit promiscuous binding behavior. These too, are eliminated by the ProNet quality control process. ProNet is a protein- protein interaction database containing >35,000 interactions for >5400 human & >1800 mouse proteins. Thus, when any given protein is searched by Myriad, it is highly probable that the interactions from the newly searched protein will connect to interaction networks already present in the database. This allows any newly searched protein to be assigned by association to particular biochemical & cellular processes. This feature is essential in this project and Myriad is the only source with the analysis capabilities made possible by its extensive database.

Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 6120 Executive Boulevard, EPS Suite 600, Room 6068, Rockville, MD 20852, UNITED STATES.

Description
The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), Office of Cancer Survivorship (OCS) plans to procure on a sole source basis with John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 111 River Street, Hoboken, NJ 07030 for supplemental publications services regarding a special supplement issue for the Journal, Cancer, based on articles generated from the 2008 Biennial Cancer Survivorship Research Conference. 

This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1).

Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation.  This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.

Period of Performance: Performance shall be for three (3) months from date of award.

The key mission of the DCCPS/OCS is to enhance the quality and length of survival of all persons diagnosed with cancer and to minimize or stabilize adverse effects experienced during cancer survivorship.  One of the ways the OCS fulfills this mission is by promoting the dissemination of information to researchers examining survivors outcomes, professionals who treat cancer patients and the public, concerning the problems and needs of cancer survivors and their families and interventions to address these. To permit even broader dissemination of information, the OCS published papers from the 2002 and 2006 conferences in the main journal of the American Cancer Society (ACS), Cancer.  The current requirement seeks to use this same journal outlet for publication of the 2008 conference papers.

The contractor shall provide all publishing services associated with publishing the content, including typesetting, editing, coordinate peer review and any necessary corrections and revisions to the supplement.  The contractor shall provide copies of peer review forms for all manuscripts, edited page proofs and copies of the final published Supplement issue.

John Wiley & Sons, Inc. is the sole publisher for the journal Cancer. Cancer was selected as the dissemination vehicle of choice for three main reasons: First, because it is the main journal of the American Cancer Society, a partner in the support and conduct of the biennial cancer survivorship conferences. Second, Cancer was considered an ideal outlet for sharing the survivorship science as it is widely read by members of the national as well as international scientific and clinical communities, specifically those interested and involved in the treatment and care of cancer survivors and their family members.  Third, Cancer has a supplement series, permitting publication of large sets of papers on identified topics, something that few cancer journals are willing to accommodate. Finally, according to the NIH Library it has an impact factor of 5.238 (2008 rating) placing it above many other cancer-focused journals that accept sets of papers.  The aforementioned makes them uniquely qualified to fulfill the governments requirement.

<p>The NINDS Division of Intramural Research (DIR)-Viral Immunology Section (VIS) works to identify biomarkers by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) haplotype determination and link these with clinical and MRI phenotypes in a large cohort of relapsing-remitting (RR-) MS patients and to identify biomarkers that separate MS patients and healthy, matched controls. Up to 1,000 patients have been enrolled in and treated under a multi-center trial of combination therapy (MS-CombiRx) using two approved disease-modifying therapies (interferon-beta, IFN-b, Avonex&reg;; glatiramer-acetate, GA) as single treatments or in combination. In addition, 200 healthy, matched control individuals are also being recruited. The results of the biomarker studies will be assessed in relationship to both the clinical and MRI phenotype at baseline and to change in disability, relapse rate, response to therapy and change in MRI measures of disease during the 3-year treatment period. Each of the biomarker study components will be analyzed with respect to biomarkers that discriminate between MS patients and controls. Similar to rheumatoid arthritis or autoimmune diabetes, multiple sclerosis (MS) is considered a complex disease with autoimmune pathogenesis as well as vulnerability of the target tissue, i.e. the central nervous system (CNS). The results of the biomarker study should provide a better understanding of the disease pathogenesis, of the inter-individual disease heterogeneity, and finally identify biomarkers such as gene signatures and individual genes that are correlated with responsiveness or non-responsiveness to single drug treatment or the combination of the two drugs.</p>
<p>Initial studies examining the value of genome wide analysis in multiple sclerosis using samples obtained from the BiomarkerMS project was approached as a collaboration between investigators in Barcelona and the BiomarkerMS project as well as investigators at TGen. Several hundred NIH samples were provided for this analysis. The approaches involved a pooled genome wide scan of 500,000 SNPs. The results were published in PLoS One 2008;3(10):e3490. The results indicated that in addition to SNP rs3129934 on chromosome 6 in the MHC region the next strongest association was found for a SNP on chromosome 13. The region identified on chromosome 13 has not been previously identified. The findings support the approach used in this preliminary collaboration.</p>
<p>Because of the success of this preliminary work, it is determined that the analysis of the entire BiomarkerMS data set to be continued with investigators at TGen. It is important that the future results be as consistent as possible with the preliminary results obtained to date.</p>
<p>TGen is the world leader in analyzing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to identify disease-causing genes, associations, and DNA signatures, all of which have profound implications for detection, prognosis and therapeutic intervention. The TGen SNP Genotyping Center offers innovative solutions that address the requirements for flexibility, simplicity, throughput, economy, and accuracy. TGen has successfully completed a pilot project of 100 samples obtained from the MS-CombiRx study. SNP analysis was performed on an Illumina Infinium Human Omni1 platform. This pilot program was done in a timely and efficient manner and it is clearly that TGen can provide the necessary bioinformatic support for the on-going study. Based on this preliminary and encouraging findings of this pilot program as well as the expertise and world class reputation that TGen has in this field of investigation, it is imperative that TGen complete the analysis of the remaining samples in the MS-CombiRx study. Moreover, the clinical samples are limited and irreplaceable, it is crucial to have TGen continue performing and complete the analysis. To award a contract to a new and different vendor to perform this ongoing analysis will further delay the ongoing project and in turn costs the Government more to have the study&nbsp;completed.</p>
<p>Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Bethesda, MD. Period of performance will last a minimum of one (1) year and will expire two (2) years from the effective date of the project.<br /><br />No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses submitted to ln18x@nih.gov on or before 1:00 PM ET March 12, 2010. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the government to determine if it can meet the above specifications described herein.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Please reference the announcement number NOI-1449245 on all correspondence.</p>

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract and is not a request for competitive proposals. The government intends to solicit a proposal and enter into a contract with Coastal Resources Associates, Inc, 302A PIER VIEW WAY, OCEANSIDE, CA 92054-2525 a small business concern, to further the implementation of the Near Shore Monitoring program for Southwest Alaska Network Parks. Coastal Resources has worked on this specific project for over 4 years and has created a standardization of data under a prior effort. Please see the below Justification for other than Full and Open Competition for further details.
This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, the Government shall consider all responses received prior to the close date of this announcement. Written responses to this notice shall contain sufficient documentation to establish bonafide capability to fulfill the requirement. A solicitation is not available. Please-mail contract specialist, Jordan Gunn with responses or questions regarding this requirement at jordan_gunn@nps.gov.


JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION (or SOLE SOURCE)
Background: For the past 20 + years Coastal Resource Associates  (CRA) has been engaged in research and monitoring in the nearshore Gulf of Alaska. Since 2001 CRA has designed the monitoring for the Nearshore Gulf Ecosystem Monitoring Project (Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council).  Beginning in 2004 CRA has been involved with implementing vital signs monitoring in the Southwest Alaska Network parks (SWAN).  CRA has also researched inter-annual variation in clam growth and possible links between climate change and production in nearshore systems; evaluated the abundance and growth of green sea urchins, Strongylocentrotus drobachiensis, in relation to recovering sea otter populations; and assessed potential injury and recovery of nearshore vertebrate predators in Prince William Sound, Alaska.  This experience and work in the marine nearshore of the Gulf of Alaska makes CRA uniquely qualified to continue SWAN's ongoing monitoring effort.  I know of no other company that could bring this type of experience and knowledge to the present project.
1. FAR Statutory Authority cited: 6.302, Circumstances Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition.  
Per FAR 6.302-1(ii)(A) Coastal Resources Associates, Inc is the only responsible vendor able to carry out these services due to the substantial duplications of cost to the Government that would not be expected to be recovered through competition.
2.  Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs.
The mission of this contract is to continue implementation of a marine nearshore long-term monitoring program along the coastlines of 4 national parks in SWAN.  This long-term monitoring is needed to support understanding and protecting the biophysical coastal resources of these park units as directed by enabling legislation, the NPS-Natural Resources Challenge, and the NPS-Ocean Park Strategy.  
3.  A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights etc.).
CRA utilizes a unique and innovative concept, and has demonstrated a unique capability to provide the particular research services required. CRA has been involved with designing monitoring for the SWAN since 2004. It is crucial to continue implementation using the same scientists to avoid the bias inherent in having different contractors using different field personnel and applying different approaches to conduct monitoring.  Continuity is the foundation of long-term ecological monitoring because of the need to collect standardized measurements and produce continuous data bases. Any program of long-term research and monitoring, therefore, must involve both individual and institutional participation in some collaborative manner.
4.  A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted:  Few nearshore marine ecologists have designed and implemented nearshore monitoring along the northern Gulf of Alaska including National Park coastlines and are qualified to meet the requirements of this contract. Annually, at the Marine Science Symposium (the primary meeting of marine coastal scientists for the north pacific) in Anchorage, the NPS solicited marine scientists that were interested and qualified to work with SWAN. Since 2002, this effort has resulted in contracts with several private and non-profit businesses and organizations that have also had a long association with the EVOS-Gulf Ecosystem Monitoring program. The only firm uniquely qualified to do the intertidal monitoring development in conjunction with the development of the overall nearshore monitoring protocol has been CRA.  
5.  Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:  
Since 1989, CRA has applied new science and technologies to achieving interdisciplinary, synthesis directed toward understanding long-term changes in marine ecosystems in the northern Gulf of Alaska. Other firms would not have the historical memory or experience that CRA incorporates.
6.  A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to issue an order under an existing Basic Ordering Agreement (N00019-05-G-0008) to Raytheon to perform a trade study to determine requirements needed to develop a scaled-back or modified capability version of the Inc 1A ship system for interim support of Navy carrier air wing aircraft and pilot certification ashore various Naval Air Stations. Additionally, the study will assess requirements of the DDG 1000 1A ship system for any peculiar impacts, e.g. waveform, bandwidth. NAVAIRs intent of this trade study is to identify a single technical solution to both requirements and, determine requirements needed to allow transmission of the Inc 1A two-way data link within CONUS in conjunction with the Inc 1A ship systems ashore identified above that would not interfere with civil aviation FCC requirements. This requirement will be procured in accordance with the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition under 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a)(2), in that Raytheon is the sole responsibly source, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy the requirement.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to solicit on a sole source basis, DRS Sonar Systems, 400 Professional Drive, Gaithersburg, Maryland, 20879 to provide non-personal technical support services for recommended performance upgrades to the AN/SQQ-32 Classification Sonar and Ship Borne Classification Sonar Processing Equipment.  This procurement is sole source for the following reasons.  Thales Company was the 1980's designer, developer, manufacturer, and current vendor for the AN/SQQ-32 (V)3 Classify Sonar Sub-system and its associated parts and components.  Sonar Systems (a DRS / Thales Company joint US venture), is the only company that can support the US Navy's AN/SQQ-32 (V)3 mine hunting sonar system pre-planned re-design to provide system analysis and upgraded design information based on obsolescence and reliability issues currently plaguing this now outdated design.  Through Sonar Systems affiliation with Thales, they are the only US company to have developed and put into production, the current US Navy's AN/SQQ-32 (V)3 Classification mine-hunting sonar.  Additionally, synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) capability for similar sonar systems has been designed and developed by Thales, which could be adapted for 32 applications with minimal effort and cost savings to the Government.   Their corporate experience would significantly mitigate schedule and technical risk associated with the sonar's functional capabilities, parts obsolescence, system reliability issues, and common architecture with the MCM combat suite.  Given the complexity of the AN/SQQ032(V)3 system and the level of system knowledge required to evaluate the High Frequency Wide Band (HFWB) and Classification sonar common operator console designs to accommodate upgrades to the system and to incorporate new technology requirements,  Sonar Systems is the only source possessing the e! xpertise, internal technical data, equipment, and experienced personnel necessary to successfully provide the engineering and design services to accomplish all tasking.  Sonar System's corporate experience would significantly mitigate schedule and technical risk associated with the sonar's functional capabilities, parts obsolescence, system reliability issues, and common architecture with the mine countermeasures combat suite. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency; contact Jeff Frohlich 850-235-5907.  NAICS:334511, Size Standard:750 employees, FSC:AC34 applies.

<CONTACT>Emily Graham, Phone (202) 254-5611, Email emily.graham@dhs.gov
<DESC><br />The Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate Transportation Security Laboratory (DHS S&amp;T TSL), located at the William J. Hughes Technical Center, Atlantic City International Airport, New Jersey will support the development of Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) Algorithms for Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT) systems located at airport security checkpoints.
<p>TSL proposes to sponsor a spiral-based research and development effort that will improve upon commercially-available AIT systems to meet TSA requirements, using a system of ATR algorithms as an enabler. By exploiting the specific image features of known threats (i.e., guns, knives, improvised explosive devices, homemade explosives), ATR will aid security and efficiency at our nation's airport checkpoints.</p>
<p>Additionally, TSL proposes to implement an Open Architecture design to the ATR system being implemented so that the AIT systems can be integrated into the framework established at a checkpoint. The goal is to implement the ATR as part of TSL's Integrated Checkpoint (ICP) program, giving the AIT the capability for modularity, to accommodate any equipment configuration required for a given airport. Additionally, the framework will accommodate growth of the algorithms for the detection of a wider range of threats as the ATR capability is developed.</p>
<p>It is estimated that there will be two phases for the aforementioned project. Phase I will include a Government evaluation of technical reports, proposals, system design documentation, Preliminary Design Review (PDR), Critical Design Review (CDR), test plans and other documentation. It is estimated that Phase I will have a 12 month period of performance</p>
<p>Phase II will include further development of selected algorithms as well as an application window in which vendors that had previously submitted algorithms can propose algorithms for evaluation and will conclude with the assessment of ATR systems. It is estimated that Phase II will have a 12 month period of performance</p>
<p>The Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) Algorithms for Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT) systems Broad Area Announcement (BAA) / Solicitation document will be available at www.fedbizopps.gov. and https://baa.st.dhs.gov/ on or about&nbsp;18 March 2010.</p>

<DESC>The 354th Contracting Squadron will be soliciting a 100%, competitive Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) to provide indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity and design-build construction efforts to support the 354th CES mission at Eielson AFB, Alaska. The contract will be comprised of three base contracts to be awarded competively. Individual task(s) order(s) work will consist of multiple disciplines in general construction categories and execute a broad range of maintenance, repair, minor and/or new construction. Task order limits will be a minimum of $2,000 per call and a maximum of $5,000,000.00 per call. The contractor shall provide all material, equipment, labor and general conditions to accomplish design, maintenance, repair, and minor construction projects in an expeditious manner. The maximum for each of the contracts is $10 million per year. The total maximum value of the contract for all three contractors for all three years is $90 million. Each contract awarded will contain a basic 12-month period and two 12-month option periods. There is a guaranteed minimum of $100k for each awardee.<br />Work to be performed under the MACC will be within the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes as follows: Sector 23 - Construction; Subsection 236 - Construction of Buildings with a size standard $33.5 Million; Subsector 237 - Heavy Construction with a size standard $13 Million (except dredging and surface cleanup activities) and Subsector 238 - Specialty Trade Contractors - Size standard $14 Million. The work may include facility upgrades, utility work, airfield pavement, roads, roofs and other assorted repair and maintenance projects. The construction work includes tasks in various trades such as carpentry, asbestos/lead-based paint abatement and removal, demolition, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, concrete, masonry, steel, painting, roofing and paving, locations of work will be at Eielson AFB, AK and may include Clear AS, Air Force Recreational site at Birch Lake, or in any of the various exercise and bomb ranges in interior Alaska (the PACIFIC Alaska Range Complex, or PARC). Offers are solicited only from business concerns who are current in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR), and North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code under 236220 must specifically be included in the Offerors approved business plan.
<p><br />A Request for Proposal (RFP) is contemplated utilizing best value source selection procedures described in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.3, Air Force Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFFARS) 5315.3, and AFFARS Mandatory Procedures 5315.3, targeted toward competitive offerors with a 30-day response time (offers due 30 days after issuing). In using this approach, the Government seeks to award up to three (3) contracts (three Hub Zone certified business concerns), who give the Air Force the greatest confidence that they can meet our requirements for up to 100% design and construction expertise on infrastructure renovation, repair, new construction, roads, and/or airfield work. The solicitation will include a design/build seed project that will be used to evaluate these capabilities. The magnitude of the seed project is between $500,000 and $1,000,000.<br />The seed projects general description is as follows:</p>
<p>The intent of project is to completely renovate the Army Lift Station, Building 2212, during which time the awardee shall provide interim grinding and pumping of sewerage to the Eielson Waste Water Treatment Plant. The Air Force requires a complete and functional design and renovation of this lift station, appropriate for the sub-arctic environment of interior Alaska and that meet all applicable current requirements of all applicable codes. The lift station was originally constructed in 1953 with new equipment installed in 1991. The Army lift station has become outdated and has reached the conclusion of its expected normal duty life. Maintenance issues are becoming more frequent and failure of existing equipment is unacceptable.</p>
<p>The offeror's proposal must convey to the Government that the offeror is capable, possess sufficient technical expertise and experience, possess sufficient resources, and is able to plan, organize, and use those resources in a coordinated and timely fashion such that the technical requirements shall be achieved and costs shall be controlled. Up to three (3) highest rated offerors from the source selection will receive basic contract award. Evaluation factors will be defined in the RFP. The highest rated offeror will be awarded the seed project. All future task orders will be competed among contract awardees.</p>
<p><br />The solicitation will be available in electronic format only. The RFP will be posted on the website at http://www.fbo.gov/ on or about 17 Mar 2009 and close on or about 30 calendar days thereafter. No hard copies will be provided. It is the contractor's responsibility to check the website for any and all amendments to this solicitation. Prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before award of a government contract; failure to register in the CCR database may cause your firm to be ineligible for award.</p>
<p><br />A site visit will be conducted at Eielson AFB, on or around 24 March 2010 (exact date, time and location will be provided in the RFP), for the purpose of explaining the concepts involved with the project and answering questions regarding the project and solicitation.</p>
<p><br />Any questions must be submitted in writing, please send them by e-mail to both SrA Mark A. Chranowski, mark.chranowski@eielson.af.mil (907-377-0108) and Mr. Jonathan Dittmer, johnathan.dittmer@eielson.af.mil. (907-377-5444). QUESTIONS WILL NOT BE TAKEN BY PHONE CALL.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Service (DHHS), Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration (SAMHSA), Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (CSAT) through the Program Support Center, plan to award a sole source simplified, fixed price acquisition to The McShin Foundation, 2300 Dumbarton Road, Richmond, VA  23228.   The Recovery Month MLB events will recognize the need to support alcohol and drug addiction treatment and educate people that addiction knows no boundaries in race, gender, culture and social and economic status.  Baseball has been coined as Americas National pastime and millions of Americans tune into and attend Major League Baseball games.  MLB players and coaches become household names and children and adults admire them as heroes and leaders.  Because of the admiration baseball players and coaches receive from people, they add value to events, initiatives and activities held by civic leaders and the community, and therefore, encourage greater participation and involvement.  The aim for the 2010 observance is to grow the attendance record of each event and to engage major figures of MLB and recognized public elected officials and their spouses in order to draw increased media attention to these events.   Task 1: Contractor shall make initial contact with MLB organizations to gain participation of ten (10) MLB organizations and local event coordinating organizations.  Task 2: The Contractor must input all the games and event information in the official Recovery Month web site at www.recoverymonth.gov as soon as the game date is decided.  Task 3:  Contractor shall assist the MLB and local coordinating organizations in the development of the:  1) Invitation letter, distribution list and mailings (SAMHSA/CSAT and Recovery Month must be identified on all materials generated.) 2) Event advertising and marketing pieces (SAMHSA/CSAT and Recovery Month must be identified on all materials generated.)  3) Media advisories, news releases and media list (SAMHSA/CSAT and Recovery Month must be identified on all materials generated.) 4) Public education materials such as flyers, posters, etc., for use before and during the event (SAMHSA/CSAT and Recovery Month theme and logo must be identified on all materials generated.  Funding credit must also be included such as this event was partially funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.  5) Include a minimum of two mailings complemented by numerous promotional and follow-up telephone calls. Task 4:  Develop letters in order to invite Congressional delegates, to include U.S. Senators and Members of Congress, as well as local key dignitaries and civic and elected officials such as mayors, and city council members.  Copies of the letters must be submitted to SAMHSA for approval prior to mailing.   Task 5:   Obtain five (5) personal vignettes from the MLB team members, coaching or managing staff, or family member. The vignette should include, if possible, the effects that treatment has had on reclaiming their lives.  Task 6:   Contractor shall acquire and generate photos, video footage and materials, to include signed hold harmless forms, submitted to the agency no later than 7 days after each event, so materials can be used in highlighting the accomplishments of the Recovery Month activity.  Footage and all the signed hold harmless forms will be provided to SAMHSA within 7 days of the event for use in the television, radio and web-based Road to Recovery series production highlighting the accomplishments of the 2010 Recovery Month celebration.  Task 7:  Contractor shall travel to the ten (10) MLB initiatives to assist in the event execution process.  Task 8:  Contractor shall work with SAMHSA/CSAT outreach minority contractors and emphasize incorporating minority organizations and/or individuals in the community forum events.  Inclusion of specific minorities/organizations in those communities ensures that issues relevant to these communities are addressed.  Task 9:  Contractor shall be responsible for generating a final quantitative and qualitative report by October 29, 2010, that will include the participating MLB organizations, event location, final attendance numbers, photos and audio/video tapes, any hold harmless forms so materials can be used for other government events as deemed appropriate, generated media coverage report, including print and broadcast, and copies of all print media articles generated by the Recovery Month events and activities.  The proposed Simplified Acquisition is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source.  Interested persons may identify their interest by responding to the requirement within 10 days after the date of publication of this notice.  A determination by the government not to complete this proposed simplified acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No solicitation is available.  For further information, please contact Julia Savoy in Room 5C-03, Parklawn Building, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Maryland 20857 or on 301-443-1386.

This requirement is follow-on to Contract No. W81XWH-05-D-0001 with Battelle Memorial Institute.  Upon award of the new contract, the resultant contractor must be able to conduct multiple tasks simultaneously and adjust to rapidly changing priorities.  The Government plans to award a three-year indefinite-delivery (cost reimbursement plus fixed fee) contract with a provision for two one-year options.

<a href="mailto:naomi.melendez@usmc.mil">contract specialist</a>
<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC) intends to negotiate and award a sole-source contract to Syracuse Research Corporation Technical (SRC-Tec), 5801 East Taft Road, North Syracuse, NY 13212,for life cycle management support for the AN/TPQ-48(V)2 and AN/TPQ-48(V)2 upgraded Radar Systems. The justification permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C 2304(C)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The AN/TPQ-48(V)2 Radar system is a lightweight, transportable, short-range, solid state, 360 degree S-Band radar. The radar is integrated within the Family of Target Acquisition Systems (FTAS). The radar may be configured for stand alone operation in support of ground combat to provide counter fire data, cues, and situational awareness ground counter-fire weapons via tactical wireless radio to the Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS). It is one of two tactical ground radar systems capable of detecting, tracking, and providing cueing information and target data on short to medium range indirect fire weapons. This system has proven to be invaluable in its contribution to the ground fight in both the Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) and joint theater battlefield. Current support for the AN/TPQ-48(V)2 is contracted with SRC-Tec through US Army contract vehicles. As the US Army and United States Marine Corps (USMC) combat operations and deployment tempo and missions change, it has been increasingly difficult to maintain a joint support strategy. Additionally, the US Army has declared that support focus will begin to shift to the Lightweight Counter Mortar Radar (LCMR) (V)3. This hardware is beyond the USMC requirements and is not planned for procurement and support at this time. MCSC anticipates the award of a single Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract for a base and four option years. Support will include the following:  1) Engineering studies to support system improvements, eliminate obsolescence, and capitalize on technology insertion; 2) Development of Engineering Change Proposals (ECPs) in concert with the previous studies for implementation in the system baseline; 3) Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) in the form of a Vendor Level Maintenance Program (VLM); 4) CLS in the form of Field Service Representatives (FSRs) for the AN/TPQ-48(V)2 at the fielded sites; 5) Procurement and incorporation of ECPs in the AN/TPQ-48(V)2 baseline; 6) CLS in the form of provisioning data products subsequent to ECP procurement, including parts lists, identification data, engineering drawings, change pages to drawings, change pages to Technical Manuals (TMs) and updates to Interactive Electronic TMs (IETMs); and 7) A Program Management (PM) structure to encompass single interface for the management of all program elements. SRC-Tec is considered the only source capable of meeting these requirements. No Request for Proposal (RFP) is available for competitive bidding; however, interested parties are encouraged to submit a statement of capability for satisfying requirements by email.  Information received will be used only to consider whether to conduct a competitive procurement, and must be received in this office within 30 days of this notice.  A determination by the Government not to compete this effort, based on responses received, is solely within the discretion of the Government. See Note 22.

In order to protect the procurement integrity of any future procurement, if any, that may arise from this announcement, information regarding the technical point of contact will not be given and no appointments for presentations will be made.

The 902d Contracting Squadron (902 CONS), Randolph AFB, TX has a requirement for a firm fixed-price, Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) Contract for paving.  Work shall consist of furnishing all labor, supplies, materials, supervision, transportation, equipment, and all else required to support the 902 Civil Engineering Squadron (902 CES) paving requirements. The acquisition is for a broad range of repair, maintenance, and/or construction of Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) or Portland Cement Concrete (PCC) for roads, parking lots, runways, taxiways and shoulders (including all associated site work and appurtenances such as curbs, gutters and sidewalk), at Randolph AFB, Seguin Auxiliary Field, Canyon Lake Recreational Area.  During the contract period, the 902 CES will identify requirements for each specific job, and 902 CONS will issue individual task orders to the contractor to complete those jobs. The contractor will be required to furnish all labor, supplies, materials, supervision, transportation, equipment, and all else necessary to manage and successfully accomplish each project.

The NAICS code for this solicitation is for 237310, Highway, Street, and Bridge Construction. The Small Business Size Standard is $33,500,000.  The total project magnitude for the life of the contract is expected to be between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000. The contract period is expected to be 36 months with a potential maximum ceiling of not more than $10,000,000.   The minimum guaranteed amount of work to be ordered under the life of the contract is $25,000.  Once the minimum guaranteed has been met, the Government reserves the right to not order any more work against the contract.  The contract will consist of issuing individual delivery orders valued between $25,000 and $1,000,000.  Although not a predictor of future requirements, historically, the magnitude of the individual delivery orders issued has varied between $100K and $200K with most of the delivery orders issued during the months of August and September.  Also historically, approximately 22 delivery orders were issued per year (approximately 18 with concurrent performance periods) with an approximate total magnitude of $2,000,000.  Furthermore, the average performance period of each delivery order was between 90 and 120 calendar days.  Approximately 65 percent of the work is expected to be airfield paving related with approximately 95 percent on Randolph AFB.

For pricing each delivery order, as of the time of this notice and subject to change, the Government shall use the most current RSMeans (Heavy Construction Data) Book as the Unit Price Guide, utilizing the bare costs (with the respective San Antonio, TX City Cost Index) of the respective line items (and quantities) times the contractors single coefficient awarded on the contract.

7) For the projects above should have a contract value of at least $3.5 Million. Identify the dollar value and explain in no more than one paragraph why we should consider it if less than $3.5 Million.
8) For the projects above should have experience working Airfield taxiways and runways.

Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. However, the Contracting Officer will utilize the information for technical and acquisition planning. All proprietary information not to be disseminated in Government documents must be clearly identified. Since this is a sources sought announcement only, no evaluation letters and/or results will be issued to the participants. This market survey is issued to determine whether or not this project should be set aside for HUBZone, competitive 8(a) in SBA Office Code 0681, or small business based on sufficient responses from respective business indicating an interest in proposing on this work if it is set-aside.

<DESC>BBU-35 Product Improvement Statement of Objectives<br />Purpose and Background:<br />The AF is currently experiencing several performance issues in using the BBU-35 Impulse Cartridge (IC). The purpose of this Statement of Objectives (SOO) is to develop a Product Improvement Plan (PIP) to address and correct these issues in a new design. The first issue is a failure to poll when loaded with chaff or flares in a dispenser. The aircraft sends a small current to the IC to detect whether it is present and servicable or not. Failure to poll results in false counts and decreased opportunities to eject countermeasures. Another problem is corrosion both on the exterior of the cart and at the bridge wire. Either type of corrosion can render the IC unusable. A third element to be corrected is excessive and inconsistent output. Excessive output results in higher set back forces as well as high exit velocities for the countermeasures. High velocity flares can leave the field of view of the threat too quickly, thus reducing their effectiveness. The final potential improvement is that the current IC has low success in igniting certain flares, specifically boron based flares like the M212.<br />Objectives:<br />The end objective is to develop a redesigned BBU-35 that is a form, fit, and function replacement for the current IC. The new design needs to have the same physical dimensions, same performance characteristics, and same all fire and no fire limits. Latitude for the new design includes propellant types and amounts, case materials, sealing method and/or closure type, and internal dimensions. <br />The BBU-35 is used on several different types of inert chaff, pyrotechnic flares, and pyrophoric IR decoys. Developing an improved IC will require evaluating the requirements of each application. See table 1 in appendix A for items and pertinent characteristics. In addition to force, pressure, and velocity characteristics, the ability to ignite pyrotechnic flares is critical.<br />The improved impulse cartridge must be able to pass the first article test and lot acceptance test as described in SP7729436. If any new propellant or explosive types are used, the cart will also have to pass safety of flight testing and hazard class testing.<br />DATA:<br />To qualify a new BBU-35 design, the AF will require test reports for performance testing, functional testing, safety of flight testing and hazard class testing. The AF also requires that the TDP for the improved IC be transferred to AF ownership at the conclusion of the PIP effort. <br /><br />Interested parties shall provide a rough estimate of expected costs of this redesign project.

1.  GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CONTRACTOR

BACKGROUND:     This position is located in the Department of State, Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, Office of Aviation, Santa Cruz, Bolivia.

The Office is divided into the Headquarters Group, the Operations Division, the Logistics Division, and Contracting Officers Representative, all of whom provide support and oversight of the contractor and host nation aviation operations.  The Director of the Office of Aviation manages the Department of State International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Aviation program through approximately 10 subordinate supervisors (in five countries), in addition to formal policies, procedures, and reporting requirements.  The Office of Aviation is responsible for the curtailment of the supply of illegal drugs from foreign sources into the United States through aerial and ground eradication of drug crops, interdiction of refining laboratories and trafficking activities, and other enforcement operations as directed by the Secretary.

Develop, coordinate, organize, and implement comprehensive operational systems and procedures for the Office of Aviation/RDTF.  These systems and procedures include, but are not limited to the Department of State Aircrew Training Program, Department of State Aviation Operations Directives, Department of State Guide to Aviation Training and Standardization, Department of State Aircrew Training Manuals, Office of Aviation Standard Operating Procedures for counter-narcotics operations in Bolivia, and Deployment Operations procedures in support of the RDTF operations throughout Bolivia.

<SUBJECT>Skin Staples and Staple Removers - Southwest and Northwest Regions
<SOLNBR>APP9-10-11-1002-01
<RESPDATE>032410
<CONTACT>Cynthia Ingrao, Phone 619-532-8517, Email cynthia.ingrao@med.navy.mil
<DESC>A.	General Information  

The Southwest and Northwest Regions will initiate the standardization process for Skin Staplers and Staple Removers for the Army, Navy, and Air Force medical facilities in California, Washington and Alaska.  In the Southwest Region this is a re-evaluation for 2 separate expired RIAs with Covidien for the Skin Staplers and with 3M for the Staple Removers.  This is also a re-evaluation for the Northwest Region who also has an expired RIA with Covidien for the Skin Staplers and Staple Removers. A multiple selection is only a possibility if no single vendor can meet the total requirements of the Regions and would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  In order to meet the total requirements of the Regions a vendor must be able to offer a comprehensive product line (all items within a product category) available in the necessary quantities to meet all of the DoD MTFs needs. That is, the required products must be available in the required quantities. As stated previously, it is not the preference of this standardization to make a multiple selection, however, if necessary due to non-availability from a single source, a multiple selection would be made based on a combination of Regional Clinical preference as determined by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) and vendor product availability. The product category includes Skin Staplers and Staple Removers in various sizes for the approximation of the skin. The entire category of Skin Staplers and Staple Removers has an annual demand of over $78,000.

The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the Southwest and Northwest Regions based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price. It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.

The secondary objective of this standardization initiative is the potential of decreasing the existing Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and thus dollars held as inventory.  The below item detail of the products being purchased within the Southwest and Northwest Regions will be used to target and cross-match product lists submitted by the vendor. This process will ensure the minimum requirements of the Region are met and help identify possible candidates for elimination (i.e. like product items), as well as potentially minimizing the number of SKUs included in a subsequent incentive agreement.

The major facilities in the area include but are not limited to Naval Medical Center San Diego; David Grant Medical Center, Travis AFB; Naval Hospital Camp Pendleton; Robert E. Bush Hospital, Twenty-Nine Palms; Weed Army Community Hospital, Ft. Irwin; Naval Hospital Lemoore; 9th Medical Group, Beale AFB; 30th Medical Group, Vandenberg AFB; 61st Medical Squadron, Los Angeles AFB; 95th Medical Group, Edwards AFB.

The major facilities in the Northwest Regions include but are not limited to Bassett Army Community Hospital, Fort Wainwright, AK; Bremerton Naval Hospital, Bremerton, WA; Fairchild AFB Clinic, Fairchild AFB, WA; 354th Medical Group, Eielson Air Force Base, AK; 3rd Medical Group, Elmendorf AFB, AK; Madigan Army Medical Center, Tacoma, WA; Oak Harbor Naval Hospital, Oak Harbor, WA.

This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor of the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program and obtaining a DAPA please access our web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.

The Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage/forecasted requirements.  The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods.  Anticipated award date is July 2010.  The evaluation will be based on technical, clinical and pricing factors.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price. The selection will be determined utilizing best value/trade off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.

B.	Products & Performance Required
 
The Southwest and Northwest Regions is seeking product line items in the category of Skin Staplers and Staple Removers.  The product category includes Skin Staplers and Staple Removers in various sizes for the approximation of the skin.  Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $78,000. This is a re-evaluation of this product group.  A multiple selection is only a possibility if no single vendor can meet the total requirements of the Region and would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  

At the request of the Southwest and Northwest Regions Military Treatment Facilities vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products offered by the vendor.

C. Instructions to Vendors

If you are interested in participating in this standardization initiative, email your (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, E-mail address), your answers to the technical questions/criteria below and product literature to cynthia.ingrao@med.navy.mil no later than March 24, 2010.  Submissions must be received by COB, 5:00 PM PST on the specified closing date/time of this sources sought notice.  Vendors that fail to meet the submittal deadline will be disqualified.

Vendors will be required to provide detailed responses to the technical/company criteria and product literature. Amplifying information about your products may be requested by the Government.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB to determine acceptability. All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. The vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process via e-mail communication with each vendor.  All communications of significant milestones, such as invitations to participate, notices of disqualification, etc. must be digitally signed.

The TPRB will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the criteria and determine acceptability.  Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria: Generally, responses to all questions in this section demonstrate:  (1) the vendor is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; (2) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (3) the vendor has, or is obtaining a DAPA for the items (vendors that fail to have a DAPA will be disqualified); (4) the vendor has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items, with Cardinal, the Prime Vendor for the region (vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified); (5) the vendor intends to provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and (6) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.

Technical/Company Criteria
1.	Vendors must provide a line of Skin Staplers and Staple Removers that are FDA approved and latex free.  A line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. Skin Staplers and Staple Removers required by the region are latex-free.  Please state that you can provide the product line and provide a complete list of items supplied including sizes, lengths and specifications for use (catalog, etc.).  In addition, send any applicable product literature in response to this RFQ.
2.	Vendors must have a DAPA, or be in the process of applying for a DAPA, for the Skin Staplers and Staple Removers Product Line. 
3.	Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal.  (Note that vendors that fail to have a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified.)
4.	Vendors must have a separate agreement with the Regions Prime Vendor, Cardinal Health.  Please provide documentation of your companys agreement with Prime Vendor.  (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the Regional PV will be disqualified.)
5.	Vendors must offer volume discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative.  Where FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as their DAPA price. Therefore, FSS prices do not represent a discount off the DAPA. Vendors that fail to offer a discount off the DAPA price will be disqualified.
6.	Vendors must provide the brand(s) that their company manufactures or distributes.
7.	Vendors must state under what standards their products are manufactured.
8.	Vendors must state if there is an expiration date on the packaging.
9.	Vendors must state under what regulatory and/or advisory agency their products are classified and whether their products are approved by these agencies.
10.	Vendors must state if their products are recyclable and/or environmentally friendly to discard in landfills.
11.	Vendors must provide educational tools or materials for this product line.  Vendors must list the tools and training available to staff and patients in response to this solicitation.
12.	Vendors must have a local representative in the Southwest and Northwest Regions that can provide assistance at regional facility locations.  Vendors must provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address.
13.	Vendors must provide all history of back orders and/or recalls that occurred during the most recent 12-month period for items in their Skin Staplers and Staple Removers product line, including dates, duration, cause, and resolution.  
a.	Vendors will not have an opportunity to provide additional information on back orders and recalls during any subsequent stage in this evaluation.  
b.	Vendors are encouraged to submit all information deemed relevant (i.e., positive resolutions, etc.) in response to this RFQ.
c.	Vendors should not provide point of contact information in response to this question.  Additionally, the Government will not contact any points of contact that are provided in response to this question.

Phase II - Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process.  The TPRB will request samples and product literature from the product group to be clinically evaluated at selected Military Treatment Facilities. Vendors are required to ship samples directly to the designated MTFs.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days to ship samples.  Samples must arrive at the MTF by COB, 5:00 PM PST, on the 14th calendar day after the notice to ship. Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.  The clinical evaluation responses are scored using a Likert scale with a range from 1-5. The scale descriptors are 1 = Does Not Meet Criteria, 2 = Partially Meets Criteria, 3 = Meets Criteria, 4 = Exceeds Criteria and 5 = Exceptionally Exceeds Criteria.  All clinical/performance criteria 
are weighted equally. The score of each criterion will be analyzed.  If the score of the clinical/performance criterion partially meets or does not meet criteria, that vendor will be ineligible for RIA award consideration.  The evaluations are conducted in a non-clinical setting.

A Clinical Product Team (CPT) comprised of medical professionals from several disciplines will evaluate the products based upon on the following evaluation criteria to determine acceptability.

Clinical/Performance Criteria
Clinicians will use each vendors products on at least 2 patients in order to evaluate the criteria.

Skin Staplers:

1.	The product performs without misfires or jams.
a.	Rationale: clinicians require product to perform rapidly and precisely without misfiring or jamming to insure proper placement on the skin and approximation of wound edges.
b.	Method: the clinician will perform skin closure with product and determine whether misfire or jam occurs.

2.	The type of product/size/rust free status are easy to identify from the package.
a.	Rationale: clinicians require the product type and size be easily identified from the package to increase time efficiency and avoid the time wasted in performing a long detailed examination of the product in its package.  
b.	Method: the clinician will determine if type/size/rust free status can be seen by quickly glancing at the package.

3.	The product is ergonomically designed for use with both hands and comfort.
a.	Rationale: product must be lightweight, ergonomically and comfortable to hold in either hand to reduce hand fatigue.
b.	Method: the clinician will use the product as directed and determine if it caused hand fatigue and/or discomfort.

4.	Easy to use with minimal training required.
a.	Rationale: clinicians require the product be easy to use with minimal training required to reduce clinicians time and effort of use.
b.	Method: the clinician will determine if the product is easy to use by reviewing written instructions of use and/or in-service training of the product by the manufacturer.

5.	The package is easy to open & allows for aseptic delivery to a sterile field.
a.	Rationale: package must be designed to allow the product to remain sterile during opening and placement onto the sterile field to prevent contamination and potential patient infection.
b.	Method: the clinician will open the sealed package and note whether or not the packaging is easy to open and the product remains in the sterile section of the package while being placed on the sterile field.

Staple Removers:

1.	The product performs without misfires or jams.
a.	Rationale: clinicians require product to perform rapidly and precisely without misfiring or jamming to insure proper placement on the skin and approximation of wound edges.
b.	Method: the clinician will perform skin closure with product and determine whether misfire or jam occurs.

2.	The type of product/size/rust free status are easy to identify from the package.
a.	Rationale: clinicians require the product type and size be easily identified from the package to increase time efficiency and avoid the time wasted in performing a long detailed examination of the product in its package.  
b.	Method: the clinician will determine if type/size/rust free status can be seen by quickly glancing at the package.

3.	The staple is easily extracted from the skin with the staple remover.
a.	Rationale: staples must be inserted in the skin in a manner that allows them to be easily removed preventing skin and tissue damage.
b.	Method:  clinician will use a staple remover to remove the staples and determine the ease of removal.

4.	The product is ergonomically designed for use with both hands and comfort.
a.	Rationale: product must be lightweight, ergonomically and comfortable to hold in either hand to reduce hand fatigue.
b.	Method: the clinician will use the product as directed and determine if it caused hand fatigue and/or discomfort.

5.	Easy to use with minimal training required.
a.	Rationale: clinicians require the product be easy to use with minimal training required to reduce clinicians time and effort of use.
b.	Method: the clinician will determine if the product is easy to use by reviewing written instructions of use and/or in-service training of the product by the manufacturer.

6.	The package is easy to open & allows for aseptic delivery to a sterile field.
a.	Rationale: package must be designed to allow the product to remain sterile during opening and placement onto the sterile field to prevent contamination and potential patient infection.
b.	Method: the clinician will open the sealed package and note whether or not the packaging is easy to open and the product remains in the sterile section of the package while being placed on the sterile field.

Phase III  Pricing Analysis Process.  All vendors who provide samples for clinical evaluation will be asked to submit best value pricing for analysis. Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of request to submit their best pricing, in a prescribed format, based upon the total requirements of the Southwest and Northwest Regions.  The Regions intend to evaluate pricing and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor pricing should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor pricing should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Regions reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if it is determined to be necessary.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs), (2) Potential Cost Avoidance, (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines, and (4) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than other pricing elements.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  Failure to submit a discount off the DAPA price will result in exclusion.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) as defined in FAR 15.201(e). The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) is requesting information on potential sources to provide or develop a non-toxic additive that can be applied to flowing water in unlined canals to reduce seepage losses.
The specific areas of interest include:1. A product that can be applied to flowing water that will react with the natural turbidity in the water, causing it to flocculate the turbidity to the bed of the canal.  Reclamation has demonstrated that flocculating the sediments entrained in many canal waters helps to reduce seepage losses in unlined canals. In lieu of a flocculant, other non-traditional alternatives will be considered that has the potential to achieve similar or better performance.2. A product that is relatively easy to apply and preferably in a dry form, for ease of transport, that can be broadcast across the surface of a flowing canal.3. A product that is derived from organic or naturally occurring materials.  Chemical alternatives will be considered as long as the product can be shown to be safe to the environment and human health (i.e. per items 4 and 5 below)4. A product, and associated biodegradable bi-products, can be conclusively shown to not be harmful to the environment, aquatic resources, or to human health through human/societal uses of the water.5. A product that will be able to comply with Federal or state water quality standards.6. A product that is significantly more cost effective than traditional methods of lining canals (e.g. concrete liners, geomembrane liners)
Reclamation has conducted and sponsored significant research and demonstrations to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of using polyacrylamide (PAM) to act as a flocculent in reducing canal seepage.  This effort demonstrated the effectiveness of PAM to reduce canal seepage, but introduced environmental and human health concerns associated with acrylamide when PAM was used for this purpose. Reclamation seeks to overcome these concerns with an alternative product.  The Report of Findings for this research and demonstration effort has been published and is available at: http://www.usbr.gov/research/science-and-tech/research/results/PAM/LA-PAM%20Report%20of%20Findings.pdf
Reclamation and the U.S. Department of Agriculture - Agricultural Research Service also organized and sponsored a workshop in February 2008 to further explore these concerns and potential alternatives.  The proceedings from this workshop have been published and is available at:http://www.usbr.gov/research/science-and-tech/research/results/PAM/2008%20PAM%20Workshop.pdf
This request is to gather information from interested parties and is deemed essential as part of our collaborative, deliberate planning process for future acquisition planning if the information submitted indicates a strong commercial capability exists for Reclamation's intended applications or for research and development efforts with qualified industry representative(s) to develop and commercialize the capability sought. Interested parties should review the attached documents and reply no later than April 30, 2010. Please submit information or your enquiries to Rob Brackett, Acquisition Analyst, Denver Acquisitions Operations Group at rbrackett@usbr.gov.
This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of the submission of contractor's information. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for proprietary information not properly identified. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations.  Response to the RFI will not be returned. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.

<DESC><strong>NOTE</strong>:  <em>This Request for Information (RFI) for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request of Proposal or as an obligation on the part of Federal Student Aid (FSA) to acquire any products or services. FSA does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI nor pay for the information provided. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges will arise as a result of submission of responses to the RFI and/or FSA's use of such information.</em><br /><br /><br />The U.S. Department of Education, Office of Federal Student Aid (FSA) is conducting market research for Title IV student financial aid origination and disbursement services. The Title IV programs for which FSA is responsible to administer currently include Direct Loans, Pell Grants, Academic Competitiveness Grants (ACG), National Science and Mathematics Access To Retain Talent Grants (National SMART Grant), and Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants.  In FY2009, the FSA originated over 16.2 million grants and loans, totaling over $66 billion in awards.  Based on the current and forecasted trend of schools switching to the Direct Loan program and the increase in Pell Grant eligibility, it is projected that total originations may double for FY2010.  <br /><br />Currently, Federal Student Aid utilizes the Common Origination and Disbursement (COD) system for the origination and disbursement of all Title IV aid programs referred to above.  FSA seeks new and innovative services that may support the current and projected volume of Title IV originations and disbursements. These services must allow FSA to process loan and grant originations and disbursements efficiently, in compliance with legislative and regulatory requirements, while maintaining the financial integrity of these critical Title IV programs.  The proposed solution may either run concurrent with the existing COD system, and/or eventually replace it. Please provide evidence of capabilities, knowledge, and experience demonstrating the ability to expeditiously meet this objective. Examples may include names and abstracts of similar work completed. In addition, interested parties are requested to identify any competition barriers. Responses are not to exceed ten (10) pages, double-spaced, and shall contain only substantive information.<br />

<DESC>The Governing Board intends to award a sole source contract to the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO) in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions. This solicitation will be awarded in accordance with the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 6.302-1(a)(2) as only one responsible source can provide the required services.
<p>The National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB) has important congressional mandates to set policy for the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) and to take appropriate actions that improve the form, content, use, and reporting of assessment results. The Governing Board also has responsibility to plan and execute the initial public release of NAEP reports. One key component for informing the Governing Board's work is through expanded outreach activities involving targeted audiences across the nation. As increased attention is drawn to the National Assessment of Educational Progress, it is important to expand involvement of state policymakers in providing information and input to the Governing Board on various policy initiatives.</p>
<p>NAGB requires the Council of Chief State School Officers Task Force for the National Assessment Governing Board to be convened for two in-person meetings next year and four meetings via webinar. Topics to be discussed by the Task Force include planning for 2010 NAEP reports, releasing reports from the 12th grade NAEP state-level pilot for 2009, 12th grade preparedness issues, achievement level setting, testing students with disabilities and English language learners, use and misuse of NAEP results, and other topics.</p>
<p>In addition, one Task Force member shall attend each of the Governing Board's quarterly meetings as an observer to promote communication between the Board and the Task Force. <br /><br />In accordance with FAR Subpart 6.3-Other Than Full and Open Competition, and under the provisions of FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source - the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO) - can provide the required information and outreach services representing all 50 states and territories within the timelines required for reporting NAEP achievement results. This coordination among all 50 states and the federal government is necessary for NAEP to be successful.</p>
<p>Organizations and persons may identify their interest in and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; NAGB will not issue a solicitation. However, all capability statements received by March 19, 2010 will be considered by the Governing Board. Attached is a draft statement of work. A cost reimbursement type contract is planned. Any questions or suggestions received before March 17, 2010 will be answered via www.fedbizopps.gov. Please submit written questions or comments to <a href="mailto:Moira.Baran@ed.gov">Moira.Baran@ed.gov</a>. The period of performance is from the date of contract award, anticipated to be approximately from September 20, 2010 to September 19, 2011.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Background</strong></p>
<p>Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), operated by UT Battelle, LLC, hereafter referred to as the Company, on behalf of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), Defense National Stockpile Center (DNSC), is considering the use of drum inspection services utilizing field deployable radiographic equipment and systems for identifying liquid mercury inside 30-gal drums.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Three drums each containing six 3-liter steel flasks with 76-lbs of elemental mercury per flask will be test-inspected. A quantity of free liquid mercury is contained inside the drum, external to the flasks, to simulate a flask that has leaked. The Seller will be asked to determine the presence of free mercury, estimate the quantity of free mercury, and provide supporting documentation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Purpose</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of the Expression of Interest (EOI) is to establish a list of qualified companies for a Request for Proposal (RFP) to conduct a test inspection of three drums.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For successful participants there will be a follow-on RFP in CY-2011 that involves field deployment of real time radiography (RTR) equipment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To be considered for the test inspection and possible future deployment, the Seller shall provide documentation of past field deployment experience including references with current contact information, and documentation to verify their RTR capabilities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For the test inspection, the Seller shall demonstrate for each of the three drums the ability to determine (a) if any amount of free liquid mercury (simulated leak) is contained in the drum outside of the flasks and (b) if a simulated flask leak exists, attempt to quantify the volume of free mercury inside the drum.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A report shall be provided to the company comprising a system description, results, multiple images, and video.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Drum Configuration and Miscellaneous Details</strong></p>
<p>Three 30-gal drums each containing ~ 480 lbs of mercury contained in six steel flasks will be shipped for test-inspection to the Seller's facility or at the location where the Seller's radiography equipment is deployed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The mercury flasks are separated by a cardboard divider to prevent them from contacting each other.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A 10 inch x 10 inch pillow is located under the flasks and a cardboard divider, to dampen vibration during transportation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A complete description of the arrangement inside the drums will be made available in the RFP. A quantity of free mercury has been added directly onto the pillow to simulate a flask leak.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The pillow will not absorb the mercury.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The free mercury will move about during transportation and is unlikely to completely remain on the pillow.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

<DESC>PROPOSED REQUIREMENT TITLE:
HHS-BARDA-Sources Sought Egg Supply-Mar 2010: Continuous Supply of Embryonated Eggs and Clinical Batch Production for National Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Efforts 
-------------------------
THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY.

This Sources Sought Notice (SSN) is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) and does not constitute a commitment by the United States Government (USG). The USG is currently conducting market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation, Part 10, to identify potential sources to provide the requirement and gather information on current capabilities within the market.  All information submitted in response to this sources sought notice is voluntary and the USG will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the USG.  Proprietary information submitted should be marked appropriately.  All submitted information shall remain with the USG and will not be returned.

The Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) has a future requirement to support the programs mission of , A Nation Prepared, to rapidly respond and produce a strain-matched pandemic influenza vaccine in the event of a declared pandemic.  Assuring this early availability of a sufficient quantity of vaccine for the U.S. population in the setting of a pandemic will potentially prevent thousands of deaths and save billions of dollars.

In 2004, the USG awarded a sole source contract to normalize the supply of embryonated eggs throughout the year and stockpile other critical materials for rapid pandemic influenza vaccine production, if required.  This contract also supported work to produce small clinical lots of inter-pandemic influenza vaccine for potential clinical testing.  This contract is to expire in March 2010.  The purpose of this SSN is to identify potential sources (large or small businesses) that may be capable of performing this new revised requirement.

This proposed requirement would support these services as well as reagent production and management of potential clinical testing programs.  Therefore, this new requirement would be a continuation of the existing requirements with a broadening of the scope of work (SOW) to incorporate materials and activities newly identified as essential to the mission of assuring the expedient supply of strain-matched influenza vaccine to the U.S. population during a pandemic.  Specifically, the USG contemplates a requirement that includes the following services:

1.  Maintain a continuous (year-round) domestic-based supply of embryonated eggs commensurate with the output of identified domestic-based commercial scale influenza manufacturing capabilities for the rapid production of matched-strain, monovalent pandemic influenza vaccine candidate, if required by the USG.  USG contemplates the pricing by a potential offeror will be on an eggs per production day basis.  The price will incorporate costs for overall flock management to supply the necessary laying hens to support daily egg production targets that match the current commercial scale capabilities on a continuous basis.  In addition, the price will incorporate the maintenance of a +20% egg production contingency (not to exceed 90,000 eggs per production day).   USG will support the costs of eggs produced and not used by commercial manufacturing activities.

2.  Manufacture, formulate, characterize, test, fill and finish 3,000 investigational doses of monovalent inter-pandemic influenza vaccine (at pilot manufacturing scale).  Strain selection will be at the direction of HHS.

3.  Manage to completion Phase 1 -or- Phase 1/2 clinical studies of investigation monovalent inter-pandemic influenza vaccine candidates.  Pricing to include all costs associated with necessary regulatory filings (i.e. IND).

4.  Create/ produce one (1) or two (2) reference strain reagents each year for shipment to FDA/CBER for appropriate calibration testing.  Pricing to include all necessary lab work required to establish a reference strain per regulatory guidelines.  Pricing to include the appropriate storage costs to maintain a reference strain library in which the contents are accessible to and retrievable by HHS upon request.

To be evaluated and considered for award of this requirement, a potential offeror must meet the following mandatory qualification criteria:

1.	The potential offeror shall demonstrate they currently maintain and have unlimited access to a U.S. based, FDA licensed, cGMP manufacturing facility that is currently, or has recently, been engaged with egg-based influenza vaccine production at commercial scale.

2.	The potential offeror shall demonstrate they currently maintain and have access to a FDA licensed, cGMP pilot scale manufacturing facility that is capable of egg-based inactivated influenza vaccine production.

3.	The potential offerors bulk manufacturing facilities are in compliance with current WHO guidelines for pandemic vaccine manufacturing including BSL2+ enhanced biocontainment facilities and procedures

4.	The potential offeror shall demonstrate they possess the appropriate facilities and skills to produce, calibrate and maintain reference strain-specific reagents for influenza antigens. 

5.	The potential offeror shall provide proof that their facility(s) and subcomponent contractors/ suppliers/ vendors have pandemic influenza plans in place to ensure USG contracts will be honored during a pandemic influenza outbreak.

It is anticipated that a Request for Proposal (RFP) will be announced approximately March 2010 with proposals due in April 2010. While the mandatory qualification criteria do not have to currently be met for this sources sought notice, all of the mandatory qualification criteria shall be met by proposal submission. 

It is requested that respondents to this sources sought notice may identify their interest by submitting the following information:

1.	An anticipated delivery schedule of the services outlined in the contemplated by the USG in the scope of work (SOW) outlined above.
2.	A brief capability statement, including how a potential offeror plans to meet the mandatory qualification criteria outlined above.

3.	Primary contact information at the organization (name, email, address and telephone number) handling this sources sought notice, in the event HHS has additional questions or requires clarification of the submitted information.

The Government is seeking qualified small business concerns and seeks to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUB Zone small businesses, service-disabled, veteran-owned small business, 8(a) small businesses, woman-owned small businesses, or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 325412.  The small business size standard is 500 employees.  Your response to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition strategy, including whether a set-aside is a possibility.  Teaming arrangements are encouraged.  Any organization, especially small business concerns that can perform the work are encouraged to apply.

Responses are limited to fifteen (15) pages. Data sets (i.e., tables, charts, graphs) and documents that are pertinent to the response can be submitted in excess of the fifteen (15) pages, as appendices to the primary submission.  Potential respondents are also requested to include whether or not they are a large or small business.  Small businesses are highly encouraged to respond.  All respondents and comments to this sources sought notice shall reference HHS-BARDA Sources Sought-Egg Supply-Mar 2010 and be submitted to Kyle Roberts, Contract Specialist, at kyle.roberts@hhs.gov by 1:00 PM EST, March 12, 2010.

This is a sources sought notice to determine the availability of potential small businesses (e.g., 8(a), veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business) that can manage and administer a large-scale, multi-site random assignment evaluation of promising subsidized and transitional employment approaches for critical low-income populations funded by the Administration for Children and Families..  The demonstration would target a variety of populations including: TANF recipients and those at-risk of long-term TANF receipt, low-income non-custodial parents, re-entering prisoners, low-income youth transitioning to the labor force, and low-income, at-risk individuals with disabilities.  The project will examine strategies aimed at successfully transitioning individuals in the aforementioned target populations from short-term subsidized employment to unsubsidized employment in the regular labor market.  These strategies will build on lessons learned from previous evaluations in order to develop and test new and innovative interventions designed to identify promising programs, and adapt to current policy environments at the federal, state, and local levels. Approaches of particular interest include employment programs that offer opportunities for substantive, productive work, strategies that couple work experience with wrap-around support services (e.g., child care assistance, skills training, job search assistance, career advancement services), those that result in physical improvements to the community, strategies that incorporate pre-employment activities, and strategies that target individuals with barriers to employment, such as little or no work experience, limited education, history of substance abuse, criminal background, a lack of hard or soft skillsoccupational or job-readiness skills  as well as jobs in high-growth industries, such as the health care or energy industries. Additional approaches may also be considered. The goal of this demonstration and evaluation is to increase our knowledge about the efficacy of programs aimed at helping target populations secure and maintain unsubsidized employment.

Core tasks of the contract include:  (1) establishing program/site selection criteria; (2) identifying and assessing potential demonstration programs based on the criteria; (3) marketing the study to a broad range of potential intervention sites; (4)  obtaining agreement from up to eight of those promising programs to participate in the evaluation study; (5) providing technical guidance to help demonstration programs meet evaluation requirements; (6) developing a plan for collecting and securing multiple rounds of survey and administrative data across sites; (7) conducting a state-of-the-art implementation evaluation; (8) developing, field testing, and obtaining OMB clearance for research-based, valid and reliable measures and data collection instruments including: survey instruments for the baseline and follow-up surveys a as well as protocols for the assessment of program implementation; (9) obtaining IRB approval of the study protocols; (10) collecting baseline and follow-up data, obtaining at least an 80 percent response rate at each site; (11) conducting an impact analysis based on survey and administrative data; (12) development of implementation and impact reports and briefs; (13) developing and conducting a cost-benefit analysis; (14) developing special topic reports;  (15) producing and securing data files and documentation including public use or restricted use files; (16) conducting project briefings; (17) managing the project and ensuring that all work is of highest quality, on time and within budget.
 
The minimum contractor requirements are:

1)  Demonstrate the capacity, capability and relevant prior experience to conduct a multi-site, large-scale experimental evaluation involving different populations in a variety of settings.

2)   Demonstrate prior experience and success in obtaining agreement of programs to participate in a randomized evaluation study.  

3)  Demonstrate capacity, capability and relevant experience to carry out critical tasks working simultaneously with geographically dispersed programs and providing technical guidance and managing large volumes of data for up to eight evaluation sites at the same time.

<DESC>The US Army Corps of Engineers, Army Geospatial Center (AGC), is a lead organization responsible for acquiring personnel, materials, equipment, facilities, and other supplies and non-personal services necessary to conduct research and analysis for the U.S. Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences (ARI).  The US Army is facing significant training challenges that result from the rapidly changing requirements of the contemporary operational environment.  With the rapid changes in and proliferation of training needs, the ARI must respond with training solutions addressing the needs of the force.  This response includes both training oriented toward current capabilities and training oriented toward new warfighting technologies. Training emphasis demands determining the appropriate balance of institutional training of Soldiers and leaders, the continuation training these individuals require once in their units, and also unit collective training. Research must address how to make such training effective and efficient, to include developing competent trainers and leaders to meet training and readiness objectives that respond to the operational environment.<BR><BR>The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to determine if there are sources capable of satisfying the government's requirement for ARI's support services.  NO PROPOSALS are requested or accepted under this RFI.  Feedback addressing the clarity, feasibility, scope and potential alternative means of meeting the government's requirement is sought.  The anticipated North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for this requirement is 541720.  The business size standard is $7.0M.  Your response should identify your business size (large or small) in relation to this NAICS code.  <BR><BR>The AGC is assessing the existence of sources and is requesting capability packages from industry on the requirements below.  Responses must be limited to no more than 10 pages and must address the following areas:  (1) knowledge and experience related to training analysis and leader development needs and requirements; (2) knowledge and experience on design and development of exemplar or prototype training and leader development methods; (3) knowledge and experience  related to the analysis, evaluation, and assessment of human performance, the impact of training, and the impact of leader development interventions; (4) knowledge and experience related to design, development and evaluation of methods for the implementation and management of training and leader development programs; (5) knowledge and experience related to design, development, evaluation, and incorporation of innovative state-of-the-art training delivery technology for training efficiency.<BR><BR>Interested sources are encouraged to submit company literature in response to this RFI.  Any submission of such company literature will be treated separate from, and will have no bearing on, any subsequent evaluation of proposals submitted in response to any resulting future formal Request for Proposals (RFP).

<DESC>RECOVERY:  THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  The Bureau of Land Management, National Operations Center (NOC), intends to award a call/task order against the competitively awarded Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) for GCDB and Land Records Services to procure services for Control Document Index (CDI) aperture cards in Colorado.  The BPA being utilized is L10PA00578, and was awarded to Premier Data Services through GSA contract number GS-35F-0418K.   The BPA was competed amongst GSA contract holders and Premier Data Services proved to provide the best value to the government.  This opportunity is only available to the current BPA contract holder.  This notice is not a solicitation for offers.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) package will be sent to the designated BPA contract holder.  This acquisition falls under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 518210.  Below is a general description of the services required.
This project will involve scanning approximately 500,000 land status records from micro-graphic copies of legal documents mounted on aperture cards.  The database this creates will enable the BLM to more efficiently evaluate leases for renewable energy or other projects more efficient, thereby saving the public and agency time in the application process.  This will also improve the automation and quality assurance of BLMs current land status information.

<DESC>Please read the ENTIRE synopsis before submitting any response.
<p>The 10th Mission Support Group, Directorate of Contracting, United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) Colorado has a Brand Name Only requirement for the purchase of Dell PowerEdge R710 w/Chassis for up to Six 3.5" Hard Drives &amp; Accessories. This notice document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-38, 10 December 2009. The North American Industry Classification System Code [NAICS] is 334111 and the size standard is 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>Dell Servers have been approved by the 10th Communications Squadron as the standard across the USAFA .mil network. Per AFNetOps Functional Concepts, para 6.5, "Standardization of configurations, processes, and applications across the enterprise, from the gateway to the desktop, will facilitate centralized management, enhance security through configuration control, and save manpower in cerfitication and accreditation, patch implementation, hardware/software upgrades, and asset tracking." Also per para 6.1 "Robust, redundant data paths and nodes with both physical and logical diversity are needed to maximize effectiveness and eliminate single points of failure. This will enable the integration of distributed capabilities, improve real-time detection/correlation of network anomalies, and give the AFNetOps Commander a comprehensive picture of any potential network degradation, outage, or attack. As importantly, it will help the NetOps community better understand the impact of network actions nad the war-fighting operations that rely on their support."</p>
<p>This guidance lends itself to procuring, configuring and maintaining one standard platform per network that can be cannibalized if necessary, switched out with no impacts and easily repaired physically or remotely when needed. Also, a single platform is easier to track when products are under warranty.</p>
<p>Delivery is to be made to the IT Accountability Office at the U.S. Air Force Academy.<br />FOB: Destination. <br />Unique Item Identifier (UID) [DFARS 252.211] applies to this requirement.</p>
<p>This synopsis is for notification purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals. DO NOT SUBMIT A QUOTE AT THIS TIME.</p>
<p>Any offerors believing they can provide an equal product that meets all of the features and functionality described above of the Dell PowerEdge R710 w/Chassis for up to Six 3.5" Hard Drives &amp; Accessories may provide evidence for consideration. Evidence must support the offeror's claim they can provide an equal product. It is the offerors responsibility to prove their product is an equal by demonstrating their product, at a minimum, has the same features and functionality of the brand name product. Providing brochures, specifications and/or quotes alone is not enough for the Government to make a decision. The offeror should provide an understandable comparison between the two products. The Government is not responsible for developing the comparison from insufficient information provided. All qualified sources may submit a response, which if timely received, will be considered by this agency. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether a brand name or equal procurement can be conducted. A determination that equal products exist based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Responses must be received by 4:00 pm on 10 March 2010. Responses received after this will be considered late IAW FAR 52.212-1(f) and may not be evaluated. <br /><br />The Government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this synopsis. Contractors must have a current registration with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at http://www.ccr.gov and with Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov.</p>
<p>Questions should be addressed to the Primary POC Karen Jackson, Contract Specialist, (719) 333-4060 or sent via e-mail to karen.jackson@usafa.af.mil. Alternate POC is Leslie Ryan, Contracting Officer, (719) 333-3961, leslie.ryan@usafa.af.mil.</p>
<p><br />5352.201-9101 OMBUDSMAN (AUG 2005)</p>
<p>(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).</p>
<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the USAF Academy Ombudsmen,</p>
<p>Kelly Snyder<br />8110 Industrial Drive, Ste 103<br />USAFA, CO 80840<br />Telephone number 719-333-2074<br />FAX 719-333-9018<br />email: kelly.snyder@usafa.af.mil<br />Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.<br />(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency. <br />(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer. <br />(End of clause)</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, Region Seven (7), Alaska, intends to award a sole source, firm-fixed price procurement to Bernard K. Schroeder Consulting.  The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, Region Seven (7), Alaska requires the sevices of modifying marine radar equipment, mobile set up of marine radar equipment and training to U.S. Fish & Wildlife employees on identifying and tracking Kittlitz's Murrelet.
Bernard Schroeder from Bernard K. Schroeder Consulting (BKSC) is an expert in conducting marbled murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus) population monitoring in remote locations of British Columbia.  He has unique expertise in the use of ornithological radar for monitoring movement patterns and populations of the marbled murrelets; a similar species to the Kittlitz's murrelet.  He also uses ornithological radar for assessing bird use at proposed wind power facilities.  During his work, he has instructed and certified surveyors for conducting marbled murrelet radar, nesting activity, habitat, and vegetation surveys on behalf of the British Columbia  Provincial Resources Inventory Standards Committee (RISC), Forestry Continuing Studies Network (FCSN), Canadian Wildlife Service (CWS) and the University of Victoria in Canada and the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife and Hamer Environmental in the United States.  BKSC will provide modifications to the AFWFO radar scanner and chassis for the purpose of ornithological radar work focused on the Kittlitz's murrelets and birds in the vicinity of wind power facilities. Equipment will be calibrated to be consistent with other modified marine radar systems in use on the coast of British Columbia for the purpose of surveying murrelet populations since 1995. BKSC has done similar modifications to marine radar systems for agencies such as the Canadian Wildlife Service, Environment Canada, and the University of Northern British Columbia.   
Work description:
Objective 1:  Modify USFWS-owned radar system for use in murrelet surveys1) Modify the radar scanners and chassis for the purpose of radar survey work focused on Kittlitz's murrelets. The modifications consist of disassembling the radar scanner units (both 6 and 4-ft) and adjusting the scanner internally to an inclined angle of 25 in order to utilize the full vertical beam width above horizon; changing the radar's chassis mount to adapt to a steel tripod and allow adjustment of the chassis and scanner from 0 to 180 for the ability to observe number of individuals, movement patterns and measure ground speeds as well as measuring altitudes.2) Tune and calibrate the system for conducting murrelet and other bird surveys. Calibration of radar power, gain and other settings will be conducted in the lab and field to ensure that sensitivity and accuracy of the unit is comparable to other modified radar systems currently in use for murrelet and bird-wind power related surveys in Canada and Washington.
Objective 2: Train USFWS personnel in the use of radar for conducting murrelet and other bird surveys.1) Train AFWFO personnel in the use of radar for murrelet and other bird surveys, including how to identify and quantify murrelet and other bird targets on radar, how to maximize accuracy of surveys, how to measure speed and direction of bird targets on screen, how to deploy and use the system in remote camp situations or on small vessels at sea, how to choose appropriate observation locations, how to deal with weather conditions and how weather influences radar accuracy, review power requirements and options for remote operations, how to package and transport radar equipment for helicopter travel, and how to ensure safe radar operation and safe battery storage and transportation. 
Deliverables: 1) A modified Furuno radar system that is ready for use in surveys of murrelets and other birds in Alaska. 2) A written Standard Operating Procedure for the radar scanner assembly and its use for conducting murrelet surveys.  This document will include setup of the radar mount, description of parts, and operational instructions.  3) The contractor will provide study materials for the 4 day training course.
This notice is not a request for competitive proposals and the Government does not intend to accept proposals received.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>USAID/Jordan intends to award a sole source modification to Development Alternatives Inc. (DAI) under award no. 278-C-00-06-00329-00. The estimated amount of this modification is approximately $400,000.
<p>The above contract was awarded to DAI on a Full &amp; Open Competition basis on March 28, 2007 for 4 years at a total amount of $8,863,437.00. The purpose of this contract is to initiate sustainable water demand management in Jordan by establishing and strengthening an institutional and regulatory framework. This requires building the institutional capacity for water demand management in the involved institutions, developing and supporting enforcement of laws and regulations for efficient water use, and to demonstrate selected water demand management initiatives to the public.</p>
<p>USAID wishes to Revise Task 1.8 under the existing contrcat "Introduce and Promote Drought Response Principles in the Water Community" to include an additional activity related to supporting the Ministry of Water and Irrigation in organizing and managing the International Water Association's Efficient 2011 conference that will be held in the Dead Sea. The conference will have several water efficiency tracks including one that deals primarily with drought management.</p>
<p>The required services include continuation and expansion of services of the same nature as described in the original statement of work of the original contract. Seeking new procurement to fulfill those expanded services will be duplicative, costly, and time consuming. This non-competitive modification is being proposed under the authority of AIDAR 706.302-70(b) (5). Interested organizations may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement or submit proposals. All statements of interest received within 15 days after publication of this notice will be considered by the Government. However, a determination by the Government not to proceed with this proposed contract action based upon responses to the notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>This is a Combined Synopsis/Solicitation for the Utility Privatization of the Pittsburgh Air Reserve Station Electrical Distribution System.&nbsp; This synopsis' pre-solicitation notice was FA3002-09-R-0020.&nbsp; The Pittsburgh Air Reserve Station (ARS) is home to the 911th Airlift Wing (AW), Air Mobility Command. The installation is located in the western portion of Allegheny County, Coraopolis, Pennsylvania, within Pittsburgh International Airport (PIT). The Base is approximately 16 miles northwest of downtown Pittsburgh located along Pennsylvania Route 60 (future I-376). The main base area is comprised of approximately 115 acres (12 acres government owned and 103 acres leased from Allegheny County) in the eastern portion of the Pittsburgh International Airport. The lease presents no known impediment to utility privatization. The Pittsburgh ARS electric distribution system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to the distribution system from the point in which the distribution system enters the Installation and Government ownership currently starts to the point of demarcation, defined by the Right of Access. The system may include, but is not limited to, transformers, circuits, protective devices, utility poles, duct banks, switches, street lighting fixtures, and other ancillary fixed equipment. The actual inventory of items sold will be in the bill of sale at the time the system is transferred. The following description and inventory is included to provide the Contractor with a general understanding of the size and configuration of the distribution system. The Government makes no representation that the inventory is accurate. The Contractor shall base its proposal on site inspections, information in the technical library, other pertinent information, and to a lesser degree the following description and inventory. Specifically excluded from the electric distribution system privatization are:<br />&bull; Airfield Lighting (Apron lighting is included in the privatization)<br />&bull; Emergency Generators<br />&bull; Parking Lot and Security Lighting<br />&bull; Duquesne Light Company utility poles that carry the primary electrical feeders to the Base that are located on the AF property but remain owned and maintained by the Duquesne Light Company <br />&bull; Clinton Outdoor Training Site<br />&bull; Morgantown Municipal Airport Air Force Reserve Site<br />Base electrical power is supplied to the Pittsburgh ARS substation by Duquesne Light Company (DLC) at 22.9 kilovolt (kV) to a common local bus. Pittsburgh ARS accepts power on the load side of the common local bus. The Pittsburgh ARS transformer primary is tied to the common local bus through fused cutouts. The Pittsburgh ARS primary, 4160V aerial feeders and pole-mounted transformers have been gradually being relocated underground (U/G) with new switching cubicles and pad mounted transformers. Approximately two thirds (2/3) of the base primary power has been relocated underground. The new U/G system requirement is dual rated to allow a change in the secondary distribution voltage to 12.4 kV. See paragraph J1.3 Specific Service Requirements regarding the need to discuss future overhead replacement prior to project initiation. The underground duct banks are buried 30" below grade in concrete encased PVC conduits (no spare conduits). Approximately 30% of the duct banks in the main base are installed under the pavement while approximately 70% of the duct banks within the airfield and POL areas are installed under the concrete.

<DESC>This is the Combined Synopsis/Solicitation for the Pittsburgh Air Reserve Station Natural Gas System. This synopsis' pre-solicitation notice was FA3002-09-R-0021. The Pittsburgh Air Reserve Station (ARS) is home to the 911th Airlift Wing (AW), Air Mobility Command. The installation is located in the western portion of Allegheny County, Coraopolis, Pennsylvania, within Pittsburgh International Airport (PIT). The Base is approximately 16 miles northwest of downtown Pittsburgh located along Pennsylvania Route 60 (future I-376). The main base area is comprised of approximately 115 acres (12 acres government owned and 103 acres leased from Allegheny County) in the eastern portion of the Pittsburgh International Airport. The Pittsburgh ARS natural gas distribution system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to the distribution system from the point in which the distribution system enters the Installation and Government ownership currently starts to the point of demarcation, defined by the Right of Access. The system may include, but is not limited to, pipelines, valves, regulators, and meters. The actual inventory of items sold will be in the bill of sale at the time the system is transferred. The following description and inventory is included to provide the Contractor with a general understanding of the size and configuration of the distribution system. The Government makes no representation that the inventory is accurate. The Contractor shall base its proposal on site inspections, information in the technical library, other pertinent information, and to a lesser degree the following description and inventory. Specifically excluded from the natural gas distribution system privatization are:<br />&bull; Building interior valves<br />&bull; Clinton Outdoor Training Site<br />&bull; Morgantown Municipal Airport Air Force Reserve Site<br />Pittsburgh Air Reserve Station (ARS) natural gas is provided by Dominion Peoples Natural Gas Company. Natural gas is supplied by a six (6) inch main line that enters the base from the northeast corner and passes through to the gas metering facility, Building 119. Dominion Peoples Natural Gas Company owns the gas main and Building 119, thus these components will be excluded out of the inventory. Pipe size ranges from one-half (1/2) inches to six (6) inches. The total estimated length is approximately 17,400 linear feet of piping distribution placed at an average depth of four (4) feet, with a depth range from 2 to 6 feet. Approximately 20% of the system is under pavement. The system is made of high density polyethylene (HDPE) piping, but there are large segments where the HDPE pipe was slip lined into pre-existing steel pipe. In short, above-ground pipe segments leading from the ground to the building meter or valve connection point, exists non-HDPE lined steel pipe service lines. Due to the small amount of metallic components in the system, cathodic protection is not present in the system. Normal base distribution pressure is 10 pounds per square inch gauge (psig). The system was upgraded in the early 1990s to HDPE piping. During this upgrade, marker tape was not installed where the steel pipe sleeve acts as tracer wire.

<DESC>This is a Combined Synopsis/Solicitation for the Utility Privatization of the Water Distribution System at Pittsburgh Air Reserve Station. This synopsis' pre-solicitation notice was FA3002-09-R-0022.&nbsp; The Pittsburgh Air Reserve Station (ARS) is home to the 911th Airlift Wing (AW), Air Mobility Command. The installation is located in the western portion of Allegheny County, Coraopolis, Pennsylvania, within Pittsburgh International Airport (PIT). The Base is approximately 16 miles northwest of downtown Pittsburgh located along Pennsylvania Route 60 (future I-376). The main base area is comprised of approximately 115 acres (12 acres government owned and 103 acres leased from Allegheny County) in the eastern portion of the Pittsburgh International Airport. The Pittsburgh ARS water distribution system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to the distribution system from the point in which the distribution system enters the Installation and Government ownership currently starts to the point of demarcation, defined by the Right of Access. The system may include, but is not limited to, pipelines, valves, fire hydrants, and meters. The actual inventory of items sold will be in the bill of sale at the time the system is transferred. The following description and inventory is included to provide the Contractor with a general understanding of the size and configuration of the distribution system. The Government makes no representation that the inventory is accurate. The Contractor shall base its proposal on site inspections, information in the technical library, other pertinent information, and to a lesser degree the following description and inventory. Specifically excluded from the water distribution system privatization are:<br />&bull; Irrigation Systems<br />&bull; Non-potable Fire Systems, including fire system water pumps<br />&bull; MTMA owned facilities located on Pittsburgh ARS<br />&bull; Clinton Outdoor Training Site<br />&bull; Morgantown Municipal Airport Air Force Reserve Site<br />Potable water is supplied to Pittsburgh ARS at two connection points from Moon Township Municipal Authority (MTMA). A 12-inch main enters the Base south of the main gate on Business Route 60 and splits into two 12-inch mains which feed the elevated water storage tank and the Base's back-up metering pit. Multiple access points allow better service and system isolation. The water utility system was constructed in the early 1950s and has been mostly upgraded to polyvinylchloride (PVC) and ductile iron pipe; however, it still contains a small percentage of cast iron pipes. Tracer wire was not used for some of the early upgrades (pre-1995) of cast iron to plastic pipe. Adding tracer wire to the system will be addressed over time as plastic pipe is repaired and replaced. The system also does not have cathodic protection installed. Waterlines range in size from small distribution lateral lines up to 12-inch water mains. Depth of cover over the water collection pipes generally varies from 3 to 8 feet in Pittsburgh, with an average depth of 6 feet deep. There are no domestic water supply pumping stations located at the facility. Two (2) 560 horsepower driven, fire system water pumps are located within a pumping building and are not included in the water distribution system privatization. Water distribution lines located at Pittsburgh ARS and owned by MTMA are also not included in the water distribution system privatization. A MTMA owned and operated 1.5 million gallon elevated water storage tank is located on the northwest side of the Pittsburgh ARS. The Base's primary water supply comes from the MTMA storage tank, is metered and then delivered into the distribution system through the Base's 8-inch main with an average pressure of 90 psig. The MTMA owns all lines and equipment up to the downstream side of the backflow preventers leaving the water tower and entering the Base. In the event that the storage tank cannot provide water to the base, water is supplied through the Base's back-up water metering pit located on Defense Avenue. This water main is owned and operated by MTMA up to and including the master meter inside this pit. The pair of backflow preventers is downstream of the meter and is included in the privatization contract. Approximately 45 percent of the system is under asphalt on the Main Base, and approximately 70 percent of the system is under concrete in the Airfield and POL area.

<DESC>This is a Combined Synopsis/Solicitation for the Utility Privatization of the Wastewater Distribution System at Pittsburgh Air Reserve Station. This synopsis' pre-solicitation notice was FA3002-09-R-0023. The Pittsburgh Air Reserve Station (ARS) is home to the 911th Airlift Wing (AW), Air Mobility Command. The installation is located in the western portion of Allegheny County, Coraopolis, Pennsylvania, within the southeastern side of Pittsburgh International Airport (PIT). The Base is approximately 16 miles northwest of downtown Pittsburgh located along Pennsylvania Route 60 (future I-376). The main base area is comprised of approximately 115 acres (12 acres government owned and 103 acres leased from Allegheny County) in the eastern portion of the Pittsburgh International Airport. The Pittsburgh ARS wastewater collection system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to the collection system from the point of demarcation defined by the Right of Access. The system may include, but is not limited to, pipelines and manholes. The actual inventory of items sold will be in the bill of sale at the time the system is transferred. The following description and inventory is included to provide the Contractor with a general understanding of the size and configuration of the system. The Government makes no representation that the inventory is accurate. The Contractor shall base its proposal on site inspections, information in the technical library, other pertinent information, and to a lesser degree the following description and inventory. Specifically excluded from the wastewater collection system privatization are:<br />&bull; Oil/Water Separators<br />&bull; Grease Traps<br />&bull; Storm Sewers<br />&bull; Clinton Outdoor Training Site<br />&bull; Morgantown Municipal Airport Air Force Reserve Site<br />&bull; Wastewater generated by the Pittsburgh ARS discharges into Moon Township Municipal Authority's (MTMA) 15-inch sanitary sewer main via four (4) MTMA owned manholes along the east side of the Base, after which it travels south to MTMA's wastewater treatment plant. The wastewater is not metered prior to entering the county's sanitary sewer system. <br />&bull; The entire sanitary sewer collection system measures approximately 17,000 linear feet and is comprised of clay and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe. Sections of PVC pipe have been installed with marker tape and tracer wire as a result of system replacements and/or new construction. No lift stations exist on Base due to the topography which allows all wastewater to drain by gravity. The wastewater collection system consists of main and lateral gravity-flow pipelines, brick and pre-cast manholes, and oil/water separators. <br />&bull; The system mains range from 6 to 8 inches in diameter while the laterals range from 4 to 6 inches in diameter. Depth of cover varies from 4 to 16 feet below grade at an average depth of 10 feet. Twenty percent of main base piping is assumed under asphalt pavements and five (5) percent of airfield piping under concrete pavement. The main system was installed during Base construction from the mid-1940s through the mid-1950's. The only significant modifications to the original construction have been manhole and minor line repairs in the mid 1980s and mid 1990s. In addition, newer lateral line service has been added for newly constructed buildings.

<DESC>This is a Combined Synopsis/Solicitation for the Utility Privatization of the Natural Gas Distribution System at Dobbins Air Reserve Base. This synopsis' pre-solicitation notice was FA3002-09-R-0024. Dobbins Air Reserve Base in Marietta, Ga., is located 16 miles northwest of Atlanta. Owned by the Air Force Reserve, Dobbins ARB supports more than 10,000 guardsmen and reservists from the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force. It is home to nearly 50 aircraft assigned to different flying units and boasts more than 7,500 take-offs and landings each month. Dobbins ARB is the home for the 94th Airlift Wing (94 AW) and Headquarters 22nd Air Force (22 AF). The Dobbins ARB natural gas distribution system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to the distribution system from the point in which the distribution system enters the Installation and Government ownership currently starts to the point of demarcation, defined by the Right of Access. The system may include, but is not limited to, pipelines, valves, regulators, and meters. The actual inventory of items sold will be in the bill of sale at the time the system is transferred. The following description and inventory is included to provide the Contractor with a general understanding of the size and configuration of the distribution system. The Government makes no representation that the inventory is accurate. The Contractor shall base its proposal on site inspections, information in the technical library, other pertinent information, and to a lesser degree the following description and inventory. Specifically excluded from the natural gas distribution system privatization are:<br />&bull; Propane Gas Tanks<br />&bull; Gas Generators<br />Natural Gas service is provided to the base from Atlanta Gas Light Company (AGLC) at a pressure of 5 pounds per square inch gauge (psig). The gas main passes through a metering station presently located just outside the main base entrance on the east side of Cobb Parkway near the Visitor's center. This facility is not owned by the USAF and is positioned behind chain-link fencing. All equipment downstream of the meter is presently owned, operated and maintained by Dobbins ARB personnel. The gas is distributed on base through underground pipelines; the system's average depth of burial is approximately four (4) feet. The 8" and 3" main lines run west along Atlantic Ave. Sections are aged from the early 1950s to 2005. Projects occurring from the mid 1980s to the present have included the replacement of gas main lines as well as lateral lines to buildings resulting in 1-1/2" to 8" PVC/HDPE. All other gas lines are assumed to be steel in a range from 1-1/2" to 6" in diameter. All valves over the size of 2" have been assumed to be underground, therefore requiring trenching and roadcuts upon replacement. In addition, it is assumed that 25% of steel pipe is under 12" concrete and 10% percent of PVC pipe is under 6" asphalt roads. The system does not include cathodic protection on the metallic lines. There are five metering points and several additional meters on base which are owned, operated, and maintained by the Air Reserve. The three stations located to the north of the main gate, respectively serve the following facilities:<br />&bull; An interruptible service main provides gas to the main base central heating plant (Building 728) and to the adjacent buildings 729, 731, 732 and 807. The central plant generates steam, which is distributed underground to approximately 14 facilities in the near vicinity of the plant where it is utilized for building and domestic hot water heating. The plant includes four boilers; each equipped with burners capable of firing with natural gas or No. 2 fuel oil. Total plant capacity is approximately 2.65 million BTUH. Fuel oil storage for the plant includes two, above-ground, vaulted 25,000 gallon storage tanks, installed in 1995.<br />&bull; A non-interruptible service main runs to the west, following the north fence line. From this main, a branch line is extended north, under South Cobb Drive, to the base gym, Building 486. This branch line was recently extended in a northwest direction toward Building 401. Immediately south of B-401, the branch again splits with a line serving B-401 and a line extended toward the north where it is split to form a loop serving the Visiting Officer's Quarters (VOQs) 451, 452, 453, 454, and 455. Beyond the branch line to the gym, the main proceeds west, located on the north side of and paralleling Atlantic Avenue. Branch lines from this main serve Buildings 700, 701, 745, 746, the Navy Clinic (B-550), and the Flight Simulator Building (B-600). The main continues west until it further splits into two lines. One line generally follows Industrial Drive where it serves Buildings 516 and 501; the other continuing along Atlantic Avenue where it serves the BX (B-530), the Georgia Army National Guard Buildings 554 and 555, and finally, Building 531.<br />&bull; A non-interruptible main serves the dormitory Buildings 800, 801 and 802; the consolidated open mess, Building 806; and the dining hall, Building 813.
<p>As noted above, a single/metering/regulator station is located to the south of the main gate near the Base Chapel. According to information provided, a non-interruptible main from this station serves the following buildings:<br />&bull; Buildings 829, 831, 838, 904, 920, 922, 945, 910, 931 and 965</p>
<p>Through a new main, the new metering station on the southeast side of the base serves Buildings 1011, 1012, and 1013 in the U.S. Army Reserve area.</p>

<DESC>This is a Combine Synopsis/Solicitation for the Utility Privatization of the Wastewater Distribution System at Dobbins Air Reserve Base. This synopsis' pre-solicitation was FA3002-09-R-0026. Dobbins Air Reserve Base in Marietta, Ga., is located 16 miles northwest of Atlanta. Owned by the Air Force Reserve, Dobbins ARB supports more than 10,000 guardsmen and reservists from the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force. It is home to nearly 50 aircraft assigned to different flying units and boasts more than 7,500 take-offs and landings each month. Dobbins ARB is the home for the 94th Airlift Wing (94 AW) and Headquarters 22nd Air Force (22 AF). The Dobbins Wastewater collection system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to the collection system from the point of demarcation defined by the Right of Access. The system may include, but is not limited to, pipelines, manholes, lift stations, valves, controls, treatment plants, and meters. The actual inventory of items sold will be in the bill of sale at the time the system is transferred. The following description and inventory is included to provide the Contractor with a general understanding of the size and configuration of the system. The Government makes no representation that the inventory is accurate. The Contractor shall base its proposal on site inspections, information in the technical library, other pertinent information, and to a lesser degree the following description and inventory. Specifically excluded from the Wastewater collection system privatization are:<br />&bull; Grease Traps<br />&bull; Oil-Water Separators<br />&bull; Septic Systems<br />&bull; Leach Fields<br />&bull; Pretreatment Systems<br />Dobbins Air Reserve Base has a sewage collection system that serves the majority of the site. The Wastewater collection system is operated and maintained by Dobbins ARB, and includes areas of the base that are occupied by various Reserve Units, including the Army and Georgia Army National Guard. Dobbins ARB does not maintain the Wastewater collection system associated with areas currently occupied by Lockheed Martin. <br />The majority of wastewater generated at Dobbins ARB is delivered to the sewage treatment plant, AF Plant No. 6, located on the southwestern side of the base. Lockheed Martin leases and operates AF Plant No. 6; Dobbins ARB does not operate or maintain the sewage treatment plant. Remote areas of the Base are served by septic tank systems which are isolated from the wastewater collection system. Wastewater from U.S. Army Reserve facilities discharges directly into a collector line of the Cobb County sanitary sewer system that traverses the edge of the base. <br />The installation's wastewater collection system is government owned and operated, and consists mostly of original vitrified clay pipes ranging in size from 4 to 10 inches in diameter, with later expansions consisting mainly of concrete pipe, ductile iron, or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe. The average depth of the collection system in 8' with ranges from 6' to 12', and an estimated 10% of piping is buried beneath 6" asphalt. Sewage is transported to the treatment plant via a network of six lift stations aligned along the collection system. The recent upgrades to the system have been those associated with the construction of new buildings or replacement of collection lines, in which case polyvinyl chloride (PVC) piping was used in place of vitrified clay or concrete piping.<br />Lockheed Martin does not meter the total volume of wastewater. Rather, the base is billed for sanitary sewer services based on total water consumption during the same period. This method is based on an assumption that 75 percent of the base's potable water consumption will re-enter the system as wastewater.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION: The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), Office of Indian Education Programs (OIEP) requires the purchase technology software for grades K-12 to implement the approved school curriculum. The Bureau operated schools has an exhaustive and comprehensive system for selecting the appropriate source for procurement of educational technology. The Curriculum Committee composed of teachers from the various subject areas and/or grade levels are responsible for reviewing and recommending curriculum software to the Bureau's IT department for the purpose of establishing or redefining information technology philosophy, objectives, concepts, and standards for improving education. The committee conducts curriculum research by telephone, visits with other schools, teacher training institutions, or test available software, and sources to obtain the best software for the school's curriculum.  All of these mechanisms are collaborative, recognized, and respect the expertise of the committee members and IT department. Upon conclusion of this process, the recommended technology software is tested and approved by the Bureau's IT department. Final selections of such software is approved and a recommendation is made to purchase. Only an approved software can used in Bureau operated schools. The Bureau schools are currently using PLATO proprietary licensed software in its course curriculum.  The Government would incur substantial unplanned expense by conducting another exhaustive and comprehensive review and certification process to locate and procure other licensed software that meets the current Mastery Series curriculum. The government would incur substantial cost and risk by changing or purchasing any software other than PLATO. In order for the government to be able to use another technology software, the Curriculum Committee and IT department would have to perform another comprehensive review plan to obtain funding. The delay and student education impact resulting in the interrupt in this purchase while a new review is being implemented is estimated to be financially significant and would take many months.

52.212-2  EvaluationEvaluationCommercial Items (Jan 1999) 
(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 

One award will be made to the responsible quoter who meets all the Technical Factors, has Acceptable past performance, and results in the Lowest Price to the government.

A.	Technical Factors

To be technically acceptable each quote must demonstrate it meets all the Technical Factors (including all subfactors) set forth in the attached Performance Based Statement of Work and Specifications.  This will be evaluated as pass or fail basis.  In order to receive a pass rating the quote must clearly demonstrate the ability to provide and perform all services and technical requirements described in the Statement of Work and Specifications.  A quote that is evaluated as fail for any requirement will not be considered for award.

B.	Past Performance

A past performance review will be conducted to determine whether the Government has confidence that the quoter can successfully perform the requirements set forth in the Performance Based Statement of Work and Specifications.  In conducting its past performance assessment the Government reserves the right to use both data provided by the quoter and data obtained from other federal Government sources.  Past performance will be determined on an acceptable or unacceptable basis.

C.	Price

To ensure fair price analysis, each quoters price for price analysis purposes will be determined by taking its grand total quote and subtracting the appropriate amount, as follows, to reflect favorable Premature Discontinuance Provisions:

 No discontinuance charges:  4% Reduction.

 Discontinuance charges greater than none but less or equal to 3 monthly lease payments:  3% Reduction.

 Discontinuance charges greater than 3 monthly lease payments but less or equal to 6 monthly lease payments:  2% Reduction.

 Discontinuance charges greater the 6 monthly lease payments but less or equal to 12 monthly lease payments:  1% Reduction.

 Discontinuance charges more than 12 monthly lease payments:  No Reduction.

 Discontinuance charges that are not quoted in terms of monthly lease payments will receive: No Reduction

Technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price. 

 The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). 

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

Offerors shall include a completed copy of the provision at FAR  52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items, with its offer.

(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; 
(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and

(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
(ii) Examples.
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

(1) [_] Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [_] does [_] does not certify that

(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies
(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and
(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  This acquisition is being procured using full and open competition.  

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Inorganic Chemical Metrology Group performs elemental and isotopic measurements using a variety of spectro-chemical instruments, fulfilling customer needs through the provision of NIST Standard Reference Materials (SRMs) and development of methods used for the value assignment of elemental, isotopic, and organometallic data to SRMs.  

A High Resolution Sector Field Inductively Coupled Plasma Single Collector Mass Spectrometer (HR-ICP-MS) instrument is required for interference free ICP-MS determinations of both total elemental and organometallic content as well as isotopic composition.  

LINE ITEM 0001: Quantity one (1) each High Resolution Sector Field Inductively Coupled Plasma Single Collector Mass Spectrometer (HR-ICP-MS), meeting or exceeding all of the following required specifications:

-Sample Introduction
The HR-ICP-MS must include a peltier cooled sample introduction system, inert Ni-plated interface, peristaltic pump, Pt ground electrode (for cold plasma operation mode or equivalent) and digital mass flow controllers. In addition, an ESI SC-E2 integrated, random access autosampler (w/o FAST option) with dual rinse stations and HEPA filtered clean enclosure or equivalent, meeting the salient characteristics identified, must also be included.  

The autosampler must be capable of sampling from racks housing micro and standard sample vials of 1.5, 2.5, 4, 15, 50, and 250 mL.  The autosampler must hold a minimum of two 3 x 7 racks (50 mL sample vials) and accommodate up to 10 additional standards.  All racks matching the aforementioned bottle sizes must be provided.

-Detector System
The detector system must consist of a single discrete dynode ion-counting electron multiplier or equivalent.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format specified in FAR 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.&nbsp; This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>This solicitation number is NHLBI-PB(RR)-2010-089/MKL and is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP).</p>
<p>The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-38.&nbsp; The acquisition will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR Part 13 to use simplified procedures for commercial requirements.</p>
<p>The procurement is being conducted on a competitive basis, as a total small business set-aside.&nbsp; The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541690 - Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services, and the associated small business size standard is $7.0 million.</p>
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA), for the National Center for Research Resources (NCRR), proposes to procure the services of a well-trained scientific medical professional to provide recommendations that shall be advisory in nature and to provide technical and medical support for clinical research study oversight and monitoring of NCRR sponsored studies and trials.&nbsp; The technical and medical support services shall include, but not be limited to the following:&nbsp; provide expertise to NCRR staff on specific studies and serve as Executive Secretary of NCRR Data and Safety Monitoring Boards, Protocol Review Committees, or as a Medical Review Officer for NCRR sponsored studies.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Overview/Background of Project</span></p>
<p>This project resides within the Office of the Director of the National Center for Research Resources (NCRR), specifically in support of the Senior Advisor for Informatics and Clinical Research.&nbsp; The NCRR provides clinical research infrastructure for medical scientists (including both NIH-supported investigators and those investigators supported by funds provided by other federal, state, and local agencies and the private sector) who conduct clinical research and supports career development of investigators who have made a commitment to focus their research endeavors on clinical research.&nbsp; The Office of the Director provides advice and resources to assist program staff across Divisions in their responsibilities for monitoring and overseeing clinical research studies and trials.&nbsp; In some cases, the studies require oversight by NCRR managed Data and Safety Monitoring Boards, Protocol Review Committees, and Medical Review Officers that are independent of the programs or Divisions that manage the studies.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Contractor Requirements</span></p>
<p>This position requires experience in clinical research and protocol design/development, as well as highly developed scientific and administrative skills.&nbsp; Timely handling of responsibilities is required as tight timelines are in place for the scientific review of materials, protocols, and adverse events to assure the safety of the participants in NCRR sponsored studies.&nbsp; Significant administrative skills are required for establishment, management, and tracking of monitoring boards and committees.&nbsp; This may include emergency reviews or meetings to address emerging safety concerns or occurrence of serious adverse events.&nbsp; Thus, the time commitment must allow flexibility.&nbsp; The number of studies within the NCRR is variable, but can be significant, requiring careful planning and attention to monitoring schedules even in the absence of need for emergency review.<br /><br />Significant skill in the management of groups and individuals is required to assure the smooth functioning of any committee.&nbsp; Careful documentation of identified conflicts of interest and management is required to prevent contamination of the independent review process.&nbsp; Meticulous recording of actions is required as well as timely implementation.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall prepare and submit Technical Progress Reports on a monthly basis.&nbsp; The Technical Progress Reports shall include a listing of activities inclusive of, but not limited to, significant advances achieved, modifications, problems, and recommended solutions enacted, that occur within the contractor's assigned portfolio of responsibilities.&nbsp; This should be presented in sufficient detail that the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) can evaluate the effectiveness of the contractor's effort.</p>
<p>The level of effort, for this requirement, is based on an hourly rate of a scientific medical professional to provide the services described above.&nbsp; The number of hours shall not exceed 1,040 hours over a twelve (12) month period.&nbsp; The total effort, in labor hours, will be reported monthly and serve as the basis for payment.&nbsp; The proposed period of performance for these services will consist of one twelve (12) month basic contract period, and shall include options to renew for four (4) successive twelve (12) month periods.&nbsp; It is anticipated that work, under the proposed contract, will begin on or about March 31, 2010.</p>

Quoters lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  However, the quote of a company with no relevant past performance history, while not rated favorably or unfavorably for past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the responses of other quoters.  The quoter should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  The assessment of the quoter's past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the responder and other competitors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFQ.  The Government will give greater consideration to the contracts that the Government feels are most relevant to the RFQ.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

1.	IDENTIFICATION OF AGENCY AND CONTRACTING ACTIVITY:	 	a.	Agency Name:		Military Sealift Command (MSC)				914 Charles Morris Court SE				Building 210				Washington Navy Yard				Washington, DC 20398-5540
	b.	Contracting Activity:		Department of the Navy				Naval Inventory Control Point				ADP Modernization Contract Dept.				Mechanicsburg, PA  17055-0788
2.	NATURE/DESCRIPTION OF ACTION:
Military Sealift Command requires new Memotec Frame Relay Access Devices (FRADs) to replace some of the Verso FRADs currently in use.  Verso is now doing business as Memotec.  There are a number of FRADs that have reached End-of-Life and are no longer supported or workable in the most current infrastructure. The FRADs are needed to support MSC's role in providing logistics support to the Navy fleet by providing vital communications capabilities for MSC's vessels.
3.	DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES:
MSC requires 65 Memotec FRAD's to be delivered to MSC to be placed aboard MSC ships. 	4.	IDENTIFICATION OF STATUTORY AUTHORITY:
This J&A is based upon the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1.  There are a limited number of responsible sources, and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.
5.	DEMONSTRATION OF CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS:
 Memotec FRADs were selected because they are the direct replacement for our currently installed or fielded FRADs and utilize the same proprietary protocol named PowerCell (PVCR) as was used in the previous model.  Their reliability and compatibility with existing MSC systems has been demonstrated and are needed to maintain MSC configuration control and management.  They have been proven to meet the harsh requirements and tight confines of shipboard use and are necessary to support shipboard applications critical to the MSC mission.  Any other manufacturer's product we try to add to this network will not be able to communicate with the Memotec equipment.
Military Sealift Command (MSC) must test every IT configuration and every piece of hardware, software, etc. being installed on board a class of ships. The platform is specific to previous images and deviating from the hardware configuration would cause significant rework and testing.  The existing platform is already an accredited system so going to a non-accredited system would also create significant rework for all channels of Navy Network Security.  Standardization plays a key role in the efficiency of our network operation.  MSC has extensively tested the Memotec FRAD's to make sure of their compatibility with existing systems on board ship and in the office environment. The hardware represented here has been tested and deployed as a standard configuration from ship to ship.  A different manufacturers' FRAD product/solution aboard ships would tremendously hamper operability, utility and familiarity with equipment needed to support critical missions, thus resulting in an increase of Total Cost of Ownership.
The Memotec FRADs are considered to be the best viable solution for this requirement.  Considering alternate brands is not a technological or economical option for this IT solution because of the proprietary protocol associated with this equipment.
6.	GOVERNMENTWIDE POINT OF ENTRY NOTICE/POTENTIAL SOURCES:
The proposed contract was posted at the Government-wide Point of Entry.	7.	DETERMINATION OF FAIR AND REASONABLE COST:
The Contracting Officer anticipates the price to the Government will be fair and reasonable.  A complete analysis of the contractor's prices will be performed in accordance with applicable FAR provisions.  Commercial price lists, procurement history and other available pricing information will be reviewed.  A determination of fair and reasonable pricing as required by statue and regulation will be made by the Contracting Officer.	 
8.	DESCRIPTION OF MARKET SURVEY:
The IT marketplace was surveyed to determine which companies provide FRADs at a scale appropriate aboard US Navy Ships. MSC has determined  based on the information provided herein and past history, experience and quality, that Memotec product has proven to be the best solution for the ships infrastructure.
9.	ANY OTHER SUPPORTING FACTS:
None	
10.	LISTING OF INTERESTED SOURCES:
None	
11.	ACTIONS TO REMOVE BARRIERS TO COMPETITION:
Future orders will be evaluated to determine whether an alternate brand can be used.  As information technology continues to evolve, other brands may become available for future acquisitions.  Therefore, evaluations and technical improvements may make other products suitable for future procurements.
12.	STATEMENT OF DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS:
	a.	Performance Period:  
	b.	Ship To/Place of Performance:  SRA International, 213 Tintern Court, Chesapeake, VA 23320
	c.	Estimated Value: 
13.	REFERENCE TO APPROVED ACQUISITION PLAN:
	An Acquisition Plan is not required.  This acquisition is below the thresholds prescribed in DFARS 207.103 for preparation of an acquisition plan.
14.	DOCUMENTATION FOR SPARE/REPAIR PARTS ACQUISITION:
	Not Applicable

The paper must meet all specifications set forth in this synopsis. The core must function properly with shifting of the paper or jamming. More than one non-compliant roll in the test group constitutes failure. Once SSA gives final approval of the test rolls, the Government will have an additional 30 calendar days to ensure that the paper has no detrimental effects on the printing equipment. Additional criteria that may be assessed during this period are: (1) the continued use of the paper must not result in the emission of odor-causing compounds such as sulfur compounds, chlorides, rein-based aerosols or organics; 2) any coatings on the paper must not cause fusing failures; 3) the paper must not cause fusing failures due to the inclusion of synthetic resins synthetic sizing agents or plastics; 4) the paper must not create excessive dust. The amount of paper dust and chads must not exceed 75-260 micrograms per cubic meter (SSA Health code standard) or cause printer malfunctions and operator interventions; and, 5) paper must not have additives or other conditions that reduce print quality. If the paper fails to meet these criteria during that period, SSA reserves the right to cancel the order. The contractor shall be responsible for any roll that cannot be used within 10 inches of the core, or for which the core does not function properly, at no additional charge to the Government. <br /><br />CLAUSES: 52.252-2 CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE (Feb. 1998) - This contract incorporates one or more clauses by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:</p>

This is total small business set-aside procurement. The Small Business size standard is $7.0M. The NAICS is 811310. The contract will be awarded in accordance with provisions of FAR 13.5. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protestor essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: Solicitation/Contract number, Contracting Office, Contracting Officer, and Solicitation Closing Date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protestors must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protestor's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protestor may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protest in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protestor fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (CG-9131), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurement, 1900 Half Street, Room 11-0402, Washington, DC. 20593.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<p>2. Line Item 0001 is hereby amended to incorporate changes to the technical specifications as follows:</p>
<p>2.1 Specification 3 is hereby amended as follows:</p>
<p>FROM:<br />3. Temperature Control: The temperature inside the chamber shall be controlled by drawing the main lab air through the chamber using a circulation exhaust fan. The operating temperature of the chamber shall be dependent on the temperature of the air in the main lab, the heat generated by the diffractometer, and how much air is drawn through the chamber. The Contractor shall provide a method whereby the temperature of the chamber can actively be controlled by monitoring the temperature of the exhaust air and controlling the speed of the fan. The sensitivity of the temperature monitor shall be &plusmn;0.05&deg;C or better. Preference will be given to greater sensitivity.<br />The temperature controlling system shall be software controlled and shall be able to provide a record of the chamber temperature which shall be available by direct data transfer to a computer through a COM port or USB port. The software shall be off-the-shelf software that shall record automatically, every minute, and directly download. The temperature controlling system provided shall work with a personal computer running Windows XP. The Contractor shall provide the necessary cable. It must be possible to disable the active temperature control and directly control the speed of the fan using the software control. A personal computer is not required to be provided as part of the temperature control system. The Government will provide a personal computer with the serial parallel and USB ports.</p>
<p>TO:<br />3. Temperature Control: The temperature inside the chamber shall be controlled by drawing the main lab air through the chamber using a circulation exhaust fan. The operating temperature of the chamber shall be dependent on the temperature of the air in the main lab, the heat generated by the diffractometer, and how much air is drawn through the chamber. The heat generated by the diffractometer cannot be accurately assessed because the x-ray tubes, which are the main source of heat, are water cooled so much of the heat generated by them is removed from the chamber by the chilled water line. The temperature of the chamber shall be actively controlled by monitoring the temperature of the exhaust air and controlling the speed of the fan. The sensitivity of the temperature monitor shall be &plusmn;0.05&deg;C or better. <br />Preference will be given to greater sensitivity.</p>
<p>The temperature of the laboratory at a single position near the chamber can be monitored. It is required that the temperature stability of the chamber will be ten times better than the temperature stability of the laboratory; e.g., if the laboratory temperature varies by 2.5&deg;C in a one hour period, the chamber temperature must vary by 0.25&deg;C or less over the same period. There is no humidity control specification for the system. The final operating temperature of the chamber must be between 20&deg;C and 25&deg;C</p>
<p>The temperature controlling system shall be software controlled and shall be able to provide a record of the chamber temperature and the laboratory temperature which shall be available by direct data transfer to a computer through a COM port or USB port. The software shall be off-the-shelf software that shall record automatically, every minute, and directly download. The temperature controlling system provided shall work with a personal computer running Windows XP. The Contractor shall provide the necessary cable. It must be possible to disable the active temperature control and directly control the speed of the fan using the software control. A personal computer is not required to be provided as part of the temperature control system. The Government will provide a personal computer with the serial parallel and USB ports.</p>
<p>2.2 Specification 4 is hereby amended as follows:</p>
<p>FROM:<br />4. Air Handling: The chamber shall have one (1) ball bearing exhaust fan mounted centrally on top of the chamber connected to one or more exhaust port holes in ceiling of the chamber. The fan shall not generate more than 55 dB of noise. The fan shall draw air through the chamber from four intake grilles located within 1 foot of the floor. The grilles shall have an area of 0.5 to 1 sq ft. Two of the grilles shall be located on the front wall of the chamber (side with door) and two of the grilles will be located on the opposite wall. All grilles shall have adjustable air intake louvers adjustable from the inside of the chamber.</p>
<p>TO:<br />4. Air Handling:<br />The chamber shall have one (1) ball bearing exhaust fan mounted centrally on top of the chamber connected to one or more exhaust port holes in ceiling of the chamber. The chamber exhaust/cooling fan must be capable of moving at least 100 cubic feet of air per minute through the chamber. The fan shall not generate more than 55 dB of noise. The fan shall draw air through the chamber from four intake grilles located within 1 foot of the floor. The grilles shall have an area of 0.5 to 1 sq ft. Two of the grilles must be located on the front wall of the chamber (side with door) and two of the grilles must be located on the opposite wall. All grilles shall have adjustable air intake louvers adjustable from the inside of the chamber.</p>
<p>2.3 Specification 6 is herby amended as follows:</p>
<p>FROM:<br />6. Cable feed through and interior cable trays. The Chamber shall have all of the following: (a) Three (3) 2" and one (1) 3" (inside diameter) PVC sleeved port holes through side walls; (b) Approximately 20' of cable tray hung from the ceiling.</p>
<p>TO:<br />6. Cable feed through and interior cable trays. The Chamber shall have all of the following:<br />(a) Three (3) 2" and one (1) 3" (inside diameter) PVC sleeved port holes through side walls;</p>
<p>(b) 20' of cable tray hung from the ceiling. The cable tray shall be two lengths each 10' long. It shall be suspended from the ceiling by rods or cables so that it is at least 6'6" but not more than 6'10" from the floor. It shall be of open channel type. The proposed type, materials and construction of the channel shall be specified.</p>
<p>3. The required submissions are hereby amended to add the following requirement to Paragraph 1 which reads "For the purpose of evaluation of Technical Capability, quoters shall submit all of the following:"</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX:  202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

Renewable Natural Gas/Alternative Methane 

Synopsis: The Alliance for Sustainable Energy, LLC, manager and operator of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is planning to replace fossil fuel natural gas used at its two research campuses located near Golden, Colorado with natural gas from renewable sources. 

The purpose of this sources sought notice is to obtain an expression of interest and capabilities of potential subcontractors and suppliers. 

Background: NREL currently has conventional natural gas fueled combustion equipment.  As part of NRELs mission to promote renewable energy use and to meet federal mandates to reduce fossil fuel consumption NREL is seeking renewable sources of natural gas derived from biodigesters, landfills, wastewater treatment plants, thermal gasification of biomass, or some other means.  The intent is for renewable methane gas to be produced at the feedstock source and transmitted to NREL using the natural gas pipeline grid.  In concept renewable gas would be similar to purchasing natural gas at the well head and transporting it to the end user.

NREL anticipates issuing a request for proposal in early 2010 to qualified sources.  In order to determine qualifications please provide the following:
 
1)	 Brief background of capabilities.
2)	 Previous relevant experience.
3)	Demonstrated ability to provide NREL with 30,000 dekatherms (dekatherm = 1 million BTU) per year of renewable natural gas/alternative methane and future ability to provide increased renewable natural gas/alternative methane.  Annual usage is expected to increase to 100,000 dekatherms by 2014 at the NREL campus expands.
4)	Delivery capabilities.
5)	Evidence of risk and risk management plan.
6)	Compliance with applicable California Climate Action Reserve protocol
a.	Organic Waste Digestion Project Protocol
b.	Landfill Project Protocol

Integrated Missile Systems, 3. Simulation and Modeling, 4. Target Systems, 5. Transportation Systems, 6. System Operational Analysis, 7. Battle Management Systems, 8. Fire Control Systems, 9. Directed Energy Systems, 10. Other Applicable Defense Infrastructure Applied Technologies. All development activities related to this BAA are subject to International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). Performance will require access to and/or generation of technical data the export of which is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act, Executive Order 12470, and/or DOD Directive 5230.25. This acquisition is not open to foreign firms. Any contractor or subcontractor considering this BAA can not have foreign nationals working on the effort. Foreign Nationals (also known as foreign persons) means any person who is NOT a citizen or national of the US; or a lawful permanent resident; or a protected individual as defined by 8 U.S.C 13 24b(a)(3). In order to streamline the proposal process and to assist offerors in determining whether to incur the cost of generating a formal BAA proposal, it is requested that the offerors first submit a summary concept paper for evaluation. From this summary concept paper the Government will indicate whether the subject matter technology described is of interest to the Government and whether a formal proposal would be likely to succeed. The Government, at its option, may provide comments that might be of assistance to the submitter in determining how or whether to submit a BAA proposal. Concept papers will be evaluated as soon as they are received. Acknowledgement of receipt of concept papers will not be made, and concept papers will not be returned. The Contracting Office will ask only those offerors with promising concept papers to submit full technical and cost proposals. The Contracting Office will notify offerors within 90 days of receipt of concept paper if a full proposal is requested. Concept papers not selected for full proposal submission will be disposed of in a manner that protects proprietary data. All proprietary material should be clearly marked. The summary concept paper should state the proposed technical concept including the rationale and objectives, methodology, expected results, and its contribution to the USA AMRDEC. In addition, the summary concept paper should include a period of performance, anticipated cost and offerors past performance on Government contracts. The concept paper shall be limited to 5 pages (8 1/2 x 11 single-spaced), of English text with one additional page for technical drawing if necessary, and shall be in MS Word for Windows format. All concept papers, proposals, written communications or documentation concerning this BAA shall be forwarded to the Contracting Officer, Ms. Zina F. Sith, via e-mail, zina.smith@us.army.mil, with a copy to Ms. Sharon Cook, via e-mail, Sharon.cook@us.army.mil. Facsimile proposal submission is not authorized under this announcement. No classified data shall be included in the concept paper or proposal. A review of concept papers by the Government will determine which efforts are of sufficient interest to merit a formal proposal. Concept papers will be evaluated based on technical merit and offerors past performance. Technical merit will rank significantly higher than past performance. If there is sufficient interest, a formal proposal will be requested. Contractors are not authorized to submit formal proposals unless invited to do so by the Contracting Office. This announcement is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to make any award or to pay for any response preparation costs. The cost of proposal preparation or response to a BAA is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resultant contract or any other contract and interested parties should be alert for any BAA amendments that may be published. Proposals may range from theoretical studies to a proof-of-concept that includes fabrication, delivery and test of prototypes. USA AMRDEC is interested in receiving proposals for the research efforts described under this BAA. USA AMRDEC contracts with educational institutions, nonprofit organizations, and private industry for research in those technical areas listed above. Awards as a result of this announcement will take the form of a contract. Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee completion and/or level of effort type contracts are expected to be awarded. For planning purposes, awards are anticipated in the $100K to $30M range for the basic contract with a period of performance not to exceed 36 months. In addition to the basic contract, up to four options can be proposed. However, the total contract value (of each individual contract) for the basic and options cannot exceed $75M and the total period of performance for the basic and options cannot exceed 60 months. This includes time for preparation, approval, and distribution of the final report. The following reports may be required (specific reporting requirements will be specified by the Government in the event a contractor is requested to submit a formal proposal): 1. FUNDS AND MAN-HOUR EXPENDITURE REPORT, DI-FNCL-80331/M, monthly; 2. TECHNICAL REPORT, DI-MISC-80508, as required and a one time Final report; 3. STATUS REPORTS, DI-MGMT-80368, monthly; 4. SOFTWARE PRODUCT SPECIFICATION (SPS), DI-IPSC-81441, as required; 5. SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PLAN (SDP), DI-IPSC-81427, as required. 6. PERIODIC PROGRAM REVIEWS (such as IPRs, SRRs, SDRs, etc.), as required. 7. DA Manpower Reporting Requirements. Long term proposa ls should contain a summary of the work contemplated for each 12-month period, so that contracts may be negotiated for an entire five-year project or for individual one-year increments of the total project. A detailed performance schedule for each discrete task must be included along with cost data to include labor-by-labor category. To be eligible for award of a contract, a prospective contractor must meet certain minimum standards pertaining to financial resources, and ability to comply with the performance schedule. This acquisition is not open to foreign participation at any level. The Government will provide selected offerors with proposal content requirements. Proposal content and format shall contain and not be limited to: (1) Statement of Work (SOW): The SOW should be a concise document suitable for incorporation into a resultant contract. It should provide a qualitative description of the proposed work, which should be described in terms of advancement, improvement,<BR>or end product to be developed. The SOW should state the objectives to be achieved and how these objectives would benefit the Government. These objectives should be stated in terms of their potential usefulness to the Research & Development and Warfighter communities at and supported by the USA AMRDEC. The SOW should also include a proposed schedule detailing significant milestones and deliverables. (2) One page Resumes of the offeror's key personnel (including alternates, if desired) who will be involved in the research. Documentation of previous work or experience in the field of the proposer is especially important. (3) The type of support, if any, the offeror requests of the USA AMRDEC, such as facilities, equipment, or materials. Any request by offerors for Government furnished property/equipment must be clearly identified in the proposal. The Government is under no obligation to comply with such requests. Thus, offerors should make provisions for alternate approaches in the event the Government is unwilling or unable to provide the requested property/equipment. (4) A statement regarding possible impact, if any, of the proposal's effect on the environment. (5) A brief description of your organization. (6) The facilities to be used for the work, if appropriate for and understanding of the proposal. (7) A listing of current similar R&D contracts along with Government POCs (contracting officer & technical) shall be included. The financial portion of the proposal should contain a cost estimate that is sufficiently detailed by element of cost for meaningful evaluation and must include sufficient detail to support and explain all costs proposed, giving figures and narrative explanation. Cost proposals must contain certifiable cost or pricing data, and shall be in sufficient detail to allow direct and indirect rate verification. The budget must include the total estimated cost of the project. The estimated project costs must be broken down for e ach year of the program to show the following: (1) A list of participants, not necessarily by name, showing the time and number of direct productive person hours (DPPHs) to be charged by principal investigator(s), research associates, and assistants, and the total amount per year to be paid to each from the project. For proposals from universities, the time and amounts to be charged should be identified by academic year and summer effort. (2) An itemized list of permanent equipment showing the cost of each item. Permanent equipment is any article of non-expendable tangible personal property having a useful life of more than two years, and an acquisition cost of $500 or more per unit. (3) A general description and total estimated cost of expendable equipment and supplies. (4) Contemplated expenditures for travel with brief explanation. Travel budgets that exceed $1,500 per principal investigator per year or that include foreign travel or travel by other than principal investi gators will require special investigation. (5) Other direct costs. (6) Cost for consulting services, if any, showing number of days, daily rates, and estimated travel/per diem costs. The need for consulting services must be fully justified. (7) Indirect costs indicating whether rates used are fixed or provisional, and the time frames to which they are applicable (e.g., a fixed rate may apply until a specified date, after which the rate becomes provisional). (8) The fee, if any, which the organization proposes to assess the research project. (9) Subcontracts and material costs proposed must be fully supported and documented (written quotes, engineering estimates, etc). Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d)), it is the policy of the Government to enable small business concerns to be considered fairly as subcontractors to contractors performing work or rendering services as prime contractors or subcontractors under Government contracts, and to ass ure that prime contractors and subcontractors carry out this policy. Subcontracting goals for small business are 40%, for veteran owned small business 3%, for service disabled veteran owned small business 3%, Hubzone small business 3%, small disadvantaged business (includes HBCUs/MIs) 5%, and women-owned small business 5%. These goals are to be considered when proposals are submitted. The Government anticipates that any contract resulting from this BAA will be funded on an incremental basis as provided by FAR 52.232-22 Limitation of Funds. Proposals will be evaluated on their own merit without regard to other proposals submitted under this announcement. The primary basis for selecting proposals for acceptance shall be technical merit, importance to agency programs, and funds availability. Management, cost realism and reasonableness, and past performance shall also be considered. The following factors will be considered in the evaluation of proposals received under this BAA.<BR>General: The government selection of the proposal(s) for award will be based on an assessment of which proposal(s) is/are the most advantageous to the government considering technical and management in accordance with the evaluation criteria, cost, best value considerations, availability of funds, and program balance, using the areas and factors set forth below. The Government anticipates multiple awards under this announcement, though no minimum or maximum number of awards can be guaranteed. THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SELECT FOR AWARD ANY, ALL, PART, OR NONE OF THE RESPONSES RECEIVED. Evaluation Factors for Technical Area: a. Overall Scientific/Technical Quality: The offeror will be evaluated on the overall scientific/technical merits of the proposed research and development. The scientific/technical merits may include potential for state-of-the-art improvement, with special emphasis on innovation, originality and uniqueness. b. Qualifications: Capabilities and qualifications of the key research personnel relevant offeror experience and adequacy of facilities and instrumentation as required. The offeror shall also be evaluated on past technical performance of current similar R&D contracts. c. Research and Development Contribution: Potential contribution of the proposed research to USA AMRDEC in the above technology areas. Evaluation Factors Management Area: a. Overall Scheduling and Planning: The offeror's approach will be evaluated based on the overall scheduling and planning for performance of the effort. b. Expenditure Control: The approach for controlling expenditures and labor hours. c. Past Performance: The offeror's past performance for similar work will be considered. Evaluation Factors Cost Area: a. Cost Realism: The proposal will be evaluated to assess the likelihood that the technical and management approaches proposed could be accomplished at the cost proposed. b. Total Evaluated Probable Cost: The proposal will be evalu ated to develop the Government's estimate of the most probable cost to the Government of successfully completing the contract using the technical and management approaches proposed. Relative Importance of Evaluation Criteria: 1. Technical: The technical area is significantly more important than the management area. The factors under the technical area are of equal importance. 2. Management: The management area is significantly less important than the technical area. The factors under the management area are of equal importance. 3. Cost: Although the technical and management areas are more important than the cost area, cost is still considered a significant evaluation factor. Proposed costs must be fully detailed and have a complete justification. The total proposed cost must be within the total contract value as specified in the Introduction of this BAA . Selection of proposal(s) for award will be based on an assessment of which proposal(s) is/are the most advantageous to the Government considering technical and management in accordance with the evaluation criteria, cost, best value considerations, availability of funds, and program balance. In some cases the merits of a particular proposal in a technical discipline may lead to a decision with respect to funds availability relevant to the Applied Technology Initiatives Directorate customer goals. This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is issued under the provisions of paragraph 6.102(d)(2) of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, which provides for the competitive selection of research proposals. Contract(s) based on responses to this BAA are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of PL 98-369, The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984. This BAA is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to make any award or to pay for any response preparation costs. This BAA shall remain in effect for a period of one-year from date of synopsis.

<DESC>Introduction:  Pursuant to FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b)(1), the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, on behalf of the Technology, Systems & Program Integration Directorate (TSPID) at the Natick Soldier Research, Development, & Engineering Center, intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order on a sole source basis to: Beyond Clothing LLC, a small business located in Seattle, WA 98108. This is the second phase of evaluation.<BR><BR>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  No solicitation document is available. <BR> <BR>1. Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs: <BR><BR>The garments that are being purchased from Beyond Clothing are a variety of military clothing items that provide environmental protection. The following items are being procured:<BR>1. Enhanced Advantage BDU Blouse<BR>2. Enhanced Advantage BDU Pants<BR><BR>2. A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights, etc.): <BR><BR>These items are made by Beyond Clothing only. Beyond Clothing participated in the initial development of SOF garments. They took that design, and with inputs from SWAT members, further developed the garments to create the Enhanced Advantage BDU Blouse and Pant. Beyond Clothing has the exclusive commercial sales rights to these garments. Consequently, they are the only commercial source for these items. In addition, Beyond Clothing has the ability to rapidly modify the design of these garments. Our intention is to conduct two operational evaluations and then using the operational feedback, make adjustments to these garments and procure another round of test articles for evaluation.<BR><BR>3. A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted:<BR><BR>A sources sought market survey (W911QY09SS0002) for approved military products was performed in MAR 09. Respondents were invited to a Vendor Day held at Natick on 30 APR 09 where products were exhibited to the APPS IPTs. These garments were developed for SOF applications which are very similar to tactical law enforcement. On 21 OCT 09, these products were selected by the APPS SWAT IPT, based on product characteristics and user priorities.<BR><BR>4. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:<BR><BR>These products are being procured as limited quantities of test articles for the planned APPS SWAT operational evaluations. Beyond has the capability to rapidly modify the design of these garments. Our intention is to procure a small quantity (QTY-30) of product to conduct initial operational evaluations (Phase I Completed) and then using the operational feedback from those evaluations, to make adjustments to these garments to improve their operational suitability and effectiveness. We will then procure another quantity (Phase II) of improved test articles for further evaluation. These items will be procured later as pricing for the modified garments becomes available. Should these items be determined to be operationally suitable and effective, they will be placed on the APPS SWAT authorized procurement list. Any future procurement from the APPS SWAT authorized procurement list will be made by state and local agencies under their respective local procurement regulations.<BR><BR><BR>5. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required: <BR><BR>There are no barriers to competition. No further Federal acquisition involvement will be required as this program terminates at the conclusion of testing. Any subsequent acquisition of this equipment will be conducted at the state and local level and is subject to state and local acquisition rules and regulations.<BR><BR>6. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement to the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division via e-mail to: steve.streeter@us.army.mil no later than noon on March 1, 2010.<BR><BR><BR>Contracting Office Address: <BR>RDECOM Contracting Center -  Natick<BR>CCRD-NA-SU, Natick Contracting Division<BR>Kansas Street, Building 1<BR>Natick, MA 01760-5011<BR><BR>Point of Contact:<BR>Steven Streeter, Contract Specialist (508) 233-5704<BR>steve.streeter@us.army.mil<BR><BR><BR>

<DESC>The NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) has reopened the opportunity for nominations to the bidders list for the provision of G/A/G Secure and ECM Resistant UHF Communication for Poland.

NC3A is serving as the NATO contracting agency for this project. NC3A intends to use the International Competitive Bidding (ICB) One Envelope Procedure, in which the price proposals are opened and evaluated and the bids ranked in order by lowest price. Technical Evaluation then commences with the lowest price bid until a fully compliant bid is found.

The estimated value of this project is not available at this time. The reference for the IFB is IFB-CO-12546-POL-GAG. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the same reference.

The successful contractor may be required to handle and store classified information up to the level of NATO SECRET. In addition, contractor personnel working on NATO sites will be required to hold individual security clearances of NATO SECRET. Only companies maintaining such facilities and personnel clearances will be able to perform the resulting contract. The contractor is responsible for ensuring that the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) forwards to the NATO contracting agency the NATO clearance certifications for all personnel assigned to the contract.

Bidders will be required to quote for the provision of ground, secure, and ECM resistant UHF radio infrastructure with the associated remote control capability, and with additional VHF- and UHF-band ancillary equipment to include hardware, software, documentation, testing, installation, training, and transition on-site support.

A minimum of one year warranty period will also be included for maintenance and support of the systems. Quotations shall be on a fixed price basis for the total of the contract.

Bidders will be required to bid for UHF radios that are capable of operation using the Have Quick II standard. If SATURN radios are bid, they must be capable of operation in Have Quick II mode. If Have Quick II radios are bid, it must be possible to upgrade the radios to the SATURN standard, while still retaining the capability to operate in the Have Quick II mode. In the latter case, the bidder will be required to quote for the related option referring to the upgrade of Have Quick II radios to SATURN. This option will be part of the evaluation.

The bidders will also be required to quote for options referring to additional equipment to be installed in additional sites in Poland. The options will be part of the evaluation.

The solicitation will require the bidders to guarantee that the radio frequencies specified are compatible with the regulations and controls of the nations and that national frequency clearances will be obtained as appropriate.

The bidders will have to take in to account that the installation will be performed on existing sites, which have electromagnetic and infrastructure constraints.

The solicitation will include a requirement for prospective bidders to demonstrate their ability to undertake this project, and mandatory criteria for extensive experience with the provision of similar types of systems.

BIDDING PROCEDURE

Before a firm can be nominated to the bidders list for this procurement, it must first be approved for participation in NATO International Competitive Bidding (ICB). The U.S. Department of Commerce is authorized to approve for participation in NATO ICB those firms with a facility located within the United States. Please visit the following website for a copy of the NATO ICB application:

http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm

A firm that has been approved for participation in NATO ICB must request that the U.S. Department of Commerce issue a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for each project on which the firm wishes to bid. A DOE is used to nominate a firm to the bidders list for a particular project.  The NATO contracting agency will not accept requests for nomination received directly from firms.

3. Anticipated closing date for receipt of bids: July 2010

<p class="MsoNormal">The purpose of this Amendment is to delete the current Proposal Summary Chart Template and replace with a revised Proposal Summary Chart Template, attached to the BAA.<span>&nbsp; <br /></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Original Synopsis Below.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Microsystems Technology Office&rsquo;s (MTO) mission is to exploit breakthroughs in materials, devices, circuits, and mathematics to develop beyond leading edge Microsystems components with revolutionary performance and functionality to enable new platform capability for the Department of Defense. To execute this mission, MTO supports revolutionary research in electronics, photonics, MEMS, algorithms, and combined Microsystems technology to deliver new capabilities to sense, communicate, energize, actuate, and process data and information for the war fighter.</p>
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal">MTO regularly publishes Broad Agency Announcements requesting responses to specific program topics. This announcement seeks revolutionary research ideas for topics not being addressed by ongoing MTO programs or other published BAA solicitations. This BAA is primarily, but not solely, intended for early stage research (Studies) that may lead to larger, focused, MTO programs in the future. Studies are defined as single phase efforts of short duration (&lt; 12 months) costing less than $1,000,000.<span>&nbsp; </span>Whereas proposers are strongly encouraged to submit Studies to this BAA, Multi-Phase Efforts will also be considered.<span>&nbsp; </span>Multi-Phase Efforts are efforts with more than one phase that may span longer than 12 months and that may cost more than $1,000,000.<span>&nbsp; </span>Multi-Phase Efforts must also cover discernable research topic areas that lead to clearly defined, quantitative technical metrics.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS AN AMERICAN AND REINVESTMENT ACT (ARRA) PROCUREMENT. 

THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY

The resulting contract will utilize funds provided by the AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT (ARRA) of 2009; interested parties are notified that the inclusion of unique provisions required in implementing the Act, including those for significant reporting and transparency, will be required of the successful bidder.

The purpose of this announcement is to make notice that the U.S. Forest Service contemplates releasing a solicitation numbered AG-0489-S-10-0321 on or about March 03, 2010 for the RECOVERY Hebo Ranger District Early Seral Restoration Project - Suislaw National Forest. If the solicitation is released, it will be released through this FedBizOpps website, and prospective bidders should visit this FedBizOpps website from time to time on or after March 3, 2010 to obtain a copy of the solicitation. All future information about this acquisition will be distributed solely through this website. 

Project Description: The intent of this solicitation is to provide services, equipment, and labor necessary for maintaining or restoring animal populations that need meadow habitat on the Hebo Ranger District.  The primary focus of treatments is controlling unwanted vegetation in or adjacent to meadows. Unwanted vegetation includes but is not limited to non-native grasses, noxious weeds, invasive species, fern, blackberry, shrubs, and small trees. Portions of some meadows are steep and will require good traction to complete treatments.
Treatment methods vary depending on type of vegetation to be removed and the ability to access sites with machinery.  Treatment methods include machine mowing and hand work.  Machine mowing is generally used where machinery has access and the unwanted vegetation can be treated with a mower (grass and small shrubs, blackberry, trees, etc.).  Hand work (hand cutting and hand piling) with chainsaws, weed-eaters, etc. is used where machinery cannot access areas that need treatment.
The amount of effort needed to control unwanted vegetation varies by site. For this solicitation the government expects 67.5 acres of mowing, and 56 acres of hand work.  
The Contractor shall furnish all labor, supervision, equipment, materials, transportation, supplies, (unless specified elsewhere as Government-furnished) and incidentals required to accomplish the work.

PROJECT LOCATION: This work is located on the Hebo Ranger District of the Suislaw National Forest.

PARTICIPATION: This project is set-aside for small business concerns. The NAICS code for this acquisition is 115310. The small business size standard is $17.5 million average income for the last 3 years. All responsible sources may submit a bid which shall be considered.

<DESC>The Governing Board intends to award a sole source contract to the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO) in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations Part 15,&nbsp;Negotiated Contracts. This solicitation will be awarded in accordance with the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 6.302-1(a)(2) as only one responsible source can provide the required services.
<p>The National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB) has important congressional mandates to set policy for the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) and to take appropriate actions that improve the form, content, use, and reporting of assessment results. The Governing Board also has responsibility to plan and execute the initial public release of NAEP reports. One key component for informing the Governing Board's work is through expanded outreach activities involving targeted audiences across the nation. As increased attention is drawn to the National Assessment of Educational Progress, it is important to expand involvement of state policymakers in providing information and input to the Governing Board on various policy initiatives.</p>
<p>NAGB requires the Council of Chief State School Officers Task Force for the National Assessment Governing Board to be convened for&nbsp;three in-person meetings next year and&nbsp;six meetings via webinar. Topics to be discussed by the Task Force include planning for 2010 NAEP reports, releasing reports from the 12th grade NAEP state-level pilot for 2009, 12th grade preparedness issues, achievement level setting, testing students with disabilities and English language learners, use and misuse of NAEP results, and other topics.</p>
<p>In addition, one Task Force member shall attend each of the Governing Board's quarterly meetings as an observer to promote communication between the Board and the Task Force, for a total of six meetings. <br /><br />In accordance with FAR Subpart 6.3-Other Than Full and Open Competition, and under the provisions of FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source - the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO) - can provide the required information and outreach services representing all 50 states and territories within the timelines required for reporting NAEP achievement results. This coordination among all 50 states and the federal government is necessary for NAEP to be successful.</p>
<p>Organizations and persons may identify their interest in and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; NAGB will not issue a solicitation. However, all capability statements received by March 19, 2010 will be considered by the Governing Board. Attached is a draft statement of work. A cost reimbursement type contract is planned. Any questions or suggestions received before March 17, 2010 will be answered via www.fedbizopps.gov. Please submit written questions or comments to <a href="mailto:Moira.Baran@ed.gov">Moira.Baran@ed.gov</a>. The period of performance is from the date of contract award, anticipated to be approximately from September 20, 2010 to March&nbsp;19, 2012 (eighteen months).</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY - THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS. INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL BE USED FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY. THIS CONTEMPLATED PROCUREMENT IS ANTICIPATED TO UTILIZE THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT (ARRA) OF 2009 FUNDING IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT RESPONSIBLE SOURCES CAN SATISFY THE REQUIREMENT. All responsible sources are encouraged to respond to this notice; however, sources that do not respond shall not be precluded from responding to any subsequent solicitation. The National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology (NIST) seeks information for a commercial molecular-beam epitaxy system (MBE). The MBE system will be used to make a variety of semiconductor crystal structures for our semiconductor quantum optics experiments. With near atomic-layer accuracy, a device structure can be built containing different material and alloy combinations of aluminum, gallium, indium and arsenic. The system contains no toxic gases and operates in a sealed, ultra-high vacuum chamber. We seek a module MBE system that can be expanded and that is completely computer controlled and automated. The cluster tool component must accommodate the semiconductor wafer manipulations. All responses should clearly specify that the vendor is interested in providing a complete Molecular Beam Epitaxy System (MBES). After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for an MBES that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that results would be conducted as a small business set-aside. NIST seeks information on an MBES that meets the following specifications, includes installation of the equipment in a cleanroom environment, and may require minor modifications in order to facilitize the laboratory for installation of the system: a. The system must be a fully computer automated, cluster-tool driven MBE system that can be used to produce ultra-high purity epitaxially deposit gallium arsenide, aluminum arsenide, indium arsenide and related materials and structures. b. The MBE system must have fully automated transfers and process controls, for example fully automated preparation, baking, MBE growth and, most importantly, fully automated transfers between these subsystems using a cluster tool system. c. The system must be a two-chamber MBE system with additional loading, preparation and cluster chambers: 1) The MBE chambers must have a vertical profile wherein the substrate faces downward during operation. 2) The MBE chambers must have ion and cryogenic pumping with a base pressure at or better than 5x10-11 torr in typical idle conditions, i.e., with all sources in growth-ready stand-by mode. 3) The MBE chambers must be fully liquid nitrogen cooled. d. The system must have a loading, preparation, and growth chamber linked by a central cluster tool found in the commercial semiconductor industry. 1) Integration of band-edge temperature measurement directly into MBE computer growth software in real-time. a) Integration of laser optical thickness measurements into MBE computer growth software in Real-time (i.e., crystal growth software run on real-time laser optical thickness Measurements). 2) Loading of wafers from a loading chamber into a preparation chamber (for 400&deg;C degas) then moving the wafer from the preparation chamber to the cluster took, all done automatically via computer control. a) Additional 150 ft of triax and coax lines for liquid nitrogen to connect the MBES to liquid nitrogen. b) 30 ft by 30 ft class 10,000 hard-walled cleanroom with hard-walled entry divider. c) (1) Solvent and (1) acid hood, support DI water system for hoods and other necessary subsystems, 8-port liquid nitrogen phase separator. 2. INSTALLATION: a. The main system fits inside an 8 ft x 8 ft area, but is broken down into smaller pieces for transport and moving through hallways. With electrical racks spread out to allow access, the system will occupy a room of 30 ft x 30 ft (see (d)(2)(b) above). NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 334516, as those domestic sources having 500 employees or less. Please include your company's size classification in any response to this notice. Companies that manufacture such systems are requested to email a detailed report describing their abilities to Carol Wood, Contract Specialist, at carol.wood@nist.gov, with no later than 3:30 PM on Wednesday, March 3, <br />2010.

Also, any short-listed firm selected to       proceed to the Request for Price Proposal (RFP) stage, or Phase II, must submit a fully-executed JV       Agreement from the SBA with its RFP response.

The Contractor shall perform services necessary to meet requirements of a 3008(h) Order issued by United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) to Camp Stanley Storage Activity, and miscellaneous efforts as required under CSSAs Environmental Program. <BR><BR>Specific work requirements are expected to include: environmental compliance assessments, topographic/hydrographic surveys, development of geographic information systems (GIS), geological/hydrological evaluations, Preliminary Assessments, Site Investigations, Remedial Investigations, Feasibility Studies, Proposed Plans, Records of Decision, RCRA Facility Assessments, RCRA Facility Investigations, Corrective Measures Studies, Corrective Measures Implementation; sampling/analysis of environmental media (water, soil, air) for hazardous, toxic and radiological wastes (HTRW); removal actions/interim measures and remediation; services for remedial actions and removal actions/corrective measures; technical report preparation (e.g., work plans; quality management plans; remedial investigation/feasibility studies, record of decisions, environmental assessments, environmental impact statements); fate and transport/groundwater modeling; laboratory analysis; data validation; preparation of baseline risk assessments; assistance with community relations and fulfillment of public participation requirements; bench-scale treatability studies; implementation of pilot-scale treatment studies, and characterization and disposal of investigative wastes. <BR>Work requirements are also expected to include other activities related to maintaining CSSAs compliance with environmental laws. This includes permit applications, preparation of Environmental Assessments and Categorical Exclusions, environmental audits, cultural and natural resource management, supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) equipment installation and maintenance, environmental management system (EMS), waste sampling and management, and other work as required by CSSAs Environmental Program.  The Contractor will provide the capability to execute multiple concurrent task orders for environmental services, ordnance and explosives (OE) projects, and projects involving both remediation and OE with a full range of services including, but not limited to: environmental compliance, investigations, studies, cultural resources support, natural resources support, engineering support, OE standby and construction support, remedial actions, and environmental and range operation and maintenance activities. Work issued under this SATOC will use Service (Contract Act).  <BR>Detailed Explanation of Specialized Tasks:  <BR>Trichloroethene (TCE) and tetrachloroethene (PCE) are a significant part of the remediation at Camp Stanley. TCE and PCE containing chemicals were used at Camp Stanley primarily as a degreasing agent for metal and electronic parts and two groundwater plumes extend off of the installation into several dozen private water wells.  The health effects from TCE differ depending on the amount of TCE to which a person is exposed and how long the exposure lasts. TCE exposure can be associated with several adverse health effects, including neurotoxicity, immunotoxicity, developmental toxicity, liver toxicity, kidney toxicity, endocrine effects, and several forms of cancer.  PCE is a central nervous system depressant, and PCE exposure can be associated with liver and kidney damage.  The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has set maximum contaminant levels for TCE and PCE at 5 parts per billion. Camp Stanley is regulated by both US EPA (under a 1999 RCRA 3008h order stemming from the solvent plumes) and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ).  <BR>Because of the TCE contamination, several specialized skill set are required.  Camp Stanley installed a large bio-reactor remediation pilot to treat TCE contaminated groundwater in 2008.  Unlike most bioreactors, this one treats deep groundwater (as deep as 400 feet deep in fractured Edwards karst limestone).  Westbay wells are also used.  Additionally, Camp Stanley uses soil vapor extraction (SVE) technology at several sites.  There are also vapor intrusion study and protection issues in buildings at Camp Stanley arising from the TCE contamination of the groundwater.  <BR>Camp Stanley also requires expertise in SCADA, a supervisory control and data acquisition system.  It is an industrial control system: a computer system monitoring and controlling water distribution on the installation, including water being injected into the bioreactor IAW a TCEQ Underground Injection Control (UIC) permit.<BR>Another specialized requirement is the need to address extensive lead contamination in soils from decades of small army range operations, which are still ongoing.  Camp Stanley has used Phosphate Induced Metal Stabilization (PIMs) to treat lead contaminated soils at many of its sites, some involving many hundred cubic yards of soil, and intends to use PIMS at more sites in the future.  <BR>Camp Stanley also requires unexploded ordnance disposal services as part of many of its remediation sites.  While only small arms (and some grenade and rocket) use is conducted now, historically, many different munitions had been used at Camp Stanley, such as Stokes mortars and a wide range of artillery shells. Finding 37 mm and 75 mm rounds at remediation sites is not uncommon.<BR>Lastly, another specialized need is for all fulltime personnel and project managers to have at least a secret security clearance.  The installation stores large quantities of arms and ammunition and has sensitive missions, thus access to the installation and security clearance requirements for long-term personnel are  much more restrictive than most military installations.  <BR>Estimated SATOC Capacity: $49,900,000<BR><BR>Estimated 1st Task Order for environmental services at Camp Stanley:  Between $3,000,000 and 4,000,000 <BR>SATOC Term: Ten (10) years (five year base and five 1 year options)<BR><BR>North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code(s) applicable to this acquisition: Primary NAICS Code = 541620 Environmental Consulting Services. <BR>Award will be based on overall Best Value to the Government.

This sole source requirement will be procured under Simplified Acquisition Procedures and Other Than Full and Open Competition and awarded on an Unrestricted basis.

Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the capability to comply with the requirements listed. Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the<BR>Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received, the Government will proceed with the sole source negotiations with Pantograms Manufacturing Company. Responses are due by February 11, 2010, 3:00 P.M. (CST).

<DESC>RECOVERY - PER FAR 5.7 THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY; THEREFORE FAR 5.203 DOES NOT APPLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR(S) UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER(S): R&D Maintenance Services, Inc., W91278-06-C-0038<br><br>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).<br><br>Furthermore, the existing contract must be used because:  1) The contractor must work in conjunction with government operated floating plant and personnel in order to set stop logs to de-water the structures.  2) A detailed scope of work can not be prepared.  The extent of the work and the resources needed can not be fully determined prior to setting the stop logs, de-watering, cleaning to remove scum, silt, and debris, and inspection.  3)  The required repairs could be extensive and require specialized expertise and equipment.  Miter gates weighing up to 365 tons may require disconnection from anchorage and jacking for repair.  Miter gates may also require specialized alignment for positioning; removal and installation of contact blocks; stressing of steel diagonals; and line bores of up to 13 inch diameter for gudgeon and anchor pin replacement.  The amount of necessary repairs cannot be determined prior to the closure and inspections.  4)  This contract enables repairs to begin immediately after and even during the inspections without a detailed scope of work so as to minimize the time the facilities are closed thus minimizing the impact on commercial shipping and the economy.    <BR> <BR>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using funds appropriated by the Act.  Acquisitions must comply with FAR, and to the maximum extent practicable, be awarded under competitive procedures as fixed-price (FP) contracts.  The Mobile District intends to use the current CPAF contract to meet it requirements.  Though not a FP contract, it was awarded competitively as a small business set aside.  The contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed.  Furthermore, the existing Operation and Maintenance contractor has experienced personnel that are already on site and ready to perform the work.  Accordingly, it is deemed to be in the best interest of the government and in compliance with the goals of the Recovery Act to use the existing Operation and Maintenance contract to accomplish the requirements listed above. <BR>

4.	Authority:  (Identify the statutory authority, FAR title and FAR citation permitting other than full and open competition.  It may be one of the following, but other exceptions may be used.)

        Action using simplified acquisition procedures (select one):

 FAR 13.106-1(b)(1):  For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold (SAT), contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g. urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand name, or industrial mobilization).

 FAR 13.501(a)(1)(ii):  For actions for commercial supplies or services greater than the SAT but not exceeding $5.5M, the correct citation is:  Test Program for Commercial Items, Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 as codified at 10 USC Sec. 2304(g)(1)(B), and amended by Section 807 of the Ronald Reagan National Defense Authorization Act of 2005.   [Note: this abbreviated justification form can only be used for actions not exceeding $550K.  Justifications above that value must be prepared using the format at FAR 6.303-2.]


        Actions other than simplified acquisition procedures (select one):

 FAR 6.302-1:  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, 10 USC 2304(c)(1).

          FAR 6.302-2:  Unusual and compelling urgency, 10 USC 2304(c)(2).

	 FAR 6.302-3:  Industrial mobilization; engineering, developmental, or research capability; or expert services, 10 USC 2304(c)(3) or 41 USC 253(c)(3).

	 FAR 6.302-5:  Authorized by statute, 10 USC 2304(c)(5) or 41 USC 253(c)(5).

	 FAR 6.302-6:  National security, 10 USC 2304(c)(6) or 41 USC 253(c)(6).


5.	Reasons for Authority Cited:

 (a) [For FAR 13.106-1(b)(1); FAR 13.501(a)(1)(ii), FAR 6.302-1 or FAR 6.302-2 cited above]   Explain why the intended contractor is the only reasonable source who can provide the required supplies or services.  Explain factors/unique qualifications such as proprietary data or exclusive licensing rights, if applicable.  If appropriate, discuss how the sole source action will avoid duplication of costs that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or the unacceptable delays to the government.  If unusual and compelling urgency is the basis for the justification, explain the chronological events leading up to the requirement and explain why time constraints cannot permit even a limited competition. 

MAK Technologies is the owner and developer for all of the proprietary software involved in this requirement.. No resellers exist.  Dugway Proving Ground currently employs the software and associated licenses for MAK Technologies commercial off-the-shelf tools and toolkits for distributed simulation. With MAK software DPG links, simulates, and visualizes a virtual battlefield. MAK products fit into the DPG simulation infrastructure and development toolkits to provide a platform for further development. 

Competing this requirement and awarding to a company other than MAK Technologies would require the government to purchase a new software platform and the associated simulator equipment. The cost of the MAK software modules was $35,300. Maintenance and module development (includes licensing) costs are approximately $81,360. Investment to date is $106,660. Competing this requirement would involve not only the purchase of software systems and equipment but require training and development that has evolved for approximately 10 years.  Costs incurred to date would not be recovered through competition.

Attached to this J & A is a letter from MAK Technologies stating that there are no providers of MAK Technologies products other than MAK Technologies North America distribution entity.
[e2]

 (b) [For FAR 13.106-1(b)(1); FAR 13.501(a)(1)(ii), FAR 6.302-1 or FAR 6.302-2 cited above] Describe the detrimental effects/serious injury to the mission of the requiring activity or to the government, financial or otherwise, that will result if this justification is not approved and the product or service cannot be provided by the intended sole source contractor.


 (c) [Only for FAR 6.302-3 cited above]. Award the contract to a particular source or sources in order to establish or maintain an essential engineering, research, or development capability to be provided by an educational or other nonprofit institution or a federally funded research and development center.  How will the requirement establish or maintain an essential capability for theoretical analyses, exploratory studies, or experiments in any field of science or technology; or how will the requirement establish or maintain an essential capability for engineering or developmental work calling for the practical application of investigative findings and theories of a scientific or technical nature?


 (d) [Only for FAR 6.302-5 cited above]. Acquisition will be made from one of the following specified source (1) Federal Prison Industries (UNICOR)?18 U.S.C. 4124; sole source awards under the HUBZone Act of 1997?15 U.S.C. 657a (see 19.1306); or sole source awards under the Veterans Benefits Act of 2003 (15 U.S.C. 657f).


 (e) [Only for FAR 6.302-6 cited above].  When disclosure of the Government?s needs would compromise the national security (e.g., would violate security requirements); it shall not be used merely because the acquisition is classified, or merely because access to classified matter will be necessary to submit a proposal or to perform the contract.  What security requirements would be violated as a result of this acquisition not being competed?  NOTE:  Use of this authority requires a signed memorandum by the West Desert Test Center Command or Garrison Manager.


6. Actions to Increase Competition:  Describe efforts made to compete the action, including whether a notice was or will be publicized as required by FAR Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under FAR 5.202 applies.  State what actions will be taken to increase competition before subsequent acquisition of the supplies or services is required.

Market research has been conducted for other providers of the same licenses. Web based searches and GSA Advantage yielded no sources other than MAK Technologies. MAK technologies was contacted and asked if they supported resellers, the response was no (see attached memo).

The requiring activity is anticipating  an Army developed product that will be a ?Government Off The Shelf? (GOTS) product. At some point in the future, this developmental product has the potential to replace the privately offered product. The Test Technology division will monitor the progress of this developmental system and request a demonstration at that time.

Other companies offer military type simulation programs. Companies researched were CAE/Pregasis and C4i MILSIM. These are commercial off the shelf products that provide military type simulation. These products will be reviewed along w/ the government GOTS product that is forthcoming. When the GOTS product is available will be the most opportune time to compete and review products. 


7. Market Research:  Describe the extent of the market research conducted to identify all qualified sources and the results thereof.

In addition, I<br />hereby certify that the determination to use<br />this procurement method is the most advantageous way to fulfill NLRB's need, that price and<br />other considerations have been taken into effect, that sufficient funds are available, that the<br />prices proposed are fair and reasonable and that therefore it is in the best interest of the NLRB to<br />award this Contract/Purchase Order on a Other Than Full and Open Competition basis, given<br />that competition of this requirement is not feasible or practical at this time.</p>
