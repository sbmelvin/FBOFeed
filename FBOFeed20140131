<DESC>DISCLAIMERS: The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Request For Information (RFI). As stated in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers, and shall not be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. As stated at FAR 52.215-3, RFI for Planning Purposes; the Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information.<br />&nbsp;
<p>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI): This RFI is issued for the purpose of collecting market research, solely for informational, planning, identification of capable sources/recommended strategy and if this effort can be competitive or a Small Business Set-Aside. The information provided in response to this RFI is for discussion purposes and any potential strategy that may be developed from these discussions would be the subject of a separate, future announcement.</p>
<p>The information received in response to this RFI may be utilized by the Government in developing an acquisition strategy, and requirements documents (i.e.; Statement of Objectives, Performance Work Statement, or Purchase Description). The Air Force requires that only non-proprietary information be submitted in response to this RFI. The Air Force shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for the use of any proprietary information submitted.</p>
<p>The Enterprise Tinker Commodity Council (ETCC) is a multi-functional team chartered to create innovative strategies to drive efficiencies and performance improvements to the USAF supply chain. ETCC is directly responsible for developing logistics support strategies for USAF managed aircraft accessories, instruments, and engine components.</p>
<p>PURPOSE: This RFI is intended to identify opportunities to increase efficiencies and effectiveness for the sustainment of Constant Speed Drives (CSDs) managed and repaired at Tinker AFB, OK. The ETCC is requesting industry input/advice for:<br />1) increasing piece part and end item material availability,<br />2) on-site technical / engineering support,<br />3) and depot maintenance process improvements</p>
<p>The ETCC has 2 proposed Approaches:<br />a. Improve piece parts supportability to reduce unserviceable Awaiting Parts (AWP ) with some AWP related engineering services.<br />b. A Public Private Partnership with the contractor providing management and engineering support, as well as having responsibility for activities to increase CSD availability and reliability.<br /><br />The CSDs have historically been plagued with a high AWP condition which drives a large quantity of unserviceable end-item inventory within the depot repair facility. In addition, these CSDs tend to experience a low first-pass yield requiring rework of the end-item. The ETCC is requesting ideas from industry that have encountered similar supply chain problems and successfully implemented change and improvements. The ETCC is open to effective resolutions ranging from solutions that reduce AWP conditions through supplying parts to a Public Private Partnership for creative management and problem resolutions. This future effort could include supply chain management, logistics, forecasting of parts, parts availability, reparable forecasting, obsolescence issues, and delivery of serviceable assets. Based on market research the Contractor may be responsible for recurring and nonrecurring engineering services and Contractor Integrated Materiel Management (CIMM) for the CSDs. The engineering support activities may include detailed design engineering, maintenance engineering, systems engineering, technical analyses, drawing and source data availability and updates, reliability/maintainability analyses, engineering support, and materiel deficiency reports analyses.</p>
<p>The ETCC is interested in developing a strategy that can produce measurable benefits within 6 to 12 months through guaranteed availability, improved reliability, reduced cost, obsolescence management, and/or other desired logistics elements. The ETCC intends to use various personnel including Advisory &amp; Assistance contractor personnel in reviewing and evaluating any responses to this announcement. As a follow-on to this RFI, the ETCC shall host an Industry Day. The Industry Day is currently scheduled for 27 Mar 14.<br />Date of Planned Industry Day: 27 Mar 14 / 12-4:00 PM, CST<br />Location: Tinker Business Industrial Park (TBIP)<br />2601 Liberty Parkway (29th Street &amp; Sooner Road)<br />Building 2, Conference Room "A"<br />Midwest City, OK</p>
<p>A notice of the planned Industry Day will also be published in FedBizOpps. Each company/team may send a maximum of three attendees. The Government shall not reimburse or be liable for any travel expenses. All expenses related to this RFI and/or industry day shall be at contractor expense. A fifteen minute one-on-one session will be available if requested in advance. Please identify those attending NLT10 March 2014.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTORS UNDER W58RGZ-14-R-0015. <br>  <br> ****ATTENTION****ALL FORMAL COMMUNICATION RELATED TO THIS ACQUISITION MUST BE DIRECTED TO William McFarland, Contract Specialist, email william.a.mcfarland22.civ@mail.mil. <br> ACC-RSA proposes to contract with Lockheed Martin Missile and Fire Control (LMMFC), 5600 Sand Lake Road, Orlando, FL, (32819-8907), Cage Code 04939, as a new follow-on effort for continued CFSR support for AH-64 D/E model airframe.  The period of performance including 1-year base and 4 1-year options totaling of 60 months, from 1 January 2015 through 31 December 2019.  To successfully provide the services required by the performance work statement the contractor and any associated subcontractor(s) must have access to the Apache Helicopter Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Lockheed Martin's proprietary data in order to train and assist United States Government (USG) personnel in maintenance procedures. <br>  <br> The authority permitting other than full and open completion is 10 United States Code (U.S.C.) 2304(c) (1); by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, entitled  quote mark Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. quote mark  <br> The proposed acquisition requires the use of the cited statutory authority for the following reasons: <br>  <br> 	a. The proposed acquisition is limited to LMMFC, 5600 Sand Lake Road, Orlando, FL, (32819-8907), Cage Code 04939. <br>  <br> 	b. To ensure aircraft readiness, technical expertise provided by the CFSR must be precise and reflective of all configuration changes.  LMMFC as the OEM is the only source capable of providing the specific support required for Apache M-TADSS/PNVS and Sensor systems services.   <br>  <br> As of this date no rights to the technical data have been acquired by the Government for a competitive procurement.  Lacking a complete Technical Data Package (TDP), the Government cannot complete this requirement without the risk of a break in service and subsequent danger of severe non-availability of depot level logistics support for the AH-64D/E Longbow Airframe Unique components.  The data acquired thus far by the Government is insufficient to allow another source, commercial or otherwise, to perform on the program without the Government assuming tremendous risk to the validity of the available data.  Competition without an adequate commercial TDP would not be in the Government's best interest.  As noted, LMMFC as the OEM is the developer and sole manufacturer of the Apache Attack Helicopter Sensors and the only source that can provide access to required proprietary data/factory technical assistance in a timely manner.   <br>

The standard must be powered by 120V, single phase, 60Hz, and 15A receptacle via a 6' electrical cord. Its trigger level must be variable between -5V and 5V when attenuation is set to 1X. The user must be able to select the slope control to both positive and negative. The sensitivity of the standard must be 20mVp-p in both channels, and the width of the hysteresis band of at least one channel can be varied between 30m to 10 Vp-p. The dynamic range, which is the minimum to maximum allowable p-p signal range, centered on the middle of the trigger level range, must be 60m - 10 Vp-p within 5V window. The standard must provide a way to select both AC and DC coupling.  <br>  <br> The temperature range when the standard needs to be operating is 23 10 C. It must possess a GPIB interface with mnemonics compatible with those of Fluke PM6681. The standard must contain programming functions for cursor measurements, histograms, FFT, generation of reports from acquired data, profiling (measuring frequency versus time); it must contain both built-in math functions, which include FFT inversion and frequency difference measurements, and built-in statistics functions, which include Max, Min, Mean and Standard Deviation.  <br>  <br> This is only a presolicitation notice.

<p>Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, Life Cycle Management Center, 2275 D Street, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, 45433-7228</p>
<p><br />This is a Sources Sought Synopsis; there is no solicitation available at this time. Requests for solicitation will receive no response. This Sources Sought Synopsis is published for market research purposes only. This Sources Sought Synopsis is conducted to identify potential sources capable of meeting the requirements for the procurement of Satellite Tool Kit (STK) software license renewal for The National Air and Space Intelligence Center.</p>
<p>NASIC analysts utilize Satellite Tool Kit (STK) software to provide an intuitive view of complex mission and orbit geometries in a physics based 2-D and 3-D space analysis and visualization environment. This powerful tool has proven to be integral to the work of NASIC's analysis. This software is used on UNIX and Windows based computers (NASIC's Cornerstone network architecture is UNIX-based). The STK software allows NASIC branches to analyze and visualize signal data received from other intelligence organizations. STK software has the essential tools to help NASIC analyze the performance and characteristics of aircraft and spacecraft. STK allows analysts to animate and evaluate objects in real or simulated time with preloaded or imported terrain, atmosphere and space data. The software is capable of limiting geometric, terrain, RF, radar and EO/IR models to measure behaviors against objective dynamic displays. STK also interoperates with standard tools and data from MATLAB, ESRI, and KML. STK software will augment the process of analyzing complex space scenarios and determining optimal solutions with the ability to present results in graphical and text formats for easy interpretations and analysis. Providing on-site technical support and classified telephone support, as needed, will ensure NASIC analysts know how to effectively employ STK software and produce expedited intelligence products.</p>
<p>The Air Force anticipates a Firm Fixed Price contract will be awarded. The Air Force anticipates a twelve-month license. The Air Force anticipates this acquisition will utilize procedures outlined in FAR Part 12-Acquisition of Commercial Items, FAR Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures and FAR Part 15-Contracting by Negotiation.</p>
<p>Information is being collected from all potential sources at this time. Firms responding to this announcement should indicate whether they are a large business, small business, small disadvantaged business (SDB), woman-owned small business (WOSB), 8(a)-certified business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB), veteran-owned small business (VOSB), or Historically Underutilized Business small business (HUBZone). The National American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this action is 541519, size standard $25,000,000.00. All prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database to be awarded a DoD contract. Prospective contractors are cautioned to ensure that the proper NAICS code appears in their SAM. The Air Force has not yet determined the acquisition strategy for this requirement, including whether a set-aside strategy is applicable. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that small business prime contractors must perform over 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14.</p>
<p>All interested parties shall submit a capabilities package. The capabilities package should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements. Recent, relevant experience in all areas should be provided, including whether this experience was as a prime or subprime contractor, whether it was in support of a Government or commercial contract and what the scope of the experience was. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided. Interested contractors will clearly explain how they intend to meet the stated requirements. Your statement of capabilities should include the following: Company Name; Address; Point of Contact; Telephone number; E-Mail Address; CAGE Code; Web Page URL; and Small business size certification if applicable. Please submit one (1) electronic copy of your response to John.Schnieders@us.af.mil. Statements should be submitted no later than 7 FEB 2014 11:59 AM E.T. The Government will endeavor to answer any questions interested parties may have. All questions must be submitted in writing to John Schnieders at John.Schnieders@us.af.mil.</p>
<p>The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this synopsis nor will it reimburse the contractor for any costs associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice. This synopsis does not constitute a Request for Quotation, Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor does this issuance restrict the Government's acquisition approach. The Government reserves the right to reject in whole or part any industry input as a result of this announcement. The Government recognizes that proprietary data may be a part of this effort. If so, clearly mark such restricted or proprietary data and present it as an addendum to the non-restricted/non-proprietary information. If the Government decides to award a contract for this or related effort, a solicitation will be published and posted on the FedBizOpps website.</p>

<DESC>This announcement is to all Small Business, 8(a) Small Business, HUBZone Small Business, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business and Women-Owned Small Business concerns that may be interested in performing a contract for the Mid-Pacific Region of the Bureau of Reclamation. The work to be performed is described below. Based upon response to this announcement, the Government may determine to set this acquisition aside or proceed with an unrestricted solicitation. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 237990 and the related small business size standard is $33.5M. This notice is not a request for proposal and the information presented in this announcement will not obligate the Bureau of Reclamation in any manner. The estimated cost of this project is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000. This procurement will require 100% performance and payment bonds. Work is located at Trinity Dam approximately 8 miles north of Lewiston, California, in Trinity County. All interested parties are encouraged to respond to this notice, by e-mail to edanger@usbr.gov not later than close of business on 02/14/2013. The information provided in this announcement is all information the Government has available at this time. There are no specifications, drawings, bid packages, or source lists available. System for Award Management (SAM) applies to this procurement. Prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) prior to award. Lack of registration in the SAM database will make an offeror ineligible for award. Information on SAM registration can be obtained via the Internet at http://www.sam.gov PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS OF WORK: The Trinity Dam Intake Mechanical Equipment Refurbishing Gate Shaft Refurbishing (Phase 1) procurement is a heavy civil construction project and requires the installation of mechanical equipment. This project consists of removal of calcium carbonate (Calcite) from a valve Chamber, portions of gate shaft, and gate slots; installation of pipe supports for 24-inch air inlet and 20-inch floatwell pipes; and designing, furnishing, installing, and testing an Electro-Osmotic Pulse (EOP) calcite mitigation system. The valve Chamber is located in the heart of the dam and access from below through a 1,242 foot long access tunnel, then by climbing two non-standard flights of ladders (aka Ship Ladders) in the access shaft, then traveling down an approximately 100 foot long tunnel, and passing a 42 inch diameter water tight portal. The valve chamber can also be accessed from above via a 375 foot high gate shaft. The Government assumes that small businesses may choose to operate under some type of teaming arrangement. **Please note** Joint ventures can be made up of multiple small businesses and still be considered a small business under the exception to affiliation rule, provided they are not affiliated in ways other than in the proposed joint venture relationship for this procurement. The Offeror and Teaming Partners will require strong construction management, construction experience, safety experience, and capabilities in high work and non-permit required confined space operations. The project's complexity, magnitude and quality requirements for the work inside the interior of the dam will require managers and supervisors with extensive experience and past performance managing and working on jobs of this type, scope and size. This work requires design and fabrication of scaffolds or construction aids, which must be transported into the dam via circuitous routes. This work requires removal of waste Calcite materials from work sites using scaffolds or construction aids. The Calcite must be transported out of the dam via circuitous routes without impacts to existing facilities, equipment, or impacting drains. This work requires surveying and documenting walls for cracks, pressure grouting the cracks identified on the cleaned wall and slot surfaces, and repairing joints and installing additional pipe supports for 20 to 24 inch diameter wet well and air vent piping. The Offeror must develop a plan and method to prove that the gate slots are 100% clear of calcite to allow the removal of the Gate at a later time. Removal of the actual gate is not included in this procurement. This work requires designing, furnishing, installing, and testing an Electro-Osmotic Pulse (EOP) calcite mitigation system. There is a positive security requirement at the site. PROVIDE TO THE GOVERNMENT THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION: Please note Teaming Partners and subcontractors experience may be used where applicable. Please provide information that addresses the following: 1. Business name, address, cage code, size classification based on NAICS size standard, socioeconomic classification (i.e. HUBZone; 8(a), etc.), and a point of contact. Also include the above information for any joint ventures/ teaming partners, subcontractors etc. 2. A positive statement of your intention to submit an offer for this solicitation as a prime contractor. 3. Describe your firm's or teaming partner firm's capability and capacity to obtain bonding for the construction project up to $5 million dollars. The Government does not intend to limit bonding or use incremental bonding. We will require 100% bonding for this project. 4. Describe your firm's approach to managing the work required for this project, including any planned Teaming Partners and the organization structure, roles and responsibilities, and the overall execution of the work. If a teaming arrangement is being considered, provide the details of the joint venture agreement. 5. Describe your firm's capability and approach to managing a heavy civil project with work described above. Provide resumes of key personnel that would be responsible for the management of this project.

<DESC>Expressions of Interest Sought Succeeding Lease - Dawson County, Nebraska
<p><br />The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Lexington, NE that will be expiring. The Government is seeking to lease approximately 5014 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space. The rentable space must yield a minimum of 4360 contiguous ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet (OASF). The lease term requirement is for 10 years. The space must be available for occupancy on or before 8/1/2015.</p>
<p>Other applicable requirements include:</p>
<p>&bull; 27 on site hard surface parking spaces, including 3 official Government vehicles<br />&bull; Specific Information Technology requirements</p>
<p>The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.</p>

<DESC>Background: The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) continues to have a need for storage, monitoring and distributing blood, urine, tissue and other human biosamples. At this time, approximately 5.1 million vials of biological specimens need to be stored; 60,000 at ambient temperature; 1,450,000 at -20oC; 3,500,000 at -70oC; and 155,000 in liquid nitrogen. It is anticipated over the life of the project that biospecimens will continue to be added to this repository. Though exact numbers are not known at this time, we anticipate the addition of 500,000 biospecimens a year, with the majority requiring storage at -70. The following criteria define NICHD's need for the repository.
<p>Purpose of this Announcement: This is a Small Business Sources sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; 8(a) small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification system (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. The requirement is assigned a code of 541712 in the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), and the small business size standard for such requirements is 500 employees or less.</p>
<p>Project Requirements: The proposed acquisition will involve the following types of activities:<br />A. Safely and efficiently assume all repository activities from the current Repository, ensuring a transition without loss of time or loss of resources in a manner that does not pose obstacles to the conduct of ongoing research<br />B. Secure, receive, catalog, process, store, and disburse human biological specimens from NICHD sponsored studies<br />C. Provide adequate storage facilities and equipment for securing, cataloging, processing, storing, and disbursing clinical specimens following Biospecimen Repository Best Practices as defined by the NCI<br />D. Provide technical assistance and training, and communicate with the NICHD Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) to provide information on repository activities<br />E. Develop, perform, and maintain Quality Assurance systems for the NICHD Repository facility, operations, stored specimens, shipping materials, and personnel in accordance with all applicable Federal, State, and local regulations<br />F. Provide a web-based computerized inventory database management and sample tracking system that supports NICHD repository functions<br />G. Provide a technical and administrative infrastructure to ensure efficient planning, initiation, implementation, and management of NICHD repository activities<br />H. Provide for expanded services to include additional collections. It is anticipated that 1.5 collections a year will need to be catalogued and housed in the repository<br />I. Develop and implement a Final Transition Plan to ensure proper documentation and storage of human specimens upon the termination of this contract</p>
<p>Anticipated Period of Performance: The anticipated period of performance is ten (10) years beginning in about September 2014 under the umbrella contract of an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ).</p>
<p>Capability Statement/Information: The NICHD is seeking Small Businesses capable of meeting the following criteria. Small Business organizations must submit Capability Statements in response to this notice and that will be evaluated against the following technical areas of experience and expertise: a) Respondents must document the capacity for the requisite storage space. This includes the approximately 5.1 M existing biospecimens in addition to the anticipated increase over the life of the contract, as stated in the Background above. Building(s) must be equipped with adequate and appropriate monitoring facilities and back-up electrical power source(s). Building(s) must have adequate capacity to keep ambient temperatures within normal limits to ensure no undue wear on freezers. Building space must be flexible to accommodate new freezers as requested. b) Respondents must have a computerized inventory system that is able to locate every sample in storage. It must be a web-based system accessible to NICHD and approved users. It must be a system able to manage a repository of this size, and able to produce reports for NICHD based on subject ID number and date the specimen was drawn, as well as other specified information stored in the database. Since the information collected on the samples from each of the programs differs, the inventory system must be able to accommodate from 3 to 30 items per specimen, including, but not limited to, tracking data for in/out status, volume of specimen, and number of times thawed. c) Respondents must demonstrate capability of retrieving specimens from inventory, aliquoting them into a new container, generating and attaching an appropriate barcoded label, and shipping them to designated locations upon request. Respondents must demonstrate the ability to generate and read 2D and 3D barcode specimen labels. Respondents must demonstrate the capability to receive large shipments of new specimens into the repository (up to 50,000 per week), to catalog them into the database, and to return to inventory all unused portions. Respondents must demonstrate the capacity to generate automatic reports regarding receipt and disbursement of shipments.</p>
<p>CONFIDENTIALITY: No proprietary, classified, confidential, or sensitive information should be included in your response. The government reserves the right to use any non-proprietary technical information in any resultant solicitation(s).</p>
<p>Disclaimer and Important Notes: This notice does not obligate the government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Any organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed to allow the Government to determine the organization's qualifications to perform the work.

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   
XXXX, is a highly specialized expert who has worked with VA data for over 15 years. She is experienced with querying data from Austin, CDW and other large data sources.  XXXX has a unique combination of T-sql, SQL server and SAS programming expertise.  She can balance the demands between the large datasets and analytic needs exceptionally well.  XXXX is well versed in intricacies of various VA data sources and provides essential guidance on variable usage and choices.
Data includes sensitive material. XXXX already has the following access in addition to standard VA access:

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:
See paragraph #5

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  
In accordance with FAR 13.106, a comparison of prices proposed under VA241-P-2207 will be used to determining reasonableness. New price for duration of 5 year contract is X/hour; previous pricing was X/hr.

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  
The new work is a follow-on to contract VA241-P-2207.

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  
The experience, and knowledge of the existing data and current datasets along with skills in both SAS, SQL and research are not easily replaceable. These skills and required approvals for data access for the research and understanding and experience of the research data are absolute requirements.

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  
A posting will be made to FBO.

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI)
Service Orientated Architecture Research and Development (SOARD)
Program and Project Management Support Services (PPMSS) for 
Asset Management Enterprise-Wide Deployment

The Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to request responses from qualified small businesses, including but not limited to: Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB), 8(a), HUBZone, etc., capable of providing the requirements below. The responses to this RFI will contribute to determining the method of procurement and identify parties having an interest in, capabilities, past performance, and the resources to support this requirement.

BACKGROUND

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is the second largest Federal agency in the United States (US) and delivers health care, benefits, and services to the nation's Veterans.  As one of three administrations within VA, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is the largest US integrated health care system consisting of 153 hospitals, nearly 1,400 community-based outpatient clinics, community living centers, Vet Centers and Domiciliary rehabilitation centers.   VHA spends over eight billion dollars annually in purchases for supplies, inventory, and equipment and utilizes several legacy systems to manage and/or track its assets, e.g., infrastructure, capital, equipment, and medical supplies.  

VHA has selected IBM's MAXIMO Enterprise Asset Management Software v.7.5 to replace these legacy systems with a VHA owned Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS), web-enabled, integrated system.  This VHA-specific enterprise-asset management program is entitled Service Oriented Architecture Research and Development (SOARD).  

VHA appointed the Special Projects Team (SPT) to manage and provide executive direction for the SOARD Program, which is based in VA's Central Office (headquarters) located in Washington, DC.  SPT intends to continue the deployment of the MAXIMO solution using an agile time boxed methodology (e.g., 90- to 120-day software capability increments referred to as Sprints (projects) under a separate contract).  During the next three years, SPT in collaboration with the VA MAXIMO deployment Contractor, and VHA end-users and stakeholders, will implement MAXIMO  enterprise-wide asset management capability to multiple organizations within VHA at the medical center, Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN) (regional), and administration (enterprise) levels.  The estimated number of end-users is 30,000 with an estimated 7,500 concurrent users.  

DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT

This acquisition will provide SPT with program and project management support services for life-cycle management of the MAXIMO solution enterprise-wide deployment. Program and project management services will ensure VHA's successful rollout to improve VA's current asset management capabilities at the end-user level(s).  

The MAXIMO Sprints require a number of simultaneous project activities to be carefully planned for and executed in quick succession to rapidly scale for enterprise-wide deployment.  These activities must be managed and executed in a dynamic environment, since delivered capability(ies) frequently change in an agile environment to incorporate user feedback and lessons learned from the implementation of Sprints which can change project conditions and the rollout of future Sprints.  The VA functional communities for this MAXIMO solution are as follows:
	
a) Healthcare Technology Management (HTM)
b) Procurement and Logistics - Prosthetics and General Medical Supplies (commonly referred to in industry as Health Care Management (HCS)
c) Environmental Management Services (EMS)
d) Facility Management (FM)
e) Emergency Occupational Safety Health Administration

 
The general deployment process consists of several interrelated activities with possible transitions between them, e.g., deployment of initial Sprints.  These activities may occur at the MAXIMO side or at the end-user side or both.  Accordingly, these Program and Project Management Support Services are dynamic and utilize an integrated approach to VA's deployment for asset, service, and facilities management, which will enable VHA organizations to closely track, monitor, and manage their assets.

 
VA SOARD Deployment Methodology

Note:  Each VISN encompasses 5-12 VA local sites.  Sprints 9 and 10 represent a 400 percent increase in 'VA sites Deployed to' compared with Sprint 8.  Sprints 11 and 12 represent a 175 percent increase compared to Sprints 9 and 10, while Sprints 13 and 14 represent a 140+ percent increase from Sprints 11 and 12.

<DESC>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the procurement of products or services.  This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (now operating as the U.S. AbilityOne Commission) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on  the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) the Committee has been asked to  conduct an impact analysis toward the potential addition of the following product(s) to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		6850-01-285-8354<br />Name:		Cleaner, Marker Board, 8 oz<br />Description:	8 ounce marker board cleaner in pump spray bottle that cleans and reduces shadowing on all whiteboards, erasable marker boards, melamine and porcelain steel boards. Not intended for chalkboard surfaces. UOI is BT.</p>
<p>NSN:		6850-00-NIB-2160<br />Name:		Cleaner, Marker Board, 22 oz<br />Description:	22 ounce marker board cleaner in pump spray bottle that cleans and reduces shadowing on all whiteboards, erasable marker boards, melamine and porcelain steel boards. Not intended for chalkboard surfaces. UOI is BT.</p>
<p>Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be  authorized by the Committee to order the products on behalf of the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne Program&reg; will be the Defense Logistics Agency, Aviation Supply Chain, Richmond, VA.<br /> <br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a), would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected firms are dependent on the income.   Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies.

<p>The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Total (A-List), or Broad (B-List) Government Requirement.  That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne&reg; Program.</p>
<p>These products will also be offered through the AbilityOne Distributor Program.  If your firm is currently selling these products to the Federal Government through commercial means, your firm will continue to sell these products through your AbilityOne Distributor status and there would be no impact against your firm.  If your firm is not an AbilityOne Distributor but would like to become a Distributor, please contact the AbilityOne Program for guidance.  At a minimum, your firm must have a GSA Schedule 75 contract with at least 10,000 items on the schedule contract to be eligible.  Firms can become AbilityOne Distributors for limited items such as toner cartridges or janitorial/sanitation items but must contact the AbilityOne Program for more details.</p>
<p>If your firm is selling either the item(s) listed above, or the items that have been determined to be ETS, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period.  If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>
<p>6.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>7.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response.  Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than February 14, 2014 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to<br />(703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.</p>

<RESPDATE>021414
<CONTACT>Stanley A. Knight, Sr., Team Lead/Contracting Officer, Phone 3014026289, Email knights@niaid.nih.gov - Jonathan E. Bryan, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-451-3167, Email bryanje@niaid.nih.gov
<DESC>&nbsp;
<p align="left">&nbsp;<strong>ADVANCED DEVELOPMENT OF MULTIPLEX DIAGNOSTIC PLATFORMS FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASES </strong></p>
<p>
<p>This is a Request for Information (RFI) only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), will take procurement action in this matter. <strong>This is NOT a solicitation for proposals</strong>, applications, proposal abstracts or quotations. <strong>The purpose of this RFI is to obtain knowledge and information </strong>to assess the current state of the science. Further, neither DHHS/NIH/NIAID nor the government will be responsible for any cost incurred in furnishing this information.</p>
<p>NIAID is seeking information from diagnostics product developers interested in supporting the advanced development of integrated clinical sample-to-answer multiplex diagnostic technologies to detect emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases (http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/emerging/Pages/list.aspx) including NIAID Category A-C Priority Pathogens and other common medically-important pathogens directly from a blood sample, without a blood culture step. The primary focus of this RFI is to gather information about the current product development status of the integrated instrument and potential multiplex diagnostic test. Areas of greatest interest include diagnostics with the following features:</p>
<p>- Multiplex diagnostic products designed for use in a primary healthcare setting, which may include one or more of the following: hospital laboratory, Physician's office, health clinics, emergency department, at the bedside, and/or low resource settings;</p>
<p>-&nbsp;The multiplex platform will consist of an instrument and multiplex diagnostic test(s) performed using the instrument. The instrument may be a single operating unit capable of accepting a clinical sample, or be composed of a cartridge and cartridge-operating unit. A cartridge is any small modular unit designed to be inserted into a larger piece of equipment.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;The instrument should have all components and subsystems (blood sample processing, analyte detection, test result determination and reporting, etc.) completely automated and integrated into an operational unit that does not require any manual manipulation steps after the clinical sample has been loaded on the platform. For example, performance of the diagnostic test must not require manual steps to process and analyze the sample after the blood sample has been transferred from the clinical sample collection container (blood collection tube, etc.) into the entry component of the multiplex diagnostic platform. The entry component may be a tube, cartridge, injection port, or other receptacle into which the clinical sample is transferred to initiate the first processing step within the instrument. Examples of excluded manual steps include shaking, mixing, vortexing, heating, freezing, centrifuging, transferring partially processed samples into new containers (tubes, plates), and/or transferring the sample from one instrument to another instrument.</p>
<strong>
<p>Background</p>
</strong>
<p>Research supported and conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), strives to understand, diagnose, treat and ultimately prevent the myriad of infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases that threaten millions of human lives. The NIAID Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) supports extramural</p>
<p>research to control and prevent diseases caused by virtually all infectious agents with the exception of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). This includes basic and applied research to develop and evaluate medical diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines which are funded through a variety of research grants and contracts. The NIAID also has a mission to advance the development of new medical countermeasures (MCM) against biological agents that are most likely to be used in a terror attack on civilian populations.</p>
<strong>
<p>Information requested</p>
</strong>
<p>Organizations are invited to submit a white paper describing their research efforts towards developing an integrated clinical sample-to-answer multiplex diagnostic product to detect <em>Bacillus anthracis</em>, <em>Yersinia pestis</em>, <em>Francisella tularensis </em>and a minimum of two (2) commonly diagnosed prevalent pathogens with similar early symptoms as the three required biothreat pathogens (fever, malaise, flu-like symptoms, etc.). The pathogens must be detected directly from a blood sample, without a blood culture step. The paper can include but is not limited to:</p>
<p>-&nbsp;A description of the integrated instrument, and if appropriate, the cartridge component;</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Stage of product development for the instrument, and if appropriate, the cartridge component;</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Stage of product development for any existing multiplex diagnostic tests capable of detecting <em>Bacillus anthracis</em>, <em>Yersinia pestis</em>, and <em>Francisella tularensis </em>and common prevalent pathogens directly from a blood sample, including the current status of analytical and clinical studies;</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Intended user setting(s);</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Data to support that the integrated sample-to-answer multiplex platform is appropriate for the intended use(s);</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Description of manufacturing capabilities;</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Status of legal rights to the intellectual property or agreements associated with the instrument or diagnostic test</p>
<p>Responses should be limited to 10 pages, not including cover page, cover letter and table of contents. Any proprietary information should be clearly identified as such and will be kept confidential as allowed by relevant federal law. Submitted data and information will not be returned.</p>
<p>RFI response must include: 1) Name and title of the primary point of contact for the response; 2) Name and address of the Institution or Company; 3) Email address and phone number of the primary point of contact. Responses are due by February 14, 2014.</p>
<strong>
<p>Inquiries</p>
</strong>
<p>Inquiries and RFI responses should be directed to the NIAID Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, Office of Acquisitions, POC Jonathan Bryan, at bryanje@niaid.nih.gov. Alternate POC is Stanley A. Knight, Sr., at <a href="mailto:knights@niaid.nih.gov">knights@niaid.nih.gov</a>.</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) - USAID/Bosnia and Herzegovina <br /><br />From: Laura Slaughter, Regional Contracting Officer - USAID/Kosovo<br /><br />Standard Clause: FAR 52.215-3 Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (OCT 1997) <br /><br />(a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. <br /><br />(b) Although "proposal" and "offeror" are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal. <br /><br />(c) This RFI is issued for the purpose of: obtaining input on the concept detailed below and in the attached document.  <br /><br />The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) is seeking comments on the attached concept for the "MEASURE USAID/BiH Monitoring and Evaluation Support Project". The project has two primary objectives.  The first is to provide USAID/BiH with technical and advisory monitoring and evaluation services, including designing and implementing both quantitative and qualitative evaluation studies and assessments, as well as providing monitoring and evaluation technical assistance for USAID/BiH' programs.  These efforts will rebuild the Mission's result-oriented culture, facilitate informed program management, shape the longer term strategic direction of programs and decision-making within the Mission, and enable USAID/BiH to comply with USAID/Forward principles. <br /><br />The second objective is to build the independent, non-partisan public policy analysis capacity in BiH. This mechanism will develop local capacity to conduct high quality independent evaluations and other studies for USAID/BiH and other donors.  By doing so, the local capacity to use tools and to execute the processes of conducting politically independent analysis of public policy initiatives and the challenges facing BiH will be strengthened.
<p><br />USAID invites comments from interested stakeholders to strengthen the concept in anticipation of a Request for Proposal (RFP). USAID may revise the concept based on comments received, but it is not obligated to do so. Please ensure comments are concise and specific to information included within the concept attached to this notice. USAID values concise, issue&#8208;specific responses. Please ensure submitted comments make specific reference to page and section numbers. Please give special consideration to the following:<br /><br />&#61656;	Feasibility of Component 5: "Strengthen local M&amp;E Capacity and develop a &lsquo;center for excellence';  and <br /> <br />&#61656;	Recommendations to strengthen any perceived weaknesses in the concept.  <br /><br />The request for comments will be open from the date of release through February 12, 2014, 10:00 A.M. Eastern Time. Responses should be no more than 3 (three) pages in length. Comments must be submitted electronically to Viktoria Hollosy, USAID/BiH Contracts Specialist, at vhollosy@usaid.gov.</p>
<p>This is not a formal RFP. USAID/BiH will inform potential offerors of the RFP for the MEASURE through a Pre-Solicitation Notice that may be issued in the future. This notice does not constitute an obligation or endorsement by USAID to proceed with the MEASURE. Responses to this request for comments are not binding on the U.S. Government and do not obligate USAID to issue a Solicitation, nor does it commit USAID to pay any cost incurred in the preparation and submission of comments.<br /><br />Thank you for your interest in USAID programs.<br />Sincerely,</p>
<p>Laura Slaughter<br />Regional Contracting Officer</p>

<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>(a) FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:</p>
<p>Subfactor 1 - Enhanced 911 Service. This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a detailed plan for interfacing and complying with State 911 requirements that meets the following criteria:<br />[a] A sound methodology of how the Offeror will comply with State 911 interface requirements for commercial subscriber lines and trunks.<br />[b] A sound methodology of their process for updating Automatic Line Identification 911 database.<br />[c] A description of alternating routes of 911</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

  (c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.
  (d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers.

        (C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.

Offerors shall not submit a tie offer, since this is inconsistent with the purpose of the reverse auction.

The Contracting Officer may, at his/her sole discretion, extend or re-open the reverse auction if the reason for the offeror's inability to enter pricing is determined to be without fault on the part of the offeror and outside the offeror's control.</span></p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms.

The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <br />(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.<br />(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br />(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.</p>
<p>(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <br />(End of clause)</p>

BACKGROUND<br />The National Marine Mammal Laboratory (NMML) of the Alaska Fishery Science Center (AFSC), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) undertakes studies of marine mammal ecology in support of Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) and Endangered Species Act (ESA) requirements to conduct stock assessments and understand environmental and anthropogenic drivers of population abundance.  Both laws mandate that the government enhance the recovery of listed species and maintain them at optimal sustainable populations.  The Alaska Ecosystems Program (AEP) of NMML specifically conducts studies of Steller sea lion (Eumetopias jubatus) and northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus), guided by recommendations in the NMFS Steller Sea Lion Recovery Plan and the Northern Fur Seal Conservation Plan, with ultimate goals of cessation of declines and enhancement of the populations to the point where they can be delisted or declines mitigated.  Within a broad scope of research activities, there is a vital conservation need to better understand the prevalence of diseases within both Steller sea lion and northern fur seal populations in Alaska.  Both species have undergone significant population declines in recent years, and the causes remain a mystery.  The AEP routinely collects and handles biological samples from Steller sea lions and northern fur seals for ongoing studies of disease and contaminants.  <br />II.

SELECTION CRITERIA AND SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS:  Standard Form 330 (SF 330) - The A&E must demonstrate its and each key sub-consultants qualifications with respect to the published evaluation factors for all services.  Evaluation Criteria (1) through (4) are considered most important and equal among themselves; Criterion (5) is slightly less important; and Criteria (6) and (7) are the least important and equal among themselves.
   Specific evaluation factors include:

Criterion 1  Specialized Experience (SF 330 Part 1 Section F):  Offerors will be evaluated on specialized experience and technical competence of the proposed team and/or proposed consultants in provision of the following services:  linear segmentation of Navy and DoD infrastructure; performance of engineering studies, surveys and assessments; and support to infrastructure condition assessment programs.  

Submission Requirements:   The Contractor shall provide a maximum of seven (7) projects showing specialized experience of the proposed team in provision of the services noted above.  Projects submitted for the Offeror shall have been completed within the five (5) years prior to the date of issuance of this Notice.
  All projects provided in the SF 330 must be completed by the office/branch/regional office/individual team member actually proposed to manage and perform work under this contract.  Projects not meeting this requirement will be excluded from evaluation.  To enable verification, firms should include the DUNS number along with each firm name in the SF330 Part I, Section F, item 25 Firms from Section C Involved in this Project, block (1).    Include a contract number or project identification number in block 21.  Include an e-mail address, and phone number for the point of contact in block 23(c).  Include in the project description the contract period of performance, award contract value, current contract value, a summary of the work performed that demonstrates relevance to specialized experience as outlined above.
  If the contractor served as a subcontractor on a project, indicate the value of the work they provided towards the performance of the overall project.  If a project was performed by a joint venture, and all joint venture partners are not on the team proposed for this contract, the offeror/team should specifically address the work performed by the joint venture partner offering/teaming on this contract.  Likewise, if the offeror/team member worked as a subcontractor on a project, the description should clearly describe the work actually performed by the offeror/team member and the roles and responsibilities of each on the project, rather than the work performed on the project as a whole. If the project description does not clearly delineate the work performed by the entity/entities offering/teaming on this contract, the project could be eliminated from consideration.

If the Offeror is a joint venture (JV), relevant project experience should be submitted for the joint venture if shared experience is available; if no shared experience is available, offers shall submit at least one project performed by each member of the joint venture.
  Offerors are still limited to a maximum of seven (7) projects.     

Projects shall be submitted on the SF-330 at Part 1 Section F and shall be completed.  Projects not completed will be excluded from evaluation consideration.  For submittal purposes, a task order on an IDIQ contract is considered a project, as is a stand-alone contract award.  Do not list an IDIQ contract as an example of a completed project.  Instead, list relevant completed task orders or stand-alone contract awards that fit within the definition above.  Examples of project work submitted that do not conform to this requirement will not be evaluated.

Failure to provide requested data, accessible points of contact, or valid phone numbers could result in a firm being considered less qualified.

All information for Criterion 1 should be submitted in Part 1, Section F of the SF330.
  The Government WILL NOT consider information submitted in addition to Part 1, Section F in evaluating Criterion 1.

Criterion 2 - Professional Qualifications and Technical Competence (SF 330 Part 1 Section E and Section G):  Offerors will be evaluated on professional qualifications and competence of the key personnel to be assigned to provide services to accomplish the tasks required under this contract, which must include experience within the five years prior to the date of issuance of this Notice for the services described in Criterion 1.

Submission Requirements:  Provide resumes for all proposed key personnel.  Resumes are limited to one page each and should cite project specific experience and indicate proposed role in this contract.
  Provide professional registration, certification, licensure and/or accreditation in appropriate disciplines.  Indicate participation of key personnel in example projects in the SF 330 Part 1 Section G.

Criterion 3  Past Performance (SF330, Part 1 Section H): Offerors will be evaluated on past performance with Government agencies and private industry in terms of work quality, innovation, compliance with schedules, cost control, overall safety record, and stakeholder/customer satisfaction. Evaluating past performance and experience will include information provided on Past Performance Questionnaires (PPQs) for Criterion 1 projects (see submission requirements below) and may include other information provided by the firm, customer inquiries, Government databases, and other information available to the Government including contacts with points of contact in other criteria.
  Failure to provide requested data, accessible points of contact, or valid phone numbers could result in a firm being considered less qualified.  NOTE:  Past performance information for projects listed under Criterion 1 will be given greater weight.  

Submission Requirements:  IF A COMPLETED CPARS/ACASS EVALUATION IS AVAILABLE FOR A PROJECT UNDER CRITERION 1, IT SHALL BE SUBMITTED WITH THE COMPLETED SF 330 PACKAGE. IF THERE IS NOT A COMPLETED CPARS/ACASS EVALUATION, the Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ) included in this notice is provided for the offeror or its team members to submit to the client for each project the offeror includes under Criterion 1, Specialized Experience. AN OFFEROR SHALL NOT SUBMIT A PPQ WHEN A COMPLETED CPARS/ACASS IS AVAILABLE.
 

IF A CPARS/ACASS EVALUATION IS NOT AVAILABLE, ensure correct phone numbers and email addresses are provided for the client point of contact. Completed PPQs should be submitted with your SF 330. If the offeror is unable to obtain a completed PPQ from a client for a project(s) before the response date set forth in this notice, the offeror should complete and submit with their response the first page of the PPQ (Attachment), which will provide contract and client information for the respective project(s). Offerors should follow-up with clients/references to ensure timely submittal of questionnaires. If the client requests, questionnaires may be submitted directly to the Government's point of contact, Naval Facilities Engineering Command Atlantic, Code ACQ22, Attn: Jennifer Jordan via email at jennifer.jordan@navy.mil, prior to the response date.
 Offerors shall not incorporate by reference into their response PPQs or CPARS previously submitted in response to other A/E services procurements.  However, this does not preclude the Government from utilizing previously submitted PPQ information in the past performance evaluation. 

In addition to CPARS/ACASS and/or PPQs, provide past performance by the Prime and team members on contracts with government agencies and private industry in terms of work quality, innovation, compliance with schedules, cost control, overall safety record, and stakeholder/customer satisfaction.  Briefly discuss cost control procedures and adherence to project schedules.  Discuss long term business relationships with federal, state and private clients.
  List recent awards, commendations and other performance evaluations.

d)	Discuss the location of offices and other key staff members and how this will be advantageous to the Government; and provide a detailed description of the organizational structure and how it will function.  Firms with multiple locations will be considered more favorably given the worldwide coverage of this proposed contract.

This part requires engineering source approval by the design control activity in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified   
source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). The approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or   knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures, as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity.
 The 
qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over the part in the intended application.       

This part must be acquired from a manufacturing source(s) specified on a source control or selected item drawing as defined by the current version of DoD-STD-100. Suitable technical data, Government data rights, or manufacturing 
knowledge are not available to permit acquisition from other sources, nor qualification testing of another part, nor use of a second source part in the  
intended application.  Although, by DoD-STD-100 definition, altered and selected items shall have an adequate technical data package, data review discloses that required data or data rights are not in Government possession and cannot be economically obtained.

<p>(ix) The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999), applies to this acquisition as follows:</p>
<p>52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999)<br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible quoter whose quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.</p>
<p>This is a Best Value Procurement. The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes:</p>
<p>1. Technical Approach and Understanding (Sample Barrier Analysis)<br />2. Corporate Experience<br />3. Past Performance<br />4. Price (non-rated)</p>
<p>The Technical Approach and Understanding (Sample Barrier Analysis) will be accorded more weight than Corporate Experience and Past Performance. Technical Approach and Understanding (Sample Barrier Analysis), Corporate Experience and Past Performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price. As the technical quotes become more equal, price becomes more important in making the award determination. In the event that two or more quotes are determined not to have any substantial technical differences, i.e., are technically equivalent, award may be made to the lower priced quote. It should be noted that award may be made to other than the lowest priced quote if the Government determines that a price premium is warranted due to technical merit. The Government may also award to other than the highest technically rated quotation, if the Government determines that a price premium is not warranted.</p>
<p>(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of a quote, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful quoter within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>(x) Quoters shall include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, with its offer, or indicate that representations and certifications are available on-line in the Reps &amp; Certs section of their System for Award Management (SAM) record available at https://www.sam.gov.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION/STATEMENT OF WORK<br /><br />Synapsis Radar Processor Installation, Maintenance, and Training in Dakar, Senegal<br /><br />1. BACKGROUND<br /><br />As a part of the U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Research and Innovative Technology Administration (RITA), the Volpe Center is a critical resource for innovation in transportation. Our mission is to improve the nation's transportation system by anticipating emerging transportation issues and to serve as a center of excellence for informed decision making.<br /><br />Since 1970, the Volpe Center has provided critical support to the DOT modal administrations and offices, other Federal agencies, state and local governments and organizations, foreign governments and entities, and the private sector. The Volpe Center's eight Technical Centers encompass all of the research, innovation, technology, and program analysis functions performed on behalf of our sponsors. Each Technical Center leverages multi-disciplinary capabilities to address national transportation goals. The expertise of Volpe Center's staff spans a wide range of transportation modes and disciplines-staff include civil, electrical, mechanical aeronautical engineers, physical and social scientists, human factors experts, economists, planners, information technologists, and safety operation specialists to name a few. Managers build project teams drawing across the organization from this broad range of expertise.<br /><br />The Volpe Center's Situational Awareness and Logistics Division supports the U.S. Africa Command Counternarcotics (USAFRICOM CN) Interagency Fusion Program (IFP) with enhancing counternarcotic efforts in Cape Verde, Ghana, Senegal, Tanzania, and The Gambia. <br /><br />In 2011, U.S. Naval Forces Africa and U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) as part of their theater security cooperation efforts deployed coastal surveillance radar systems at strategic locations within the African continent.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide technical assistance for the development of a data center and information investment technology strategy for the State of Amap&aacute;, Brazil, including an in-depth determination of the engineering, design, financing and supporting infrastructure requirements.</p>
<p>The State of Amap&aacute; faces unique development challenges. Located in the northernmost region of Brazil, Amap&aacute; is logistically isolated from the country's major population centers. The Amap&aacute; state government recognizes that modernizing its information and communications technology infrastructure is a particularly important building block for attracting investment and development.</p>
<p>The Departamento de Processamento de Dados do Estado de Amap&aacute; (Data Processing Department of the State of Amap&aacute;, PRODAP) is currently tasked with developing and executing a strategic plan for the state that sets the overall priorities and direction for the state's investments in IT infrastructure. One of the key activities is the creation of a government data center. This data center will host public sector applications, facilitate the management of government networks, provide backup and disaster recovery functions for data and applications maintained by disparate government agencies, and create a secure environment for the provision of services to commercial enterprises.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $572,275 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and portions of a background Definitional Mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901. To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:</p>

<p>Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009. In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number. Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP. Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up.

Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day. Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.

1)  Question:  On the first page of the solicitation, Standard Form 33, Solicitation, Item 9 it calls for "Sealed bid offers in original and 2 copies for furnishing the supplies or services in the Schedule...".  Meanwhile on page 43, Section L-14, Instruction to Offerors, it says:  "The contractor shall provide 1 original proposal to the Contracting Officer."  Is this a sealed bid procurement?  Answer:  This is a negotiated procurement, concerning FAR 15, based on lowest price, technically acceptable.  This is not a sealed bid procurement.  Question:  How many copies of our proposal shall we send to you?  Answer:  One original proposal and one copy.
Question:  On page 43 of the solicitation, under L-14, Instructions to Offerors, it says:  "Proposals shall include......the most current peer review."  Is this in reference to the AICPA peer review program, as listed on page 44 of the solicitation?  Answer:  Yes.  The peer review referenced on page 43 as part of your proposal is the AICPA peer review, as mentioned on page 44 of the solicitation.  They are one in the same.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<DESC>**Due to a delay in distribution of the Classified Appendix A, the response date has been extended. All questions regarding the Classified Appendix A MUST be submitted to: usarmy.apg.cerdec.mbx.i2wd-comint-rfi@mail.mil.**   <br>      <br>   This is a Request for Information (RFI) only. Please see the attached document for full details.     <br>         <br>     The U.S. Army Communications, Electronics, Research, Development and Engineering Command (CERDEC) Intelligence and Information Warfare Directorate (I2WD) is conducting this Request for  Information (RFI) to identify potential providers of a Communications Intelligence (COMINT) collection system for installation aboard a De Havilland DHC-8-300 series aircraft.     <br>          <br>     Purpose:     <br>          <br>     This is a Request for Information (RFI). This is NOT a request for Quotations or Proposals.  No solicitation document exists and a formal solicitation may or may not be issued by the Government as a result of the responses to this RFI.  No contract award or funding of any kind will occur as a result of this RFI.  The Government will not pay for any response expenses.  Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response.  The Government encourages teaming/partnering.  The lack of the submission of data at this time will not eliminate any firm's participation in the future competition of a competitive contract.  The purpose of this RFI is to identify potential providers of a COMINT collection system with a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of at least 7 for installation aboard a De Havilland DHC-8-300 series aircraft.     <br>           <br>     Airborne COMINT System Description:     <br>          <br>     The Army has a critical requirement for a worldwide, self-deployable ISR capability that can immediately begin operations when arriving in theater and sustain long-term operations.  These capabilities: COMINT, Radar, and Imagery Intelligence (IMINT), will provide the warfighter real time support to targeting, suppression of enemy air defenses, signal mapping, and support to small scale contingency (SSC) operations through the exploitation of enemy movers, sitters, and emitters.       <br>          <br>     The COMINT collection system is required to provide direction finding (DF), recognition, copy, and exploitation functions.  The system must function against both conventional and modern signals.  It must also provide data to comply with the requirements specified in the Airborne Overhead Cooperative Operations Communications Intelligence Joint Interface Control Document Version 4.1 (Threshold) Released 1 June, 2010 (Version 4.2 Objective) to participate in Theatre Net-centric Geolocation (TNG).  The COMINT collection system must produce signal identification and target location accuracies sufficient to support target development, target tracking, and multi-sensor cross cue functions.  Multiple mission profiles must be supported.  The COMINT system must be controllable from 4 on-board operators using DCGS-A workstations and/or via remotely located workstations.  The system must provide a seamless interface to Operational Ground Station (OGS), current reporting networks, and to National data bases.  It must be highly reliable, easy to maintain, and have low sustainment cost.       <br>          <br>     All questions related to this RFI must be submitted to to usarmy.apg.cerdec.mbx.i2wd-comint-rfi@mail.mil.    <br>        <br>     All responses must be submitted to usarmy.apg.cerdec.mbx.i2wd-comint-rfi@mail.mil by 4:00 pm ET on February 28, 2014.     <br>          <br>     **Please see the attached document for full details**

<DESC>***** Amendment 01 ******
This amendment is to update the responses due date to February 10, 2014.  No other changes are made to the synopsis. 
****** End of Amendment 01 *************** The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1, with Horiba Instruments, Inc. to provide a Particulate Matter (PM) Measurement System in Vehicle Site 5 located at the National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL), 2565 Plymouth Road, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48105. 
The vehicle site 5 test site is based around an existing test control and data acquisition system (test cell host computer) that represents a significant investment by the government.  There are no plans to replace this system.  This CDTCS 5000 test cell computer system performs many complex functions, among them is communication related to control of, and data acquisition from, an existing ?Horiba Instruments MEXA analytical system.  The test cell host computer utilizes a specialized and unique set of drivers and command structure required by a Horiba-propriety host communication protocol, MEXA-LAN.  Incorporation of a new communication protocol in the existing test control and data acquisition system would be required with any other PM measurement system and would require significant additional investment by the government.  Replacement of the test host computer would complicate test control of the Horiba ?MEXA gaseous analytical and constant volume sampling systems.  Furth er, replacement of the test host computer system in this test site is neither anticipated nor desired, and would jeopardize a critical EPA regulatory mission by extending the implementation date for Part 1066 testing.
With regard to this specific procurement, in order for another vendor to be responsive to the solicitation they would have to provide a PM measurement system that responds to the same, extensive, set of computer commands that the Horiba ?MEXA system responds to.  This set of commands is part of the proprietary Horiba MEXA-LAN network protocol.  This protocol is associated with Horiba proprietary software imbedded in Horiba MEXA system microprocessors.  Use of this imbedded software by another supplier in their products would be infringement upon Horiba intellectual property. In building complete test cell systems that utilize Horiba MEXA equipment, integrators utilize the MEXA-LAN protocol and command set to program their test-cell control and data acquisition computers in order to interact with MEXA exhaust gas analyzers.  The test site that will utilize the analysis system obtained by this procurement is run by an existing test-cell control and data acquisition computer custom programmed by NVFEL staff.  Since the current PM measurement system being procured is also a Horiba product, the existing test site computer already uses the MEXA-LAN command set and communication structure in its own software.
The vehicle testing this procurement supports involves a complex series of actions and events that take place over a specific time frame or ?test cycle.?  The test-cell control and data acquisition computer has the complex task of coordinating the entire test process.  Some examples of this task include:
?	Collecting operator input which configures the test for the engine to be tested ?	Vehicle operation over a prescribed series of speed ?	Issuing commands to various pieces of test equipment, including the exhaust analysis system before during and after testing ?	Monitoring equipment for fault conditions and taking appropriate actions ?	Collecting data from several pieces of equipment and sensors continuously during the test ?	Processing a large data set after the test to calculate, report and transmit results
In addition to engine tests, the test-cell control and data acquisition computer must perform similar functions on a periodic basis to conduct various diagnostic tests required by regulation.  These tests are conducted in order to demonstrate the validity of engine test results.
For some equipment that the vehicle test-cell control and data acquisition computer interacts with, the command and/or data acquisition function is quite simple.  This is not the case for the exhaust PM measurement system since there are many different actions the analysis system performs in response to commands from the test-cell control and data acquisition computer, and many different data variables that the measurement system communicates back to the test-cell computer.  These tasks utilize serial communication throughout the test, to issue function commands, pass information and data back and forth and to monitor the analysis system for proper functioning.  As a result, a specific communication structure for commands and variable names, in this case MEXA-LAN, is utilized throughout the custom software of the test-site computer system.  There are no plans to replace this test-cell control and data acquisition computer and changing this software would entail considerable c ost to the government in the form of labor to rewrite debug and completely validate new software at the test site. This would also result in concurrent loss of test function during the implementation process, impacting critical test schedule functions. This procurement will be accomplished using FAR Part 12 and 13 Procedures.  Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS. A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Sources wishing to be considered MUST submit documentation to the office identified above.  Documentation must be submitted within 15 calendar days of the date of publication of this notice.  Submit your documentation in writing to Greta Perry by e-mail to perry.greta@epa.gov.  Telephone requests will not be honored.

Questions must be submitted by using the 'Submit a Question' feature at www.fedbid.com. Questions not received within a reasonable time prior to close of the solicitation may not be considered.*** <BR> <BR>For this solicitation, VHA NCO 08 - 546 - Miami, FL intends to conduct an online competitive reverse auction to be facilitated by the third-party reverse auction provider, FedBid, Inc. FedBid has developed an online, anonymous, browser based application to conduct the reverse auction. A Seller may submit a series of pricing bids, which descend in price during the specified period of time for the aforementioned reverse auction. VHA NCO 08 - 546 - Miami, FL is taking this action in an effort to improve both seller access and awareness of requests and the agency's ability to gather multiple, completed, real-time bids.All responsible Sellers that respond to this solicitation MUST submit the pricing portion of their bid using the online exchange located at www.FedBid.com. There is no cost to register, review procurement data or make a bid on www.FedBid.com.Sellers that are not currently registered to use www.FedBid.com should proceed to www.FedBid.com to complete their free registration. Sellers that require special considerations or assistance may contact the FedBid Helpdesk at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or via email at clientservices@fedbid.com. Sellers may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means. It is unacceptable to place bad faith bids, to use decoys in the www.FedBid.com process or to collude with the intent or effect of hampering the competitive www.FedBid.com process.Should Sellers require additional clarification, contact FedBid at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or clientservices@fedbid.com. <BR> <BR>Use of FedBid:   Buyers and Sellers agree to conduct this transaction through FedBid in compliance with the FedBid Terms of Use. Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>In addition to any VHA buy terms entered in FedBid, the Seller (Bidder) has reviewed and acknowledges any attached solicitation documents, item details, delivery schedule, and/or instructions to Seller (collectively referred to as requirements), and agrees to all terms and conditions set forth in the solicitation documents. While additional support documentation (e.g. Seller Attachments) may be requested, pricing shall be entered as a 'bid' in the reverse auction - offline pricing is not an acceptable bid. At the conclusion of the reverse auction, if attached to the buy, the apparent winning bidder shall be required to complete the solicitation documents prior to award. <BR> <BR>New Equipment ONLY; NO remanufactured or "gray market" items. All items must be covered by the manufacturer's warranty. <BR> <BR>Bid MUST be good for 30 calendar days after close of Buy. <BR> <BR>Shipping must be free on board (FOB) destination CONUS (Continental U.S.), which means that the seller must deliver the goods on its conveyance at the destination specified by the buyer, and the seller is responsible for the cost of shipping and risk of loss prior to actual delivery at the specified destination. <BR> <BR>Offeror must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before an award can be made to them.  If the offeror is not registered in the CCR, it may do so through the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov. <BR> <BR>No partial shipments are permitted unless specifically authorized at the time of award. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>The goal of the Vanishing Programmable Resources (VAPR) BAA is to develop and establish a basis set of materials, components, integration, and manufacturing capabilities to undergird this new class of electronics.IBM plans is to utilize the property of strained glass substrates to shatter as the driving force to reduce attached CMOS chips into Si and SiO2 powder. A trigger, such as a fuse or a reactive metal layer will be used to initiate shattering, in at least one location, on the glass substrate. An external RF signal will be required for this process to be initiated. IBM will explore various schemes to enhance glass shattering and techniques to transfer this into the attached Si CMOS devices.

<DESC>The goal of the Vanishing Programmable Resources (VAPR) BAA is to develop and establish a basis set of materials, components, integration, and manufacturing capabilities to undergird this new class of electronics. PARC will integrate their experience with stress-engineered materials, silicon processing, and microchip handling and deposition to create a transience technology<br />called Disintegration Upon Stress-release Trigger, or DUST. PARC proposes to develop stress-engineered substrates with integrated triggers and silicon proxy, or "dummy" circuits that, upon application of a short electrical trigger, will crumble into small, sand-like particles in a fraction of a second. The particle size is such that the individual pieces will be invisible to the naked eye at a reasonable distance and will blend into the<br />surrounding environment under a variety of CONOPS. The transience behavior is enabled as the intense internal stress of the substrate is released, and is the core element of this technology.

<DESC>The scope of this project is to remove the existing pilings, seven (7) each, and replace with seven (7) new, marine pressure treated pilings that are 12-14 inches in diameter and forty-five feet in length, capped with a white heavy duty polyethylene cap.  The existing pilings will need to be removed from site and properly disposed of.  Each new piling is to be driven fifteen feet into the existing  quote mark ground line quote mark  of the river bottom slope.  The project also includes the installation of two (2) new pile holders, one identical in size to the existing pile holders, and firmly affixed to the side of the floating dock identical to the manner all other typical pile holders are affixed to the floating dock. The second pile holder, located at the east end of the dock, is affixed differently than the typical pile holders.  This pile holder has broken off and will need to be replaced.  It is the contractor's responsibility to come up with the best solution for the fix.  A contractor site visit can be coordinated through USACE to evaluate the existing dock.  In addition, this project includes the replacement of one (1) new board, marine pressure treated 10 quote mark  x 12 quote mark  x 3 quote mark  pine board at the east end of the floating dock.  This also includes mobilization and demobilization of all the necessary equipment to complete the project.  This equipment should include everything necessary to remove and install timber pilings in a marine environment.  For example, a crane barge, crane, and pile hammer.  Water jetting is not permitted as a pile installation method.
