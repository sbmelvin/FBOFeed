<DESC>Introduction:  Pursuant to FAR Subpart 13.106-1(b)(1), the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division, on behalf of the Product Manager Force Sustainment Systems Directorate (PM FSS), intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order on a sole source basis to: National Instruments Corporation, Austin, TX 78759.<BR><BR>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  <BR><BR>NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT IS AVAILABLE. <BR> <BR>1. Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs: <BR><BR>Purchase Wireless Data Acquisition (WDA) hardware and software devices from a single source. The WDA devices are required to collect temperature, pressure and liquid flow data for evaluation and optimization of Product Manager Force Sustainment Systems (PM FSS) equipment which will be setup at the Force Provider (FP) base camp training area at Ft. Devens, MA. Wireless data acquisition is the most efficient process to capture the required data due to amount of Equipment Under Test (EUT) and the far proximity of the EUT throughout the training area. The required Temperature, Pressure, and liquid Flow readings will be acquired by the WDA equipment and stored on a computer, accessible remotely by PM FSS engineers for analysis.<BR><BR>2. A demonstration that the proposed contractor is the only source available to provide these services or goods (i.e. unique qualifications, proprietary rights, etc.): <BR><BR>Based on the application for frequency allocation (DD1494) to the Army Spectrum Management Office (ASMO), PM FSS is required to purchase brand name equipment due to cost and mission sensitive time considerations in reapplication necessary for other vendors. National Instruments offers a solution to wireless data acquisition of Temperature, Pressure and Flow data. The National Instruments Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) creates a network independent using the network of sensors and controllers placed in an area near each other. Also, the LabVIEW Software allows the data to be collected and interpreted using programs we already use, i.e. Microsoft Excel. In addition, LabVIEW software also allows the user (PM FSS) to broadcast the information via the internet. This is the most convenient and accessible method due to the fact it would cut down trips for PM FSS to travel from Natick, MA to Fort Devens. <BR>	<BR>3. A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted:<BR><BR>Market research was performed using the Internet with Wireless Data Acquisition as the keyword. Search results displayed National Instruments a<BR>the main provider for such equipment. Reviewing their products, and the products of their competitors, conclusion was reached that National Instruments, offered the only WDA products that met PM FSS' requirements.<BR><BR>4. Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition:<BR><BR>None<BR><BR>5. A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required: <BR><BR>Based on response to this posting, any responding alternate vendors will be considered for future solicitations.<BR><BR>6. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement to the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division via e-mail to: steve.streeter@us.army.mil no later than 5:00 PM (EST) on February 16, 2011.<BR><BR><BR>Contracting Office Address: <BR>RDECOM Contracting Center - Natick<BR>CCRD-NA-SU, Natick Contracting Division<BR>Kansas Street, Building 1<BR>Natick, MA 01760-5011<BR><BR>Point of Contact:<BR>Steven Streeter, Contract Specialist (508) 233-6180<BR>steve.streeter@us.army.mil<BR><BR>
