This request for information is UNCLASSIFIED and in support of market research.  The responses may aid in the development of an eventual Request for Proposal to provide a standardized DCGS Analysis Reporting Team (DART) baseline workstation to the AF DCGS enterprise.  If this market research leads to a Request for Proposal, it will be offered to Network Centric Solution (NETCENTS) contractors.  Information regarding NETCENTS can be found at http://public.gunter.af.mil/aq/netcents/1/ and www.afway.af.mil.  The information you provide is for information and planning purposes only.
This RFI seeks the 2 "best of breed" tools (TRL-7 or higher) which each contractor believes can add value to the DART mission.  Any tools submitted must be able to operate in a windows virtualization environment.  It is the contractor's burden to adequately demonstrate successful operation in a virtualization environment and justify each tool's standing as a TRL-7.  Industry product developers are requested to provide ESC/HSJB with technical White Papers.  The contents should include information about the company, proposed DART analyst tools, the technology's relevance to the AF DCGS DART cell, and its successes, if any.

The contractor shall test the system, including, but not necessarily limited to, all pipes, sprinkler heads, fittings, couplings, etc. for leaks or discrepancies as per the fire systems engineer's system test requirements. The contractor shall correct and repair any leaks or discrepancies found.<br><br>In accordance with FAR 36.204 "Disclosure on the magnitude on construction projects", the estimated price range is between $4,000.00 and $8,000.00.<br><br>This is a pre-solicitation.

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Pacific Northwest Regional Office, intends to negotiate one sole-source contract for Stream gauging Services at the following locations within the state of Oregon:  Malheur River Basin near Drewsey, NF Malheur River above Beulah Reservoir, Burnt River near Hedford, Powder River near Sumpter, Powder River at Baker City, Powder River below Thief Valley Reservoir, Powder River above Thief Valley Reservoir near North Powder, Crooked River near Prineville, Crooked river above Prineville Reservoir near post, Mill Creek near Prineville, Ochoco Creek above Reservoir near Prineville, Ochoco Creek below Ochoco Reservoir, and Prineville Reservoir near Prineville.  One contract will be negotiated with the Oregon Water Resources Department (OWRD).  The NAICS code for this requirement is 924110, Administration of Air and Water Resource and solid Waste Management Programs and the small business size standard is not applicable as Reclamation has determined, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, that only the OWRD possesses the unique qualifications for these services for Bureau of Reclamation lands in Oregon.  OWRD owns the high-dollar, high-tech gauging stations and the equipment at the stations.  They will not allow anyone other than their extensively trained personnel to access their stations or equipment. The unique source determination is based on the following: (1) Reclamation's mission includes management of water resources for irrigation and power generation; (2) Reclamation requires continuous record streamflow data for the subject river basins to support mission accomplishment; (3) OWRD has in-place stream gauging recorder stations capable of providing the required data; (4) this action continues an established cost sharing arrangement between OWRD and Reclamation to acquire critical data required for effective administration of both OWRD and Reclamation programs; (5) alternatively, the U.S. Geological Survey could provide the required services, but at a significant increase in cost.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals to Julie Mathews via email at jmathews@usbr.gov or fax 208/378-5108. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within 15 days after date of publication of this announcement will be considered by Reclamation. A determination by Reclamation not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of Reclamation. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

The anticipated value of the BPA is $150,000.00 for the 3 years. The work to be performed under this specification includes non-personnel services. Contractor shall provide all labor, tools, materials, transportation, and facilities necessary to furnish the supplies called for by the Contracting Officer or authorized representatives for fuel, oil, diesel, and lubricants. For this acquisition, North American Industrial Classification System code is 424710 and the Small Business Size Standard is 100 employees. This acquisition is a Small Business Set Aside.

This information will be reviewed by the Government Technical Representative for consideration for future requirements.
Effective October 1, 1997, contractors are required to register their firms in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to receiving a contract award. This database provides basic business information, capabilities, and financial information to the Government and complies with the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, which requires federal agencies to have the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) of every contractor and to pay every contractor through electronic funds transfer. Registration can be accomplished through the World Wide Web at http//www.ccr.gov. Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award. The CCR Handbook and information on the registration process can be obtained via the CCR website, http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423. 
Offerors will be required to complete the annual representation and certification electronically via the Online Representation and Certification Application (ORCA) website at http://orca.bnp.gov.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Office of Mine Safety and Health Research (OMSHR) have intent to issue a purchase order to Mechdyne Corporation for a computer cluster, Virtual Reality Image generators.<br /><br />The computer cluster is needed to develop and test software simulations for the MRET (Mine Rescue and Escape Training) Lab virtual reality display systems prior to implementation on the full theater space. This cluster will allow project staff to debug simulations without using the projection displays which will save time and maintenance costs for these systems. It will also allow staff to test simulations while the MRET virtual reality simulators are in use by other groups. The computer cluster needs to match a similar cluster to be delivered by Mechdyne as a sub-contractor for the MRET Lab. The cluster will serve as a prototyping station for virtual training software testing prior to implementation on the main cluster and displays.

<a href="mailto:elizabeth.terhune@va.gov">Elizabeth Terhune, Contracting Specialist</a>
<DESC>The intent of this notice is to inform the contracting community that the Government intends to enter into a sole source contract for services to "Modify MICU Nurse Call" at the Richard L Roudebush VA Medical Center with South Western Communications (SWC), 4871 Rosebud lane, Newburgh IN 47630 to install a new Rauland Nurse Call System as described herein:  The Richard L Roudebush VA Medical Centers located in Indianapolis has the following requirement; to modify the nurse call system for MICU area under renovation.  
	The Medical Center recently activated the new 7th and 8th floors, including a new Rauland Nurse Call System.  The medical center's goal is to have the same standard of care throughout the entire facility, and as a result, the nurse call system was upgraded facility-wide to be capable of integrating with the new areas.  The Rauland system that was installed on the 7th and 8th floors and throughout the facility needs to be expanded to include the new private rooms that are being added in MICU to create a fully integrated nurse communication system, while increasing patient safety and satisfaction.  The purpose of an integrated facility-wide nurse call system is that if a nurse or other staff travels outside of their care area and a call is initiated, that care giver will still receive the call and can respond accordingly.  If the nurse call system is not compatible in all areas, care givers outside their areas could miss patient calls, which could endanger patient safety.  SWC, who installed the system on the 7th and 8th floors and throughout the rest of the medical center, is the only local authorized distributor and installer of the Rauland Nurse Call System.  
The installation of the Rauland Nurse Call System was a full and open competition procurement for the activation of the 7th and 8th floors of this facility.  SWC was the contractor awarded that contract, they are the only local licensed installer and distributer of the Rauland system.  During that procurement cycle three contractors submitted proposals and were evaluated.  The Rauland system was selected.  The FY10 facility-wide ARRA nurse call installation project was also bid out and was awarded to SWC because the competing companies were not able to provide an integrated solution to insure full interoperability and none are licensed to install the Rauland System.
The Rauland Nurse Call System is the only system that will allow for full interoperability with all components of the existing nurse call, including the pocket pagers, wireless phones, tracer tags, and patient locator.  Introducing another manufacturer's phone or resource location system would cause frequency interference with the currently installed systems.  The current nurse call system has been approved to interface with our VA LAN.  Other systems have not been approved and are not guaranteed that they could be connected to the VA LAN.  
As a result, the government intends to award a contract to South Western Communications (SWC) for these services on a sole source basis. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition for this procurement is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. In accordance with FAR 6.302-1(b)(1), agencies are permitted to utilize this authority contingent upon a reasonable basis existing that the agency's minimum needs can only be satisfied by unique supplies or services available from only one source or only one supplier with unique capabilities.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation issued; a separate written solicitation will NOT be issued via Federal Business Opportunities. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government shall consider all proposals and information received by 4:00 PM EST, May 24, 2011. Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether a competitive procurement is a viable option.  No solicitation document exists and no telephone inquiries shall be accepted. Information can be sent to the Department of Veterans Affairs, R.L. Roudebush VAMC, 1481 W. 10th Street, Indianapolis, IN 46202. Attn: Elizabeth Terhune (90CSC).

<DESC><strong>Contracting Office Address<br /></strong>Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 6120 Executive Boulevard, EPS Suite 600, Room 6068, Rockville, MD 20852, UNITED STATES.<br /><strong>Description<br /></strong>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Cell Production Laboratory plans to procure on a sole source basis with Gatan Inc. 780 Commonwealth Drive, Warrendale, PA 15086 for preventative maintenance for Modern Electron Microscopes manufactured by FEI with a CCD camera as part of the Gatan Imaging Filter (GIF) (s/n 01102601, 01102301, and 04093001).<br />This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1).<br /><br />Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.<br /><br />The North American Industry Classification System code is 811219 and the business size standard is $19M. <br /><br />Period of performance is July 1, 2011 to June 31, 2012.<br /><br />Modern Electron Microscopes such as the three Tecnai series microscopes manufactured by FEI company installed in our lab are highly complex instruments requiring continuous servicing by qualified engineers. The instrumentation encompasses high vacuum components, electromagnetic lenses, CCD cameras, pneumatic systems all highly integrated into computer controlled access to the various microscope functions.<br /><br />Each of the three microscopes has its own CCD Camera with the Polara microscope having an additional CCD camera as part of the Gatan Imaging Filter (GIF). Because of the special nature of the CCD technology these cameras and the GIF are independently serviced by Gatan Inc. engineers. The cameras and the GIF need to be periodically aligned in the FEI electron microscopes and recalibrated with respect to their sensitivity to the electron dose.<br />There is a complex level of digital access to the FEI microscope and its CCD Cameras and GIF permitted only to the qualified FEI and Gatan service engineers.<br /><br />Only Gatan certified service engineers who are employees of the company and are trained in all aspects of service to the electron microscope CCD cameras and GIF and are authorized to service these instruments. The warranty on the microscope and the CCD cameras and the GIF is only guaranteed if the microscopes are serviced by FEI and Gatan Engineers. Therefore no company other than Gatan can provide the service for the Gatan CCD cameras and the GIF.<br /><br />The Gatan Service Engineers are officially on call during the regular work week but they will also answer emergency calls so as not to disrupt any ongoing use of the microscope. In addition they make two preventative maintenance calls during the duration of the contract<br /><br />It is therefore imperative that each of the four (4) CCD cameras and the GIF have an annual service contract.<br /><br />The proprietary software controlling the electron microscope CCD Cameras and the GIF is constantly being upgraded and this can only be done by qualified Gatan service engineers.<br /><br />This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein. An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI Office of Acquisitions on or before 11:00 AM EST on June 3, 2011. No electronic capability statements will be accepted (i.e. email or fax), an original and one copy must be sent to the NCI Office of Acquisitions at the address stated above. All questions must be in writing and can be faxed (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Erin Breedlove, Contract Specialist at breeerin@nih.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration and certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov. No collect calls will be accepted. Please reference solicitation number NCI-110071-EB on all correspondence.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The authorized Federal Navigation Project for the lower Kennebec River consists of a channel, 27 feet deep and 500 feet wide extending from the river mouth near Popham Beach to a point about 13 miles upstream at the city of Bath.<br><br>The New England District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is proposing to perform maintenance dredging of two portions (and advance maintenance dredging in one of those two portions) of the Federal project in the Kennebec River in the summer of 2011.  Dredging is needed to remove dangerous shoals from the channel in advance of the transit of the U.S. Navy Destroyer, the "SPRUANCE", currently scheduled to depart the Bath Iron Works (BIW) on or about September 1, 2011 on its way to being commissioned.  The SPRUANCE has been deemed critical to national defense and its transit from the BIW cannot be delayed.  We are proposing to perform maintenance dredging in the vicinity of Doubling Point (just below Bath) and at the mouth of the river near Popham Beach. We estimate that a total of about 70,000 cubic yards (i.e. 60,000 cubic yards from Doubling Point and 10,000 cubic yards from Popham Beach) of clean sandy material needs to be removed from the channel.  The shoals in the Doubling Point area consist of massive sand-waves oscillating within vertical and horizontal ranges; the elevation at the tips of these sand-waves vary from -19.7' to  -26.8'.  As part of this proposal, advance maintenance may be performed to remove the sand-waves in the vicinity of Doubling Point to a maximum elevation of -32' in an effort to improve the chance that adequate depths will endure.  The estimated quantity mentioned above (i.e. 60,000 cubic yards) includes advance maintenance dredging.  The proposed work will be performed with a hopper dredge over a three to five week period beginning on or about August 1, 2011.  The material dredged from the Doubling Point area will be disposed of at the previously used in-river disposal site located north of Bluff Head in about 95 to 100 feet of water.  Material dredged from the Popham Beach area will be disposed at a previously used 500-yard circular near-shore disposal site located about 0.4 nautical miles south of Jackknife Ledge in depths of about 40 to 50 feet.  Maintenance dredging is contingent upon the availability of the necessary approvals and funding.  <br><br>We anticipate that plans and specifications will be available around mid to late May 2011 and will be available for downloading by accessing the Federal Business Opportunities website (http:/www.fbo.gov).  In order to view this solicitation, prospective contractors are required to self register their firm with Federal Business Opportunities (go to http:/fbo.gov and register under Vendor/Citizen).  Amendments, if any, to his solicitation will be made available at the http:/www.fbo.gov website.  Neither telephonic, mailed nor faxed requests will be accepted.  Registrants are responsible for the accuracy of the information on the FedBizOps Registration List.<br><br>This is being issued as an unrestricted procurement.  The estimated cost of the contract is between $1,000,000 to $1,500,000.  The applicable NAICS code is 237990.  Any responsible source meeting this standard may submit a proposal to be considered by the New England District.   <br>

<DESC>The US Army Research Acquisition Activity intends to issue a sole source purchase order to McKesson Health Solutions,  335 Interlocken Pkwy, Broomfield, CO 80021-3484 to provide for an enterprise-wide license for a web-based inpatient clinical decision tool for inpatient and alternative care settings and shall include technical support, and training in support of medical management activities for the Direct Care System (DCS) and remote areas. The selected support tool will be distributed to Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and other organizations within the TRICARE Management Activity (TMA). The Military Health System (MHS) has approximately 5.026 million TRICARE Prime beneficiaries, 63 Military Hospitals, 413 Medical Clinics.<br><br>Inpatient clinical decision support tools are evidenced-based criteria used in managing the quality and efficiency of health care services (e.g., prospective, concurrent, and retrospective utilization management reviews).  These tools are inherently cost-avoidance products that can prevent over-utilization, facilitate appropriate specialty referrals and inpatient hospitalizations, and support other medical management activities.<br><br>The Inpatient Clinical Decision Support Tool shall assist in the inpatient clinical decision-making and utilization analysis for the inpatient and alternate care settings.  The tool shall include sets of measurable, objective clinical indicators reflecting the need for hospitalization and for diagnostic and therapeutic services in the medical/surgical and behavioral health arenas.<br><br>No solicitation documents exist.  Any firm that believes it can provide the stated capability is invited to submit a written notification to the Contracting Officer with in five (7) calendar days from the date of publication of this notice.  Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the firm's ability to provide the stated capability.  Information can be sent to the Contracting Officer at:  USAMRAA, ATTN:  MCMR-AAA-P (James Cheng), 820 Chandler Street, Frederick, MD  21702-5014.  Please contact through email James.Cheng@amedd.army.mil. No telephone or facsimile requests will be accepted.  Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no responses are received, USAMRAA will proceed with the sole source contract.<br><br>**Sole Source Justification<br><br>1.	Authority Cited. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is   10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(2) as implemented by FAR 6.302-2(a)(2) - When the agency's need for the supplies or services is of such an unusual and compelling urgency that the Government would be seriously injured unless the agency is permitted to limit the number of sources from which it solicits bids or proposals, full and open competition need not be provided for.<br>2.	Reason for Authority Cited. A 3 month contract award is sought to prevent disruption to the quality of care provided at the military treatment facilities as a result of no access to the clinical inpatient decision support tool. Any interruption in support could result in an increase risk to patient safety and negative impact on Services to Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and other organizations within the TRICARE Management Activity (TMA), to include the Military Health System (MHS) which has approximately 5.026 million TRICARE Prime beneficiaries, 63 Military Hospitals and 413 Medical Clinics. <br>3.	Efforts to Obtain Competition. Due to the Nature of the services required and time constraints no effort will be made to solicit from multiple vendors. However, a re-compete is being planned and is projected to be in place by Summer 2011. Market research indicates that there are at least two vendors that have the capacity to provide the services required by the PWS.<br>4.	Actions to Increase Competition. This action is to substantially increase the level of effort to contract W81XWH-08-P-0596. No action will be taken to increase competition for this action due to the urgency of the requirement. A follow-on Task Order will be competitively awarded via Federal Supply Schedule, which is projected to occur on or about August 2011.<br>

<p><br />This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis. It is intended as a method of informing potential contractors of the existence of a Bid Qualification Plan for a two year repair and parts service in support of the Air Force Andros F6-A, Air Force Variant HD-1 and HD-2 Robotic Set, and Power Hawk. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the government. The USAF is seeking potential contractors to become an approved source for repair and parts service for the Air Force Andros F6-A, Air Force Variant HD-1 and HD-2 Robotic Set, and Power Hawk, and gain knowledge of the interests, capabilities, and qualifications of vendors who can successfully support these requirements. The Government is in need of information on potential sources that can perform repairs and refurbishments of Government-owned equipment from commercial Andros F6-A, HD-1 and HD-2 Robotic Set, and Power Hawk that are used to remotely eliminate IED and UXO threats. The Bid Qualification Plan outlines those efforts necessary to approve potential contractors to bid as a source for repair and parts replacements. The Bid Qualification Plan is designed to demonstrate each offeror's competency to inspect, evaluate, clean, repair, test, troubleshoot, and provide parts for the robot set and return to Government inventory in serviceable condition (meet or exceeds manufacturer specification) under the direction of the program office. The contractor shall provide repair and/or parts status on a monthly or quarterly basis with limited warranty up to 1 year and provide reporting through the USAF Deficiency Reporting, Investigation and resolution process (ref. IAW T.O. 00-35D-54) for the repaired and/or parts. The Government does not own or have access to the technical data package for the repair and/or overhaul of the robot set. Interested/qualified sources must include help desk technical support in the unit repair cost. The Government is investigating the feasibility of establishing organic repair capability and is requesting interested sources to determine willingness of entering into a teaming agreement to establish a potential depot repair capability. <br /><br />A Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract for repair and replacement service for the Air Force Andros F6-A, Air Force Variant HD-1 and HD-2 Robotic Set, and Power Hawk is being contemplated.</p>
<p>The anticipated requirement for repair and replacement is for around 200 units for the F6-A, 150 for the HD-1/HD-2, and 200 for the Power Hawk. Please note these numbers are estimates and in no way obligate the US Government. The Government has not formalized an acquisition strategy. There is no solicitation and there is no other information available at this time. Only responses to this sources sought will be accepted. Questions regarding the scope of work or acquisition strategy will not be accepted.</p>

<DESC>Statement of Work <br />Economic Impact Analysis on Proposed Regulations for Living Conditions for Organic Poultry<br />Agricultural Marketing Service<br />U.S. Department of Agriculture
<p>1. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The USDA National Organic Program (NOP) regulations at 7 CFR Part 205 sets forth the national standards for production and handling of organic agricultural products. The NOP requires an economic analysis related to organic poultry production for the development of rule making, policies, guidance and statutory amendments. The NOP regulations were first published in 2000 and were updated in February 2010 to include a substantial practice standard amendment regarding access to pasture for livestock. The following sections regulate livestock living conditions as they apply to poultry: &sect; 205.238 (Livestock health care practice standard), &sect; 205.239 (Livestock living conditions).</p>
<p>The NOP regulations do not set specific stocking rates for either inside housing or the outside access areas, and it is clear that further elaboration is needed to ensure consistent regulatory implementation and enforcement. The NOP issued a general policy memo in October 2002 that affirmed that outside access areas are required, but it did not specify size or other details. The NOP subsequently provided a memo regarding exemption to outside access for purposed of biosecurity, as well as a decision that outside access could be provided in a fenced, roofed, and floored outside area (a "porch" attached to a poultry house). To obtain organic certification, poultry producers must submit an Organic System Plan (OSP) describing outside access to NOP. The OSP is subsequently reviewed by USDA-accredited certification agents, who then interpret the regulations, review the OSP for sufficiency, and conduct on-site inspections to verify compliance by organic operations. The National Organic Standards Board (NOSB), the NOP's citizen advisory panel, made recommendations in April 2002, November 2009. The NOSB also proposed further changes in April 2011 concerning appropriate living conditions for poultry. The NOP intends to publish a regulatory amendment to 205.239 in accordance with NOSB final recommendations that will clarify requirements for outside access and indoor and outdoor stocking densities.</p>
<p>2. OBJECTIVES<br />The NOP requires professional consulting services for an independent economic impact analysis on proposed rules for the living conditions for organic poultry. The NOP will provide a draft outline of proposed regulation changes, highlighting areas of change from the present rule. This draft will be provided to the contractor by July 1. This draft may also include more than one option for regulatory text. <br />The contractor will provide a sound analysis, including a justification of its methodology. The analysis will estimate the cost and benefits of implementing the proposed rule, in comparison to alternatives (as per Exec. Order 12866). Alternatives will include (1) no change to existing rule, or (2) other options to be developed by NOP. All work will comply with the USDA Information Quality Activities Regulatory Guidelines. Final deliverable must be in the format for publication in the Federal Register. <br />3. SCOPE</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide professional consulting services necessary to develop an economic impact analysis for purposes of proposed rule publication regarding amendment to the requirements for poultry living conditions at 7 CFR 205.239. The contractor shall employ a proven methodology, based on past experience. The contractor shall gather input from relevant parties, such as agricultural economists, animal scientists, and biostatisticians, as well as individuals with first-hand knowledge of organic poultry production. This information will be used to analyze the predicted economic impact of the proposed rule. The status of baseline data on the organic poultry industry is unknown. The contractor should have the expertise to develop assumptions and economic models of potential impacts of the rule, if needed. Available data on organic production is limited; therefore, the contractor will be responsible for determining appropriate sources and methodology.</p>
<p>4. TASKS AND DELIVERABLES <br />This project will have three phases. Although the contractor may recommend additional steps or sub-tasks in its proposal, the proposal must demonstrate an ability to complete the following tasks:<br />Phase I<br />Evaluate and document a baseline scope of the industry. The contractor shall conduct data gathering on the following items, as well as any other topics deemed relevant to the regulations: <br />a) The volume and dollar value of current production of organic poultry products (eggs, broiler chickens, turkeys, other species);<br />b) The number of organic poultry operations (including a breakout of pullet and laying operations); <br />c) Range of scale of production (including a breakout of housing types by scale of production (e.g. aviary, or those enclosed structures currently providing outdoor access) <br />d) The geographic areas of production/distribution; <br />e) Marketing methods used for the product; <br />f) Cost of production, including infrastructure investments; <br />g) Trends in sales data over time; <br />h) information/data gaps; and <br />i) The confidence level of the estimates produced from the data. <br />Phase II<br />Establish an analysis of the economic impact of the proposed rule on small entities and evaluate whether alternative proposals can accomplish same effects without unduly burdening small entities.<br />Phase III<br />Prepare the economic analysis for inclusion in proposed regulations.<br />5. DELIVERABLES<br />Phase I: baseline report defining the economic landscape that the rulemaking will affect. Due August 1st, 2011. <br />Phase II: paper outlining an analysis of the economic impact of the proposed rule on small entities, and evaluate whether alternative proposals can accomplish same effects without unduly burdening small entities or erecting barriers that would restrict their ability to compete in the market, as per the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Due September 6th, 2011. <br />Phase III: written analysis for the inclusion in proposed rules, formatted for publication in the Federal Register. Due October 3rd, 2011. <br />Deliverable Review<br />NOP shall have 15 working days to review each draft and final deliverable. NOP shall have the right to reject or require the correction of any deficiencies found in the deliverables. In the event of rejection of any deliverables, the contractor shall be notified in writing and shall have 15 working days to correct the deficiencies at no additional cost to NOP. NOP shall have 15 working days to review corrections of any rejected deliverables. NOP will notify the contractor in writing that the required documents are sufficient to meet the above SOW requirements. Approvals of deliverables shall not be considered valid until the deliverables are approved in writing by NOP. In order to avoid problems with expectations of products, the contractor is encouraged to submit a draft document to NOP at 7 business days prior to final delivery to ensure acceptance criteria of products are met.<br />The Contractor shall formally respond to all written review comments from NOP within 5 business days of receipt or sooner. This response should indicate agreement/disagreement, and how the concern will be addressed within the next submission or resubmission. The final deliverable shall also include a traceability matrix indicating final disposition of all written review comments received.<br />All work products will become the intellectual property of USDA. The contractor may retain copies of scheduled reports and any deliverables that are available to the public. The contractor may not retain copies of any other deliverable.<br />Performance Monitoring<br />Performance will be monitored using the following methods:</p>
<p>&bull; In Process Review: The contractor shall be prepared to present periodic costs and performance information while in process. The focus shall be on identifying costs and schedule variances in completion of tasks. <br />&bull; Monthly Status Reports: The contractor shall provide a monthly status report via email for the project(s) within 5 days of the end of the month to the Federal Project Manager.</p>
<p>The following information is required for each monthly status report:</p>
<p>a) Hours and dollars billed per project, to include balance per project; <br />b) Summary of costs for each cost element (labor, travel, subcontracts, consultants, other direct costs, indirect costs) incurred during the period. <br />c) Activities achieved during the period based on agreed upon categories; <br />d) Status of deliverables during that period; <br />e) Estimate to complete all work remaining on the project, and projected monthly expenditures by project area to the completion date; and <br />f) Any other issues that need attention.</p>
<p>6. REQUIRED SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE<br />The contractor should have educational background in economic analysis, and be able to conduct research in current literature regarding economic status and trends of the organic marketplace. The ability to create new baseline data or to make assumptions using current economic models is necessary. The contractor should be able to demonstrate prior knowledge of the Organic Foods Production Act (enacted under Title 21 of the 1990 Farm Bill) and USDA organic regulations (7 CFR part 205). The contractor should be familiar with the regulatory drafting process, including compliance with Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.</p>
<p>7. PERIOD/PLACE OF PERFORMANCE<br />The period of performance is May 1- September 1, 2011. The agreement may be extended for up to 3 months beyond the end of the period of performance, dependent upon satisfactory performance and due to unforeseen delays in project completions, and/or substantial changes in the specifications.</p>
<p>The contractor may perform the work anywhere in the United States, but must be accessible by electronic mail and telephone. The NOP will provide workspace when travel to Washington DC from another location is necessary for this assignment. The government will provide all documentation related to the study and access to AMS resources/staff. Workspace in the NOP office will be provided as needed for meetings or occasional visits. No other equipment will be provided.</p>
<p>8. EVALUATION CRITERIA<br />The proposals will be evaluated on the likelihood of meeting the NOP's objectives. The evaluation will be based on the technical capabilities of the CONTRACTOR in relation to the needs of the project and the reasonableness of costs in relation to the work to be performed. Proposals will be based on the following factors: personnel to be assigned to the project, past performance, and price. <br />A. Key Personnel (50 points)<br />The proposal should indicate the adequacy of the proposed staff to implement the requirements of the Statement of Work, specifically evidence of qualifications, availability, competence, and experience. <br />B.

Is there a cost associated with this? <br />&bull; Is there a way for USAFA leadership to have insight into network usage?</p>
<p>We're also looking to provide service to shared areas where cadets congregate. These areas are approximately 50 additional rooms located throughout the two dormitory facilities. <br />&bull; What is the cost and implementation timeline estimate for this solution?</p>
<p>Are there any other aspects that we need to consider before contracting for this service?<br />Are there any comments concerning the NAICS and SBA size standards chosen for this RFI?</p>

<p>DLA Disposition Services is exploring alternatives for the disposal of DoD hazardous waste items currently located in Central Asia (to include the countries of Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Pakistan, and Kyrgyzstan). Among the alternatives being considered are local disposal/recycling options within the respective countries, as well as export and disposal outside of these countries in accordance with ADR and IMDG standards and all other applicable codes, laws, treaties, and so forth, with the contractor responsible for all coordination, necessary clearances and permits, customs requirements, and so forth.</p>
<p>Regardless of the method, DLA Disposition Services envisions multiple, multiyear firm fixed price contracts each with guaranteed minimums. DLA Disposition Services projects an estimated 750 metric tons of hazardous waste generated annually by the DoD in the region. Required services would include, but not be limited to, the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Verify shipments against stated inventories<br />&bull; Repackage waste <br />&bull; Complete waste profiles, manifests, and other shipping documentation<br />&bull; Arrange for interim storage of the waste (as necessary)<br />&bull; Obtain permits, customs clearance, and necessary export documentation (ie Basel)<br />&bull; Transport waste from U.S. military installations to interim storage and/or final disposal facilities<br />&bull; Disposing of the waste at qualified Treatment, Storage and Disposal Facilities (TSDFs)</p>
<p>Forms of waste include but are not limited to:</p>
<p>&bull; A variety of used and unused batteries (including lithium)<br />&bull; Solvents<br />&bull; Decontaminate agents and kits<br />&bull; Solid waste containing heavy metals<br />&bull; Mercury and mercury containing items<br />&bull; Pesticides/herbicides/fungicides/insecticides<br />&bull; Waste oil and fuel<br />&bull; Grease<br />&bull; PoL contaminated solids <br />&bull; Filters<br />&bull; Aerosol cans and other compressed gas cylinders<br />&bull; Asbestos items<br />&bull; Fire extinguishing residue<br />&bull; Uncontrolled medicine<br />&bull; Ethylene Glycol<br />&bull; Spill residue<br />&bull; Empty containers that previously held hazardous contents</p>
<p>The purpose of this request for information is twofold: 1) to identify the feasibility of such a contract, given the potential concerns and difficulties expected to be encountered by contractors when performing such a project in this area of operations; and 2) to identify the capability and interest of any firms wishing to be involved in such a project should a solicitation be pursued in the future.</p>
<p>The responses should address areas of this RFI, including the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Method of securing personnel and shipments<br />&bull; Potential transport, storage, and TSDF facilities (local or foreign)<br />&bull; Level of experience in hazardous waste management<br />&bull; Access to material handling equipment<br />&bull; Spill plan<br />&bull; Personnel planning<br />&bull; Level of experience working with the U.S. Government contracting.<br />&bull; Hazardous waste management plan<br />&bull; Potential concerns</p>
<p>Responses are requested in electronic format, either in Microsoft Word or Abode Acrobat format. All information submitted will be reviewed; however, DLA Disposition Services may not respond to any submissions.

<DESC>Background

The mission of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is to uncover new knowledge that will lead to better health for everyone. The NIH accomplishes that mission by conducting research in its own laboratories; supporting the research of non-Federal scientists in universities, medical schools, hospitals, and research institutions throughout the country and abroad; helping in the training of research investigators; and fostering communication of biomedical information.

The NIH Clinical Center (CC) is a 234-bed federally funded, biomedical research hospital located on the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland. The Clinical Center is the delivery setting for all NIH intramural clinical research protocols. The hospital complex consists of two main facilities that are connected to each other by bridges. The original 14-story building is 2.5 million square feet and continues to house the clinical laboratories, imaging sciences, surgical suites, and several outpatient clinics.  The new 870,000 square foot facility houses inpatient units and day hospitals.  The Clinical Center accounts for about half of all NIH-funded clinical research beds in the United States and accommodates about 7,000 inpatient and 70,000 outpatient visits a year. Patients are admitted to the NIH Clinical Center from all over the world for the sole purpose of participating in a clinical research protocol.

Patients are admitted to the NIH Clinical Center from all over the world for the sole purpose of participating in a clinical research protocol.

The Department of Radiology and Imaging Sciences (RAD&IS) provides imaging services to the CC patients who participate in research protocols conducted by the various NIH institutes.  Imaging services include X-rays, fluoroscopy, mammography, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, computed tomography (CT) scans and interventional radiology (special procedures).  Diagnostic services in ultrasound, digital mammography, positron emission tomography/computed tomography  (PET/CT), and nuclear medicine are also provided. All these diagnostic modalities generate clinical diagnostic images that are sent to and archived on the RAD&ISs Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS).   The departmental radiologists review the diagnostic images and dictate clinical findings using a Voice Recognition system (VRS).  The finds are saved in reports which are stored in the RAD&ISs Radiology Information System (RIS) and forwarded to the Clinical Research Information System or the Clinical Centers Hospital Information System (CRIS).
The Vitrea Enterprise Suite is a medical diagnostic imaging system that utilizes computerized visualization techniques to provide enhanced image displays, e.g. 3D or 4D displays.  .  The Vitrea Enterprise Suite provides the departmental radiologists with advanced visualization tools.  These tools are used as a means to further process and review patient images stored in the PACS for diagnostic and   research purposes.

<DESC><br />This is a Research and Development (R &amp; D) Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential R &amp; D requirement.
<p>Statement of Work</p>
<p>Background: We are in an era in which the comprehensive study of the DNA, RNA and proteins involved in physiological and pathophysiological states has become feasible and increasingly routine. These exciting molecular genetic approaches permit the study of biological information from a global-perspective. Technical advances and declining costs of high-throughput genotyping and genomic sequencing afford unparalleled opportunities to conduct increasingly complex analyses of genetic associations with phenotypic and disease characteristics. Genomic science is beginning to dissect the complex etiologies of eye diseases, and is poised to enter the realm of clinical ophthalmology. In fact, the body of work on the genetics of age-related macular degeneration was recognized by Science as one of the top ten scientific breakthroughs of 2006. Recent successes bode well for progress on advancing our understanding of genetic and environmental factors that confer the susceptibility to eye diseases may be rapid; however, the genetic architectures of these diseases are complex and challenges abound. Additional complexities will abound when such data are integrated with those from other domains, e.g., imaging, pharmacologic, behavioral, epidemiologic and clinical information.</p>
<p>Generation of terabytes of data across these multiple domains will push the frontiers of the molecular genetics of the eye disease toward information science and systems biology; however, ongoing efforts are independent and no strategy or blueprint has been developed to integrate all of these data in a way that will permit enable new conceptual advances through integrative, computational approaches. Most important is a heuristic by which these multiple domains of data can be integrated to develop new approaches to the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of eye diseases. A critically important and innovative approach to permit full interrogation of diverse data sets is to establish a cyber/bioinformatics infrastructure that fully incorporates all data - ranging from molecular and cellular studies in model systems through genetic, genomic, clinical and translational studies in humans - and that permits complex modeling and analysis. This cyber infrastructure will represent the coordinated aggregate of diverse data sets, analytic software tools, hardware and other technologies, as well as human expertise, required to support current and future research endeavors for the vision research community.</p>
<p>A cyber infrastructure for eye disease will integrate relevant and often disparate genetic, proteomic, imaging, clinical, epidemiologic resources to provide a useful, usable, and enabling framework for gene identification, molecular target discovery, drug screening and drug discovery that will be characterized by broad access and "end-to-end" coordination.</p>
<p>Objectives: This potential requirement requires the creation of a data sharing cyber infrastructure to benefit the eye disease research community. While data to support vision research has much in common with the data sharing found in other research communities, vision research does have unique data types and data sharing requirements, as well as unique workflows. Given that the advantages of exiting reusable data sharing infrastructure has not generally been leveraged by the vision research community, there needs to be an effort to take current best practice and apply it to create a persistent national scales data focused platform for facilitating vision research. There is a need to identify gaps in the current data sharing infrastructure that are important and to fill those gaps. Lastly, there is a need to demonstrate to the eye disease research community as a whole the utility of these types of shared cyber infrastructure via large-scale demonstration pilots.</p>
<p>Within the vision research community there is recognition and interests in the value that cyber/bioinformatics infrastructure can bring to the research community as a whole. Our approach will allow broad and open access to the scientific community, thereby providing researchers from across multiple disciplines (e.g., molecular and cellular neuroscience, systems biology, genomics, MRI physics, biomedical engineering, pharmacology and drug discovery) with the unparalleled opportunity to apply their cutting edge technologies to basic, clinical and translational research in eye disease. There are a range of NEI-funded multi-institutional and collaborative research activities that could utilize a data sharing infrastructure, but have yet to benefit from data-sharing infrastructure, either due to lack of expertise, experience and in some cases, lack of support for requirements which can build on existing infrastructure, yet are unique to eye research. Within the scope of this potential requirement, all of these barriers are to be addressed.</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health, National Eye Institute (NEI) would like to identify sources with the capability to develop and maintain data-sharing cyber infrastructure that supports a wide range of multi-institutional and collaborative research activities unique to eye research.</p>
<p>Technical Requirements: Use state-of-the-art methodologies and protocols to achieve all of the following requirements.</p>

<p>1) To create a cyber infrastructure that is optimized for the workflows associated with eye disease research.</p>
<p>- Develop a multidimensional cyber infrastructure that provides analytic tools and web accessible services for data integration and management, modeling, simulation, visualization and workflow to streamline and accelerate the investigation of the visual functions and eye diseases conducted by the scientific community at multiple levels, e.g., genomic, imaging, clinical.</p>
<p>2) Develop data sharing testbeds and populate them with relevant sharable data sets.<br /><br />- Create tools and graphical user interfaces for the integration of multiple data-sources, in order to interconnect multiple genetics, genomics, imaging, epidemiologic and other databases.</p>
<p>- Cyberplatform that includes interactive visualization tools to model genomic and other analyses, including epigenetics, gene - environment, and protein - protein interactions.</p>
<p>- Assure the security, privacy and confidentiality of eye disease data sets from multiple modalities through all cyber infrastructure components.</p>
<p>3) Demonstrate the utility of data sharing infrastructure for the vision research community.</p>
<p>- Create an operational testbed for the purpose of demonstrating that the infrastructure to be developed is capable of sharing the array of data relevant to vision research, and that data sharing by this mechanism is of tangible value. The testbeds will be used to create and evaluate at least three data sharing usecase that will include the clinics and research institutions conducting clinical research and cohort studies.</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)<br>Project Manager for Training Devices (PM TRADE), Live Training System (LTS)<br><br>1.0	Description<br><br>1.1 The U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), Project Manager for Training Devices (PM TRADE), Live Training System (LTS) is interested  in identifying innovative technologies or solutions for the development of a digital visual display for Indirect Fire (IF) weapons, i.e., Mk-19 Automatic Grenade Launcher, M203 Grenade Launcher, and M320 Grenade Launcher.  Purpose of this visual display will allow a soldier to view simulated rounds on a 2D or 3D digital terrain in a Force-on-Force (FoF) live training environment.  The visual display should provide Burst on Target (BOT) visual stimulus and feedback to the soldier so that the soldier will be able to view and engage live targets through Radio Frequency (RF) transmissions. The display will allow a soldier to look across an area to the intended live target while the visual display overlays data passed across a RF network which is synchronized to the soldier's location, orientation, and terrain. Data communication is typically accomplished via Player Units (PU) that interfaces with a RF network. This display should be able to interface via wire or preferably a Personal Area Network (PAN). It is anticipated that the visual display will be appropriate to the soldier's actual field of view in relation with the weapon either mounted on a vehicle platform or dismount on the ground without creating an interference or negative training.<br><br>1.2 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.

<DESC>&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Assured SATCOM Services In Single Theater (ASSIST)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Request for Information<br /></strong><br /><br /><strong>Contracting Office Address<br /></strong>Defense Information Systems Agency, Procurement and Logistics,<br />DITCO-Scott, 2300 East Drive Bldg 3600, Scott AFB, IL, 62225-5406 <br />
<p><strong><br />Purpose:</strong> The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) is seeking information regarding an end-to-end Ka- and Ku- commercial satellite communications (COMSATCOM) capability for Department of Defense theater specific operations.&nbsp; This Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a commitment for an RFP in the future.&nbsp; This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service.&nbsp; Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this announcement.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> COMSATCOM is an essential communications component for in-theater operations.&nbsp; The USCENTCOM theater of operations incurs the greatest amount of COMSATCOM usage, using Ku-band service on more than 20 different commercial communications satellites, mostly through the use of base period leases (typically single-year) with additional option year leases.&nbsp; Leases range from small fractions of a Transponded Equivalent (TPE) to multiple TPEs with an aggregate sustained demand of over 5 GHz of service and more than 1,200 terminal links/accesses.</p>
<p>With the Fiscal Year (FY) 2012 President's Budget Request, the DoD is preparing for an FY12-FY14 investment to acquire long-term satellite communications services in the Ka- and Ku-bands, preferably on a single satellite, to meet COCOM theater demand, directing as many future users and migrating as many existing users as possible from Ku to Ka-band.&nbsp; (Per Appendix A, Ground Tactical demand is envisioned migrating to Ka-band whereas AISR Demand will remain at Ku-band.)&nbsp; The investment includes both the space segment and associated terminals.&nbsp; Initially, the DoD goal is to reduce costs for COMSATCOM capability in the CENTCOM theater of operations.&nbsp; In the future, DoD requires the flexibility of moving these services to other theaters of operation as needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>DoD is evaluating several contracting vehicle options including possible use of the General Services Administration (GSA) Information Technology (IT) Schedule 70 Special Item Number (SIN) 132-54, Commercial Satellite Communications (COMSATCOM) Transponded Capacity, which was established as part of the Future COMSATCOM Services Acquisition (FCSA) to acquire the space segment service.&nbsp; DoD is evaluating several contracting vehicle options for acquiring, or modifying terminals and other necessary user equipment including possible use of GSA IT Schedule 70 SIN 132-3, 132-4, 132-8, and/or 132-9; the new GSA Custom SATCOM Solutions (CS2) and CS2 - Small Business ID/IQ contracts scheduled to be available by 4th Quarter FY2011; or another existing DoD contract focused on terminals and user equipment.</p>
<p><strong>[Note that Schedule 70 has an open enrollment provision, allowing interested vendors to apply at any time.&nbsp; The timeline to receive a Schedule 70 contract is typically four (4) months from submission of a complete proposal.&nbsp; Please see www.gsa.gov/schedule70 and www.gsa.gov/fcsa for further details.]&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The budgeted cost for the service is $440 million to include service operations and initial terminal modifications and replacements to use the space segment service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>DoD is seeking the following capabilities from this COMSATCOM service:&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Primary services supported at Ka frequencies (20.2-21.2 GHz on the downlink, 30.0-31.0 GHz on the uplink). The DoD will consider all industry solutions for securing orbital and frequency authorization and will assist with any approach deemed feasible based upon US domestic and international regulatory requirements. Industry would be solely responsible for obtaining licensing and orbital allocation using their normal process.<br /><br />-At least enough space resources to meet the current commercial SATCOM demand described in Appendix A. The objective is double demand documented in Appendix A with theater area beams.</p>
<p>-Service is available for use starting no later than 31 December 2014.</p>
<p>-Ability to support multiple changes to the theater of operation for the service over the lifetime of the lease.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Appendix A contains a summary of the current commercial SATCOM demand characteristics that make up the current Ku-band leases (Scenario #1). In addition, data is also provided about the currently deployed in-theater terminal population accessing these COMSATCOM services. An alternative scenario (Scenario #2) is also described to assess system extensibility.</p>
<p>Information Requested: The following questions are intended to help structure the acquisition of the stated COMSATCOM capability, including space segment service and terminals. Questions are intended to enable DoD to refine its strategy for this commercial SATCOM capability.</p>
<p><strong>Proprietary information or trade secrets should be clearly identified. All information received that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Technical<br />T1.</strong>What Ka-band and Ku-band services do you already have planned (or could provide) by the service start date? What is the design and on-orbit pedigree of the capability? What is the expected design and operating life?<br /><strong>T2.</strong>Assuming that the services you provide are initially to support the user population in Appendix A, Scenario 1, but later the services must be moved to another theater to support the user population shown in Appendix A, Scenario 2, what percentage of each Scenario's requirements do you estimate could be met with such a system or service? <br /><strong>T3.</strong>Describe the coverage, polarization, and bandwidth assignments of your proposed solution. Can the 30.0-31.0 GHz up / 20.2-21.2 GHz down gateway links be steerable? If so, how many can be supported? <br /><strong>T4.</strong>To what extent can some or all of the theatre Ka- and Ku-band coverages be steered to facilitate optimized service after repositioning? Can that Ka-band coverage be segmented and steered independently? <br /><strong>T5.</strong>What are the satellite station keeping requirements to achieve the forecasted performance of your solution?<br /><strong>T6.</strong>What terrestrial infrastructure (terminals, gateways, DoD gateways, network operations center (NOCs), hubs, terrestrial connectivity) is required to deliver your projected performance? Please include details on number of gateways required, number of terminals, connectivity, topology, terminal technical characteristics, polarization, use of multiple frequency bands to terminate user links, etc.)? Specify any assumptions you make.<br /><strong>T7.</strong>Describe the interoperability of your service with planned DoD military Ka-band systems (e.g., terminals that meet MIL-STD-188-164 and modems that meet MIL-STD-188-165.) To what extent would the performance discussed in T1 change if you were to rely exclusively on planned DoD Ka-band terminals and the planned modem inventory? (The WGS terminal population predominantly operates RHCP on the uplink and LHCP on the downlink with an axial ratio of &lt; 2dB. Select coverage areas on the WGS satellite are also capable of operating LHCP on the uplink and RHCP on the downlink, non-simultaneously. Select DoD Ka-band terminal types are capable of operating LHCP on the uplink and RHCP on the downlink, again, non-simultaneously.)<br /><strong>T8.</strong>Describe the major components of the system and service (e.g., satellite, gateways, terminals, modems, hubs, NOCs)? Describe the assumptions and function of each component and the extent to which forecasted performance is dependent on each component's characteristics to achieve the system performance forecast. <br /><strong>T9.</strong>Using the information in Appendix A, specify any user equipment changes needed. Include the estimated number of terminals that will need to be replaced. For new and replacement terminals, provide size, weight, and power demands of the equipment and any ruggedized characteristics of the equipment. To what extent does the performance of your solution require homogeneous terminal sizes/performance? What are the practical limits on diverse terminal sizes on your solution? To what extend is the performance of your solution dependent upon a specified connectivity type (e.g., hub-spoke only)? What is the impact to the performance if the service must support hub-spoke, point-to-point, and mesh connectivity.<br /><strong>T10.</strong>What terminals, modems, and network equipment are available that provide end-to-end service for your solution? From what sources can this equipment and terminals be procured?<br /><strong>T11.</strong>Describe the operations and control plan for your service including the location of the control facilities. Describe the process for a user to request and obtain service. Describe the security features that could be made available from that control facility. What tools would be necessary for the Government to provide payload configuration direction? Are those tools included in your solution and price estimates? Describe the functions and staffing of any NOC used for operations of comparable commercial systems.<br /><strong>T12.</strong>What are the information assurance features or characteristics of your service (e.g., TT&amp;C link encryption, network controls)? How compliant is it with the MAC I IA controls specified for GSA IT Schedule 70 SIN 132-54? (See Appendix B).<br /><strong>T13.</strong>Is your service capable of meeting the "Terms and Conditions Applicable to <br />Commercial Satellite Communications (COMSATCOM) Transponded Capacity (Special Item Number 132-54)"? (See 08_Proposal Price List Preparation document within Schedule 70 solicitation - http://www.gsa.gov/schedule70.) <br /><strong>T14.</strong>Describe your plan, including any steps requiring DoD activity, for gaining orbital slot approval for the space segment. What are the regulatory considerations and what is their impact on schedule? Cost considerations?</p>
<p><strong>Funding/ Contracting Mechanisms<br />F1.</strong>Provide a ROM total cost and the percentage for each cost element for your proposed solution.<br /><strong>F2.</strong>What are your standard payment practices for your proposed service? Are there specific payment models that you would recommend? Are there constraints should payment not occur until service delivery?<br /><strong>F3.</strong>What are your standard service agreements for leases of this duration? What arrangements do you enter into with commercial customers to provide them the assurance that you will deliver the service over the entire lease assuming full payment occurs no later than 2018?<br /><strong>F4.</strong>Assuming the last increment of funding is dispersed after successful service activation and the contractor will provide satellite operations for a period beyond that date, how does the Government ensure its service level agreement over that period between last payment and service end date is met (e.g., a liquidated damages clause (i.e., Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.211-11))? If so, what would be the possible terms and structure of such a liquidated damages clause?<br /><strong>F5.</strong>The Government is exploring the use of GSA IT Schedule 70 SIN 132-54 for acquiring space segment services. For the associated terminals, please describe your preferred contracting mechanism - GSA IT Schedule 70, or the CS2 and CS2 - Small Business ID/IQ contracts, or another existing DoD contract - for terminal leasing, procurement or modification and installation.

An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.
<p>Background: The Office of Child Care (OCC) falls within the Administration for Children and Families (ACF), in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The OCC supports low-income working families through child care financial assistance and promotes children's learning by improving the quality of early care and education and after-school programs. The OCC is responsible for administering the Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) - a program that helps low-income families access child care for children while parents work or participate in education or training. A portion of CCDF also is used to improve the quality of child care. In FY 2010, the OCC awarded $5 billion in CCDF funds to States, Territories, and Indian Tribes through block grants. States and Territories invest $1 billion each year in quality improvements.</p>
<p>OCC recognizes that CCDF lead agency quality improvement activities are at the core of what's needed to raise the bar on quality in child care and strongly supports state and territory continuous quality improvement program system efforts, including Quality Rating Improvement Systems (QRIS). Accordingly, OCC has placed a strong focus on understanding how CCDF programs fund and implement quality improvement. The FY 2012-2013 CCDF Plans revamped the quality section to better understand State and Territory activities, using the five key QRIS elements) as an organizing framework. For the first time, States and Territories will set goals to improve their health and safety systems and continuous quality improvement. In addition, OCC is pursuing multiple strategies to collect data on quality. States will report their quality activities and outputs on a new Quality Performance Report, which is an annual appendix to the CCDF Plan. In addition, OCC will pursue revisions to the CCDF financial reporting form to better describe spending on quality activity. And, for the first time, OCC will ask information about the quality of care that children are receiving as part of CCDF administrative data.</p>
<p>OCC has established a Child Care Technical Assistance Network (CCTAN) to support the work of States, Territories, and Tribes that administer the CCDF. In the years 2007-2011, CCTAN projects included: After-School Investments; the Center on the Social and Emotional Foundations for Early Learning; Child Care Aware; Child Care and Early Education Research Connections; the Child Care Information System Technical Assistance Project; the Communications Management Center; Healthy Child Care America; the National Child Care Information and Technical Assistance Center; the National Infant and Toddler Child Care Initiative; the Tribal Child Care Technical Assistance Center, and the Child Care Improper Payments Initiative.</p>
<p>In FY 2011, OCC will recompete its CCTAN to specialize its technical assistance (TA) in core areas, including the following new projects: the National Center on Child Care Quality Improvement; the National Center on Child Care Professional Development Systems and Workforce Initiatives; the National Center on Child Care Subsidy Innovation and Accountability; and the State Child Care Systems Specialist Network.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives: The purpose of this contract is to work with State and Territory CCDF grantees supporting innovation and replication of best practices regarding continuous quality improvement in child care. The Center will help grantees strengthen health and safety and licensing systems, which are the foundation of quality and support efforts to build quality improvement systems, with a special focus on QRIS. The Center will work with CCDF grantees to support the coordination and alignment of quality improvement system activities that spans a wide variety of child care, Head Start, pre-kindergarten, and after school programs. Major objectives and activities to be undertaken are: providing targeted TA to State and Territory grantees as they set goals for their quality activities in their 2012-2013 CCDF Plans; developing TA products to help State and Territory grantees track progress and identify outcomes and milestones for the OCC's new Quality Performance Report; and tracking developments in the field in these areas and update state profiles on the OCC benchmarks.</p>
<p>Project Requirements:</p>
<p>o The Contractor's staff will have expert level knowledge of how CCDF program and policies are administered at the state level; and operational knowledge of and expertise in the broad areas covered by the Center, including the full range of issues and services and new directions within the child care field.</p>
<p>o The Contractor will employ a project director with relevant experience in managing projects of this scope and complexity, preferably with CCDF issues and subject matter experts that have formal education experience in coordination of high quality early childhood development and school age services and early childhood and school age system reform.</p>
<p>o The Contractor will share information and coordinate efforts, as appropriate to advance state level system development and integration, with the National Center on Child Care Professional Development Systems and Workforce Initiatives, and National Center on Child Care Subsidy Innovation and Accountability.</p>

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman', 'serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi">The General Services Administration Central Heating &amp; Refrigeration Plant (GSA CHRP) provides steam and chilled water to over 100 government facilities in the Washington DC area.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At the Central Plant, HOTD operates eight (8) Johnson Controls (formerly York International) chillers and two surface condensers. The chillers and surface condensers are critical to HOTD's mission of producing chilled water to its customers and should be maintained to prevent failure due to mechanical or electrical faults which result in downtime and production losses. The eight (8) chillers of interest include seven (7) R-134a chillers and one (1) R-22 chiller (Chiller #4A). Also, six (6) of the eight chillers are electrically driven while two are steam driven. Operational inspection and preventative maintenance (PM) of the chillers and surface condensers will help to alleviate problematic faults caused from wiring and electrical connections, compressor motor malfunction and inefficiency caused by physical degradation from wear and tear on the mechanical components of the chillers. Performing preventative maintenance of the chillers and their associated systems will provide historical data on each chiller, benefitting both technicians and engineers alike. This will help to track maintenance on each chiller and highlight system problems as they develop, thus increasing chiller reliability and facilitating continuous chilled water production.</span></p>

<DESC>SEMI-ACTIVE LASER (SAL) SEEKER REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)
<p>Synopsis:</p>
<p>I. Description</p>
<p>The USAF Air Armament Center Capabilities Integration Directorate (AAC/XR) Intra-Theater/Close-Control Strike Integrated Product Team (IPT) is requesting information on SAL seekers for use in guidance packages for a variety of air-to-ground weapons. This information will assist Air Force decision makers in evaluating existing, modified, and new air-delivered weapons for potential use given cost, effectiveness, platform load-out, and logistical constraints.</p>
<p><br />II. Background</p>
<p>LASER-guided weapons were first developed by the Air Force in the late 1960's. Since then, a myriad of SAL seekers, with a variety of physical properties and capabilities, have been developed and employed. AAC/XR is attempting to re-baseline the state of the art for SAL seekers looking for potential incorporation into a variety of air-to-ground weapons.</p>
<p>III. Technical Objectives</p>
<p>Identified SAL systems should be at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 or greater. Our interest ranges from stand-alone, single-aperture systems to distributed-aperture systems intended to leave internal volume for other functions. Seeker diameter can range from 1 inch to 6 inches. System identification should include the following information:</p>
<p>Dimensions<br />Weight<br />Power Required<br />Aperture Type (e.g. Distributed or Single)<br />Gimbaled or Strapdown<br />Optics (if integral)<br />Linear Field of View (LFOV)<br />Angular Accuracy in the LFOV<br />Field of Regard (FOR), Ungimbaled <br />Field of Regard (FOR), Gimbaled <br />LASER Energy (at the aperture) Range of Operation (min detection to saturation, X to Y millijoules)<br />Sensitivity at a range of 5 Km<br />Operating Temperature Range<br />Sensitivity over Temperature Range<br />Dynamic Threshold<br />Instantaneous Dynamic Range<br />LASER Code Input (type, input method)<br />Technology Readiness Level (TRL)<br />Approximate Cost per unit for quantity buys of 10, 100, and 1,000</p>
<p><br />IV. Government Information</p>
<p>THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED. This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as a Request for Proposal (RFP) or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs of charges by the Government will arise due to contractor submission of responses to this RFI or the Government's use of such information. The Government may issue an RFP after reviewing the information submitted in response to this RFI. Contractors that do not submit information in response to this announcement will not be precluded from submitting a proposal to any subsequent RFP. However, any acquisition strategy will be defined based on the information submitted in response to this RFI, so maximum participation is highly encouraged. AAC/XR uses Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance (SETA) contractors to fulfill its mission requirements and to review technology capabilities solicited in this RFI. Service contracts contain an organizational conflict-of-interest clause that requires service contractors to protect the data and prohibits them from using the data for any purpose other than for which it was presented. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any contractor's input resulting from this RFI. This RFI does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract. No funds have been authorized, appropriated, or received for this contemplated effort. The information provided may be utilized by the Department of Defense in developing its acquisition strategy, including creation of Initial Capabilities Documents. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only. It does not constitute a formal RFP, and should not be construed as such as a commitment by the U.S. Government. All information contained in this RFI is preliminary, and subject to modification.</p>
<p><br />V. Responses</p>
<p>The information submitted should include the general characteristics identified under section III, Technical Objectives. Respondents to this RFI are encouraged to provide relevant examples of ongoing and previous contractual efforts with the Government that support the desired capabilities described. Respondents may be requested to provide additional information/details based on their initial submittals. Industry is encouraged to respond with information not constrained by proprietary data rights. However, if proprietary data is included in your reply, please mark it appropriately. Any subsequent actions resulting from the evaluation of the information provided because of this RFI may be synopsized at a future date. Responses to this RFI may be classified. Classified responses should be properly marked and packaged. For instructions on submitting classified information, contact: Christine Wicker at (850) 883-4925 or christine.wicker@eglin.af.mil.

<DESC>Notice of Intent-The U.S. Fish and Wildlife service plans to award a fixed-price purchase order under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart  6.302-1, Other Than Full and Open Competition and FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  This acquisition is required to support the Sheldon Hart Mountain Refuge Complex in Lakeview, Oregon.
Wildlife tracking collars will be used to mark individual pronghorn.  Because of the small size of the species and its limited capacity to safely carry a collar without injury, the selected collars must be within precise weight and size specifications.  Advanced Telemetry Systems is the manufacture that can meet capture pronghorn collaring specifications. In Addition, it is very expensive and difficult to capture wildlife for collaring, and poor collar design can significantly injure an animal.  Advanced Telemetry Systems have a long-standing and proven track record of reliability and animal safety, including models deployed specifically on pronghorn that have been shown to have an excellent record of safety for the animals.  Of three manufactures surveyed, Advanced Telemetry is the most cost-effective; offering equipment within the total acceptable weight; and provides all equipment with the required specifications.  
Specifications include a) total collar weight <410 grams, b)collar size no more than 1.5 inches wide with neoprene belting,  c)collar circumference 13-14 inches, d)minimum 2-year operational lifespan, e) user programmable, built-in, and timed drop-off function.
No solicitation or Request for Quote (RFQ) is available for this procurement.  Nevertheless, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting the requirements described herein may submit a response no later than May 26, 2011 by COB to be considered.  A determination not to compete the described purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the US Fish and Wildlife Service.  Any questions or comments should be directed to Linda Askew, via email at linda_askew@fws.gov.

<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's Office of Water (OW) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, they were awarded competitively, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing OW contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OW contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey intends to make a non-competitive award to Seismic Micro-Technology, Inc. Houston, Texas to purchase new licenses and maintenance contracts from Seismic Micro-Technology (SMT) of Houston, Texas for Windows software to support interpretation of 2D and 3D seismic reflection profile data, geophysical well logs, and production data.  This software will be used in numerous projects, including Geologic Carbon Sequestration, Assessment Alaska Petroleum Resources, Gulf of Mexico Framework and Petroleum Assessments, Appalachian Basin Framework and Petroleum Assessments, and Eastern Gas Shales.  Services to be acquired include the maintenance: (1) Technical support of the software via telephone calls, facsimile transmissions, and email. (2) Correction of any software performance errors detected by USGS users and reported to vendors technical support system. (3) Upgrades, including new releases and revisions of the software that incorporate enhancements and error corrections. This service shall be provided for a period of 3 years, from May 17, 2011 through May 16, 2014, and shall be non-severable during that period of time.  
Seismic Micro-Technology, Inc. is the only known source for this requirement because no other sources are known to process the unique and essential qualifications because Seis Vision is deficient in many of the required features (license manager, shapefile and geotitt  base map layers) and support for the product is being phased out.  Loading data in SeisVision has proven problematic for USGS data sets. Seis Vision projects cannot be exchanged with the Kingdom Suite, which severely limits collaborative exchanges with other USGS offices and external collaborators.     
THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. The Government intends to award this requirement noncompetitively IAW FAR 13.106-1(b)(1). Other interested concerns having the ability to furnish this item shall submit a capabilities statement to the Contract Specialist no later than the closing date of this announcement.  FAX response to 703.648.7367 or email to: abenton@usgs.gov.  All submissions will be evaluated to determine if competitive opportunities exist. 
The NAICS code is 811212
The anticipated award date of the contract is 05/27/2011.  A vendor must be registered at http://www.ccr.gov to be awarded the contract.

<SOLNBR>W81XWH-PRORP-RFI
<ARCHDATE>08162011
<CONTACT>Susan Dellinger, 301-619-2090

<a href="mailto:susan.dellinger@us.army.mil">US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity</a>
<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) Only!<br><br>Issued for: The Peer Reviewed Orthopaedic Research Program (PRORP), Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs, United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command<br><br>Background: The Peer Reviewed Orthopaedic Research Program was established within the Defense Health Program of the Department of Defense to support research focused on optimizing recovery and restoration of function for military personnel with orthopaedic injuries sustained in combat or combat-related duties. The PRORP is considering offering program announcements to solicit for mature translational and clinical trial research projects, and is issuing this RFI to survey available and/or emerging biomedical technologies that have the potential to address the following focus areas of interest:<br><br>A. Prevention and treatment of post traumatic osteoarthritis: Post traumatic osteoarthritis is the most common chronic, debilitating condition of combat-injured Warriors.  Most incidences of post traumatic osteoarthritis are caused by fractures involving the joints.  The PRORP is interested in mature translational and clinical research aimed at preventing or treating this condition. Preventive measures must consider the battlefield environment constraints (to include but not limited to multiple serious injuries, anticoagulation effects of medication, and limited imaging capabilities for the first 72 hours).  Regenerative approaches must be able to repair large cartilage defects that current therapies (such as microfracture and osteochondral transplantation) do not address.  <br><br>B. Improved outcomes of severe limb injuries: The majority of combat-injured Warriors have at least one extremity injury, most of which are open wounds caused by explosion or gunshot.  These injuries are generally more severe than civilian injuries, with infection and nonunion as common complications.  Nonfunctional nerves and loss of muscle function are frequent outcomes.  Clinical studies on approaches to reduce or treat infection, therapies that heal large motor nerve injury, and novel rehabilitation interventions or orthoses that improve the functional outcomes of individuals with severely injured limbs are needed. <br><br>C. Improved outcomes of multi-limb trauma patients: Combat casualties facing multiple major limb amputations or severe limb-threatening injuries requiring salvage techniques represent a small but very important subset of patients. Clinical studies to examine surgical, rehabilitative and psychosocial aspects of coping with and returning to life afterwards; as well as treatment strategies to improve outcomes in these specific patients will be considered.  <br><br>D. Upper Extremity Prosthetic: Combat-injured Warriors that have lost one or both arms have limited options in reliable prosthetics that are lightweight, easy to control, and flexible. The PRORP is interested in advanced technology that could be used to develop and test a modular, interoperable, three-degrees-of-freedom (DOF), powered prosthetic wrist and one DOF terminal device with accompanying control strategies. Of highest interest is technology that solves unmet clinical needs, with priority given to function, weight, reliability, and durability, rather than cosmetic appearance.  Interest is in candidate solutions and prototype systems at the stage of refinement and initial feasibility testing or beyond. <br><br>Information Requested: To respond to this RFI, please address the following questions. It is requested that each response address a single focus area. If you would like to comment on multiple focus areas, you are encouraged to submit multiple responses.<br><br>1) What novel approaches that meet the above focus areas are sufficiently developed for clinical trial research? Please describe any relevant research of which you are aware, with brief details about each therapeutic or preventive intervention, and the stage of clinical development in progress. If relevant, include information on Investigational New Drug or Investigational Device Exemption status.<br><br>2) What novel approaches that meet the above focus areas are not yet ready for clinical trial, but are considered to be at a mature translational research stage? Briefly describe each relevant approach, including status of any animal or observational/clinical validation, technology development, and manufacturing progress. Estimate time needed for additional research and development before clinical trial readiness.<br><br>3) With regard to upper limb powered prosthetic solutions, please describe current capabilities to assemble a modular three DOF wrist, specifying the size and weight footprints of each possible configuration in order to evaluate the limitations for fitting based on residual limb length. Briefly describe design of the terminal device and accompanying powering technology. Describe any approaches that capitalize on and augment the features of existing body-powered devices to create an evolutionary externally powered product. Discuss the modularity of the system both in terms of physical assembly and control capability. Responses should include information on the extent to which each technological component of the system has been proven, as well as compatibility across other prosthetic systems and manufacturers.<br><br>Response and Process: To facilitate review of responses, please clearly mark which of the above focus areas is relevant to the response. Please respond no later than June 8, 2011. Responses should be limited to 500 words or less, and can be submitted to cdmrp.prorp@amedd.army.mil. No telephone calls please.<br><br>NOTE:  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation or issuance thereof.  All information received in response to this RFI that is marked proprietary will be handled accordingly.  Responses to this RFI will not be returned.  Responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract or award.  Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.<br>

The RAM and System Assessment Division, Redstone Arsenal intends to award a sole source contract to Lighthouse Risk, LLC for the perofrmance of Acutarial Support.

To be eligible for award the offeror's response to the RFQ must include the following: PRICE and PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION as described below.</p>
<p>b. The contracting officer has determined there is a high probability of adequate price competition in this acquisition. Upon examination of the initial offers, the contracting officer will review this determination and if, in the contracting officer's opinion, adequate price competition exists no additional cost information will be requested. However, if at any time during this competition the contracting officer determines that adequate price competition no longer exists; offerors may be required to submit information to the extent necessary for the contracting officer to determine the reasonableness and affordability of the price.</p>
<p>1. PRICE INFORMATION</p>
<p>Insert proposed UNIT and EXTENDED prices for all Contract Line Items (CLINS) listed above. The extended amount must equal the whole dollar unit price multiplied by the number of units. Include any pertinent information regarding industry standards that may be applicable.</p>
<p>2. PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION</p>
<p>Provide a list of no more than three (3) references of the most relevant contracts performed for commercial customers, Federal agencies, or other military organizations that have used, or are currently using the same or similar service proposed for this contract. Only references for same or similar services or contracts are desired. The government will evaluate the quality and extent of an offeror's performance deemed relevant to the requirements of this solicitation. A past performance survey will be provided to the references provided. Relevancy is defined as:</p>
<p>Relevant - Present/Past performance effort involved much of the same or similar requirements as defined in the performance work statement.</p>
<p>Somewhat Relevant - Present/Past performance effort involved some of the same or similar requirements as defined in the performance work statement.</p>
<p>Not Relevant - Present/Past performance effort involved either very limited or no services similar in scope, magnitude, and complexity this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>The evaluation of past performance information will take into account past performance information regarding key personnel who have relevant experience or subcontractors that will perform major critical aspects of the requirement when such information is relevant to the instant acquisition. Furnish the following information for each reference:</p>
<p>(i) Company/Division name<br />(ii) Services provided<br />(iii) Contracting Agency/Customer<br />(iv) Contract Number<br />(v) Contract Dollar Value<br />(vi) Period of Performance<br />(vii) Verified up-to-date name, address, email address, FAX and telephone number(s) for each <br />company Point of Contact. <br />(viii) Comments regarding compliance with contract terms and conditions<br />(ix) Comments regarding any known performance deemed unacceptable to the customer, or not in <br />accordance with the contract terms and conditions.</p>
<p>(d) Completed performance surveys are not to be reviewed by the offeror. ONCE THE SURVEY IS COMPLETED, IT IS CONSIDERED FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY, and is only viewed by Government personnel directly involved in the evaluation process for this acquisition.</p>
<p>(e) Contracts provided must be recent, meaning services performed or completed in the past three years.</p>
<p>ADDENDUM TO 52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999).</p>
<p>a. BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD: The Government intends to award contract to offeror which represents best overall value in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13 in which competing offerors' past performance history and price will be considered. By submission of its offer, the offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors or sub factors. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Offerors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale.</p>
<p>b. The evaluation will be conducted using simplified procedures outlined in FAR 13.106. In accordance with simplified procedures, contracting offices may conduct comparative evaluations of offers. Evaluation of other factors, such as past performance --<br />(i) Does not require the creation or existence of a formal data base; and<br />(ii) May be based on one or more of the following:<br />(A) The contracting officer's knowledge of and previous experience with the supply or service being acquired;<br />(B) Customer surveys, and past performance questionnaire replies;<br />(C) The Government wide Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) at <a href="http://www.ppirs.gov">www.ppirs.gov</a>; or<br />(D) Any other reasonable basis.</p>
<p>c. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows: <br />Step 1. Rank all proposals by price. The contracting officer is allowed to make comparative analysis of offers to establish best overall value to the government. <br />Step 2 - Evaluate all quotes for ability to meet all requirements of the solicitation. Offerors that do not conform fully to the solicitation will not be considered.<br />Step 3 - Review any and /or all past performance information available utilizing performance information provided by the contractor, performance questionnaires, PPRIRS, contracting officer's personal knowledge, or any other reasonable basis. Using questionnaires, the contracting officer shall seek relevant performance information based on (1) the past and present efforts provided by the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources. Relevant performance includes performances contracts that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation. <br /><br />d. PAST PERFORMANCE RATINGS: The performance assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of Substantial Confidence, Satisfactory Confidence, Limited Confidence, No Confidence or Unknown Confidence as defined in AFFARS Mandatory Procedures 5315.3, Table 3 and shown below. Offerors with no relevant or recent past or present performance history shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence", meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. Confidence ratings are defined as follows:</p>
<p>SUBSTANTIAL CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>SATISFACTORY CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has an expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>LIMITED CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>NO CONFIDENCE: Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>UNKNOWN CONFIDENCE: No performance record is identifiable or the offeror's performance record is limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.</p>
<p>f. When determining relevancy and assigning a past performance confidence rating, the government will consider the type of experience, the amount of experience, and the flexibility of contractor to meet customer needs.</p>
<p>Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will not be considered as highly as past performance information from the principal offeror. Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history or the offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence," meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. If the prime contractor has no past performance and is relying on their subcontractor's past performance, the prime contractor will be assessed an unknown confidence rating and, depending on the past performance information on the subcontractor, their past performance will be assessed as defined in AFFARS Mandatory Procedures 5315.3, Table 3 and then the two ratings will be combined.</p>
<p>g. In evaluating past performance, the government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.</p>
<p>h. If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance rating that offer represents the best value for the Government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.</p>
<p>The government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offeror if the lowest priced offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower and it is in the best interest of the government to do so.</p>
<p>i. If the lowest priced offeror is not judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the next lowest priced offeror will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offeror is judged to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment or until all offerors are evaluated.</p>
<p>j. Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in the proposals preparation instructions. Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Adverse past performance is defined as past performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors would not constitute discussions and the contracting officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.</p>
<p>k. The government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors. The government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if they are deemed to be in the best interest of the government.</p>
<p>(End of Addendum)</p>

<p>ADDENDUM - Performance Work Statement <br />Survey Activity Leader<br />25 April 2011</p>
<p>1 Description of Services. The United States Air Force Academy has a requirement for a Survey Activity Leader to provide surveying support to instructors teaching cadets survey techniques in field conditions for the Department of Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering at the US Air Force Academy, Colorado. The Period of Performance is 30 May, 2011 through 18 June, 2011.</p>
<p>1.1. Background. CE351 is an integrated, two phase program that takes place over a five week period. The first phase is Operation Civil Engineering Air Force ( OPS CEAF). Students spend two weeks at an operational Air Force base in order to gain an appreciation of Air Force missions, support functions, and civil engineering capabilities. The second phase is the Field Engineering and Readiness Laboratory (FERL). During this three-week phase, students "deploy" to the FERL training area to perform hands-on activities in surveying, construction methods, and construction materials under the supervision and guidance of mentors. Students will gain experience working and living under field conditions as they use some of the readiness assets used in the Operational Air Force. The FERL concept is now in its 17th year of implementation. The program could not be successful without the contributions of Active-duty, Guard, Reserve and civilian personnel who serve as mentors for the cadets. Mentors provide functional expertise in their specialties and serve as role models in an advisory capacity. During FERL, mentors work alongside cadets on activities such as concrete placement, roadway construction, surveying, heavy equipment operations, power production, welding, water treatment and wood frame construction. These tasks and more were selected to provide cadets with broad exposure to the Civil Engineering career field.</p>
<p>1.2. Specific Requirements</p>
<p>1.2.1. Provide daily instructional knowledge of the following survey instruments provided for the use of the students: Auto Level and associated accessories necessary for a level circuit; total Station and associated accessories necessary to conduct a closed traverse; survey grade GPS and programmable GPS navigation units and accessories necessary to conduct the crash survey activity.</p>

<p>1.2.4. Rate field work, provide a report of each student's participation in that day's activity, and assist the instructor in assigning grades. There are an estimated 100 cadets that will participate in this effort. The cadets will be divided into five groups of approximately 20 each. The course is structured for each group of 20 to attend the course one day per week.</p>
<p>1.2.5. Support the FERL Commander during the Department of Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering (DFCE) annual Field Engineering &amp; Readiness Laboratory (CE351) course. This support consists of leading up to five active duty, Reserve/Guard, or civilian engineering technicians providing field instruction to an estimated 100 Air Force, Army, Coast Guard, or ROTC cadets during survey activities.</p>
<p>1.3. Estimated Course Schedule (1100-1700 first Monday and 0730-1630 all other days):<br />Week 1- Monday: Fundamentals of Surveying, Tuesday-Saturday: Vertical Control/Level Loop<br />Week 2- Monday-Friday: Horizontal Control/ Closed Traverse<br />Week 3- Monday-Friday: GPS/Crash Survey</p>

<p>1.6. Quality Assurance. The government will provide quality assurance oversight to the extent to ensure requirements of the performance work statement are fulfilled. This may include review of logs, documentation, and general review of the contractor performance. Critical areas are outlined in the Service Delivery Summary.</p>
<p>2. Government Furnished Property</p>
<p>2.1. The government will provide the following: All surveying and course materials.</p>
<p>2.2. The contractor is not responsible for providing any material or surveying equipment.</p>
<p>3. General Information</p>

Look for oil leakage from the bearing.<br />b. Clean the cooling fins on the bearing pedestal and the bearing insulation.<br />c. Make sure the insulation is not bridged by dirt.<br />7.2.3.4 Look for leakage of water from the cooler pipe joints.<br />7.2.3.5 Open the emergency panel and look inside with a light.</p>
<p>7.2.4. The Polarization Index (PI) of a generator's windings.</p>
<p>7.2.4.1 Before measuring the insulation resistance, remove all external connections to the machine and completely discharge the windings to the grounded machine frame.<br />7.2.4.2 Apply a constant 500 volts DC between the winding and the ground using a direct-indicating megohmeter, for 10 minutes.<br />7.2.4.3 The PI is a calculated ratio of the 10-minute to the 1-minute value of the insulation resistance, measured consecutively. Record resistance values after 1-minute and after 10-minutes. The calculation is as follows:<br />Polarization Index (PI) = Resistance after 10 minutes/Resistance after 1 minute<br /><br />7.2.4.4Tested values should be compared against previous readings to track changes. If history is not available, the recommended minimum values of PI for all machine components insulation classes per IEC 60085-01:1984 are: <br />Thermal Class Rating --- Minimum PI<br />Class A --- 1.5<br />Class B --- 2.0<br />Class F --- 2.0<br />Class H --- 2.0<br />Notes:<br />These are the lowest values at which a winding is recommended for an over-voltage test or for operation.<br />The PI test is not applicable to non-insulated field windings. <br />Very high PI (greater than 8) for varnished cambric, shellac mica-folium, or asphaltic stator windings may indicate that the insulation has been thermally aged and may be at risk of failure. Physical inspection can be used to confirm if the insulation is dry and brittle.<br />7.2.4.5 Check brushes for any damage, excessive wear or excessive deterioration.<br />7.2.4.6 Check for proper spring tension.<br />7.2.4.7 Inspect brushes for freedom of movement in holder (Brush length, replace if required)<br />7.2.4.8 Inspect brushes for contact to commutator<br />7.2.4.9 Inspect brush holders and rigging for alignment.

<p>STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>Introduction: The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) owns/operates four deHavilland Twin Otters (DHC-6-300). These aircraft perform high-altitude atmospheric research, conduct marine mammal research at low altitude, and fly coastal mapping missions. These operations are conducted throughout the continental United States as well as Alaska and occasionally foreign countries. Maintenance support is typically provided by Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) Aviation Technicians. These individuals routinely need to purchase parts and supplies in order to conduct maintenance at the AOC hangar. They also need to order parts and have them sent to other locations where the aircraft is stationed and have a local mechanic provide installation support. This Statement of Work is for an Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity type multiyear contract to include a base year and four (4) option years. In anticipation of common maintenance actions needing to be funded, the parts and scope will vary from year to year as requirements change but a minimum amount to be funded each year will be $10,000.00 with an estimated maximum amount of $150,000.00 each year.</p>
<p>A.1 Scope: AOC requires parts logistics for the replacement, repair, overhaul and/or manufacture services for parts and components for the NOAA Twin Otter aircraft. This acquisition will allow for the purchase of: new, serviceable, overhauled, overhaul-exchange, repaired, or contractor manufactured parts that are necessary to maintain operational status of the NOAA Twin Otters. This service will provide AOC or AOC designated contract maintenance facilities the necessary parts to make repairs to NOAA aircraft with discrepancies discovered during: scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, unscheduled component failures, and early component wear-out. The contractor shall comply with applicable Federal Aviation Regulation and all aircraft manufacturer's requirements. Contractor must be both a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approved component repair station and a FAA approved manufacturing facility for the Twin Otter. Copies of both FAA approvals/certificates are required to be given to the Government. The contractor will provide all special tools, facilities, equipment, and certified technical staffing to perform delivery orders in relation to parts logistics and Aircraft-On-Ground (AOG) technical assistance. The Government shall be responsible for scheduling and ordering all parts against this contract. The Government reserves the right to exercise or cancel any part of this agreement.</p>
<p>AOG technical assistance is required. Contractor shall have a 24 hour 7 day a week "Hot Line" available for direct parts assistance to AOC and/or NOAA Twin Otter pilots and/or other contract facility for AOG situations.</p>

The snow amounts reported by the National Weather Service reached a maximum depth of 37 inches on the ground in 2006.  The area has the potential for the Hantavirus; a potentially fatal disease spread by the droppings of certain rodents. While not an imminent danger, engineering measures must be taken to reduce the potential of rodent infestation of the structure.  The park is inhabited by several species of reptile. One, the prairie rattlesnake is venomous. Engineering measures should be taken to prevent the snake from inhabiting the structure.  Additionally, fabric used for exterior walls and roof must comply with National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), Section 101, Chapter11, Paragraph 11.11, Tents as it references fire standards for tents.

<p>It is the mission of the Federal Communications Commission to ensure that the American people have available - at reasonable costs and without discrimination - rapid, efficient, nation- and world-wide communication services; whether by radio, television, wire, satellite, or cable. As such the FCC has a need to provide transportation subsidies to its employees.</p>
<p>2. SCOPE OF WORK</p>
<p>The purpose of this requirement is to purchase transportation subsidies.</p>
<p>3. TASKS</p>
<p>a. The Contractor shall enroll the Federal Communications Commission for participation in the SmartBenefits&reg; program, which is a Web-based program that will allow the Federal Communications Commission to assign the dollar values of participants' monthly benefits for commuting to and from work directly to the participants' SmarTrip&reg; cards. Commuting benefits may include transit for Metrorail, Metrobus, regional commuter bus and rail systems as applicable, and van pools. <br />b. The Contractor shall make Federal Communications Commission -designated amounts of transit benefits available for each participant to download on his or her SmarTrip&reg; card by the first calendar day of the month that the benefits are effective.<br />c. The Contractor shall provide training on the SmartBenefits&reg; system onsite at the Federal Communications Commission offices in Washington, DC for up to ten (10) Federal Communications Commission employees per session, as requested by the Federal Communications Commission.<br />d. Upon request by (company or agency name) through the SmartBenefits&reg; system, the Contractor shall provide SmartBenefits&reg; paper vouchers for Board participants to use for approved commuter rail and buses (to include, but not necessarily be limited to, transportation provided by Keller Transportation, Dillon's Bus Service, Inc., Eyre Bus Service, Inc., the Maryland Area Regional Commuter train service, and Virginia Rail Express). The Contractor shall deliver paper vouchers to the Federal Communications Commission via courier or Federal Express within seven (14) business days of the order, or, if Federal Communications Commission wishes to pick up the vouchers at the Contractor's site, the Contractor shall make arrangements for the COTR to do so within seven (14) business days of the order.<br /><br />If the Contractor eliminates the availability of SmartBenefits&reg; paper vouchers at any time during the period of performance of this Statement of Work and the related purchase order, the Contractor will not be obligated to provide the vouchers to Federal Communications Commission. The Contractor shall notify Federal Communications Commission Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) in writing (via e-mail) in the event that it eliminates the availability of the vouchers.</p>
<p><br />4. GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBILITIES:</p>
<p>a. The Federal Communications Commission will access the SmartBenefits&reg; program via the internet and will enter the amount of transit benefit approved for each participant no later than the fifteenth calendar day of each month.</p>
<p>b.

<p>c. Federal Communications Commission will provide the following information to the Contractor through the Web-based SmartBenefits&reg; program so that transit fare will be added to participants' SmarTrip&reg; cards:</p>
<p>(1) Full name of each participant</p>
<p>(2) Each participant's SmarTrip&reg; card number</p>
<p>(3) Amount of transit benefit approved for each participant (benefit category type)</p>
<p>(4) Start date for each participant's benefits</p>
<p>(5) User-defined key (In Federal Communications Commission case, this can be each participant's Federal Communications Commission employee identification number.)</p>
<p>5. SECURITY OF PERSONAL DATA</p>
<p>The services to be performed under this Statement of Work require the exchange of personal data between Federal Communications Commission and the Contractor. The Contractor, by acceptance of or performance on this Contract, certifies that it has a security policy in place which contains procedures to promptly notify Federal Communications Commission of the name(s) of any participant whose personal information was, or is reasonably believed to have been, lost or acquired by an unauthorized person.</p>
<p>6. SECTION 508 OF THE REHABILITATION ACT OF 1973 <br />Because (company or agency name) complies with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and its regulations thereunder (Section 508), to the extent that the Contractor will utilize software applications and operating systems, web-based intranet or internet information and applications, or video and multimedia products in providing services under this Statement of Work, the Contractor must certify that they meet the applicable requirements of Section 508 (e.g., 36 C.F.R. Parts 1194.21, 1194.22, 1194.24, 1194.31, and 1194.41).</p>
<p>7.

<DESC>Sampling and Stable Isotopic Analysis of Walrus Teeth.  The U.S. Geological Survey Alaska Science Center, has a requirement to perform stable isotopic analysis of individual growth layer groups (GLG) from walrus teeth. This is in support of tasks related to USGSs Changing Arctic Ecosystems Initiative. This particular solicitation is part of a larger project to evaluate the status of the north Pacific walrus population off western Alaska.  The principle focus of this intended order is to use analysis of stable isotope profiles within the first 5 growth layer groups (GLGs) of walrus teeth to estimate weaning age in Pacific walrus.  Four time periods will be compared:  (1) 1962-1972, (2) 1975-1985, (3) 1992-1998, and (4) current/recent times using the most recently available tooth samples. The proposed contract activity consists of two primary tasks: prepare, extract and isolate sample material from the 5 GLGs of each provided sample tooth; and, prepare, conduct, and report the results of carbon (&#61540;13C) and nitrogen (&#61540;15N) stable isotope analysis from each growth layer group (GLG). Proposals are being requested and a written solicitation has been released. The solicitation number G11PS00404 is issued as an RFQ in conjunction with this announcement. This requirement is not set-aside, NAICS Code 541712 size standard 500. Place of performance is contractor facilities, and period of performance is from award through 30 Nov 2012. Interested parties should contact USGS immediately to obtain copies of the subject requirement documents and attachments.  Contract Specialist D. Shannon (916) 278-9342 dshannon@usgs.gov.

OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman.

If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.

If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

<p><br /><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</strong> - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 FAX: 202.475.3904 The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p>12.2.3 The Contractor shall ensure that the dirty rinse water is not allowed to dry on the pavement surface and stain it. If any rinse water stains do occur anywhere on the pavement surface, the Contractor shall clean the pavement until the stain is gone before the end of each work session.</p>
<p>12.2.4 The Contractor shall ensure that his rubber removal process does not discolor or disfigure the pavement surface.</p>
<p>12.2.5 If any rinse water staining or discoloration does occur, the Contractor will be directed to stop work immediately and implement measures to correct the problem.</p>
<p>12.2.6 After each work session is complete, the entire pavement surface must be completely rinsed in accordance with the above requirements even if the Contractor is not yet ready for compliance testing. The Contractor will not be allowed to leave any dust, stains, debris, or dirty rinse water on the pavement surface between work sessions.</p>
<p>13. COMPLIANCE TESTING: Compliance with the 85-percent removal requirement from 100-percent of the work area will be determined by direct testing within the designated work area. The Contractor shall notify the Project Inspector when he is ready for compliance testing. The Contractor and the Project Inspector will then have a meeting to determine the exact testing locations. After the testing locations have been determined, the testing will begin. The government intends to conduct compliance testing within 24 hours after receiving notification from the Contractor. The exact time of the testing will depend on when the runway can be shut down or closed. The Project Inspector will send the compliance report to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>13.1 A one square foot grid with 100 equal squares will be placed on the pavement surface at random, pre-selected locations. The number of squares that contain rubber will then be counted. In order to pass the test, the number of squares containing rubber deposits shall not exceed 15 at each of the selected locations.</p>
<p>13.2 Each work area designated for rubber removal will be divided into four equal zones for the purpose of compliance testing. Within each zone, seven locations will be evaluated. Four of those locations will be located within 15' of the runway centerline. At least six of the locations selected for testing in each zone must meet the requirement specified above. Each zone will be evaluated independently. A zone not meeting the 85-percent removal requirement shall be re-cleaned by the Contractor at his expense.</p>
<p>13.3 Deposits of rubber are defined as any surface deposit that can be removed by digging or scratching the deposit with a pocket knife without damaging the pavement surface. Rubber stain is defined as material in the pavement surface micro texture that cannot be removed without damaging the pavement surface. Rubber stain is generally embedded in the surface of the pavement below the horizontal plane of the surface texture. The Contractor will not be required to remove rubber stain. However, note that rubber stain is different from rinse water stain as defined in Paragraph 12.2.3.</p>
<p>14. CLEANUP: The Contractor shall perform a complete cleanup of the work and equipment storage areas after the work is complete. The Contractor shall ensure that no broom bristles, stains, trash, or any other debris is left behind in these areas. However, the Contractor will not be required to remove the black rubber dust left behind on the surface.</p>
<p>15. BID SCHEDULE: The Contractor shall fill out the bid schedule (see below). The unit of measure shall be measured in Square Yards (SY).

STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW):
The National Park Service is seeking to acquire a Yurt for Capulin Volcano National Monument, NM.
YURT SPECIFICATIONS
1.	Must be 30 ft diameter   2.	Must be an engineered system   3.	Full wind/snow package   4.	Roof and wall insulation package   5.	Taller walls   6.	Dome lifter & tinted dome   7.	Window flaps   8.

The contractor shall furnish all material, labor, equipment and supervision necessary to provide for the construction and installation of a 30 feet yurt on park property.  Yurt is to be installed on existing RV pad at the base of an extinct volcano.  Region is subject to high winds gusting to hurricane strength.  The structure will remain standing year round and should be capable of withstanding extreme temperatures as low as -35 degrees and snow conditions.  The snow amounts reported by the National Weather Service reached a maximum depth of 37 inches on the ground in 2006.  The area has the potential for the Hantavirus; a potentially fatal disease spread by the droppings of certain rodents. While not an imminent danger, engineering measures must be taken to reduce the potential of rodent infestation of the structure.  The park is inhabited by several species of reptile. One, the prairie rattlesnake is venomous. Engineering measures should be taken to prevent the snake from inhabiting the structure.  Additionally, fabric used for exterior walls and roof must comply with National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), Section 101, Chapter11, Paragraph 11.11, Tents as it references fire standards for tents.

<p><strong><br />Purpose:</strong> The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) is seeking information regarding an end-to-end Ka- and Ku- commercial satellite communications (COMSATCOM) capability for Department of Defense theater specific operations.&nbsp; This Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a commitment for an RFP in the future.&nbsp; This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service.&nbsp; Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this announcement.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> COMSATCOM is an essential communications component for in-theater operations.&nbsp; The USCENTCOM theater of operations incurs the greatest amount of COMSATCOM usage, using Ku-band service on more than 20 different commercial communications satellites, mostly through the use of base period leases (typically single-year) with additional option year leases.&nbsp; Leases range from small fractions of a Transponded Equivalent (TPE) to multiple TPEs with an aggregate sustained demand of over 5 GHz of service and more than 1,200 terminal links/accesses.</p>
<p>With the Fiscal Year (FY) 2012 President's Budget Request, the DoD is preparing for an FY12-FY14 investment to acquire long-term satellite communications services in the Ka- and Ku-bands, preferably on a single satellite, to meet COCOM theater demand, directing as many future users and migrating as many existing users as possible from Ku to Ka-band.&nbsp; (Per Appendix A, Ground Tactical demand is envisioned migrating to Ka-band whereas AISR Demand will remain at Ku-band.)&nbsp; The investment includes both the space segment and associated terminals.&nbsp; Initially, the DoD goal is to reduce costs for COMSATCOM capability in the CENTCOM theater of operations.&nbsp; In the future, DoD requires the flexibility of moving these services to other theaters of operation as needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>DoD is evaluating several contracting vehicle options including possible use of the General Services Administration (GSA) Information Technology (IT) Schedule 70 Special Item Number (SIN) 132-54, Commercial Satellite Communications (COMSATCOM) Transponded Capacity, which was established as part of the Future COMSATCOM Services Acquisition (FCSA) to acquire the space segment service.&nbsp; DoD is evaluating several contracting vehicle options for acquiring, or modifying terminals and other necessary user equipment including possible use of GSA IT Schedule 70 SIN 132-3, 132-4, 132-8, and/or 132-9; the new GSA Custom SATCOM Solutions (CS2) and CS2 - Small Business ID/IQ contracts scheduled to be available by 4th Quarter FY2011; or another existing DoD contract focused on terminals and user equipment.</p>
<p><strong>[Note that Schedule 70 has an open enrollment provision, allowing interested vendors to apply at any time.&nbsp; The timeline to receive a Schedule 70 contract is typically four (4) months from submission of a complete proposal.&nbsp; Please see www.gsa.gov/schedule70 and www.gsa.gov/fcsa for further details.]&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The budgeted cost for the service is $440 million to include service operations and initial terminal modifications and replacements to use the space segment service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>DoD is seeking the following capabilities from this COMSATCOM service:&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Primary services supported at Ka frequencies (20.2-21.2 GHz on the downlink, 30.0-31.0 GHz on the uplink). The DoD will consider all industry solutions for securing orbital and frequency authorization and will assist with any approach deemed feasible based upon US domestic and international regulatory requirements. Industry would be solely responsible for obtaining licensing and orbital allocation using their normal process.<br /><br />-At least enough space resources to meet the current commercial SATCOM demand described in Appendix A. The objective is double demand documented in Appendix A with theater area beams.</p>
<p>-Service is available for use starting no later than 31 December 2014.</p>
<p>-Ability to support multiple changes to the theater of operation for the service over the lifetime of the lease.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Appendix A contains a summary of the current commercial SATCOM demand characteristics that make up the current Ku-band leases (Scenario #1). In addition, data is also provided about the currently deployed in-theater terminal population accessing these COMSATCOM services. An alternative scenario (Scenario #2) is also described to assess system extensibility.</p>
<p>Information Requested: The following questions are intended to help structure the acquisition of the stated COMSATCOM capability, including space segment service and terminals. Questions are intended to enable DoD to refine its strategy for this commercial SATCOM capability.</p>
<p><strong>Proprietary information or trade secrets should be clearly identified. All information received that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Technical<br />T1.</strong>What Ka-band and Ku-band services do you already have planned (or could provide) by the service start date? What is the design and on-orbit pedigree of the capability? What is the expected design and operating life?<br /><strong>T2.</strong>Assuming that the services you provide are initially to support the user population in Appendix A, Scenario 1, but later the services must be moved to another theater to support the user population shown in Appendix A, Scenario 2, what percentage of each Scenario's requirements do you estimate could be met with such a system or service? <br /><strong>T3.</strong>Describe the coverage, polarization, and bandwidth assignments of your proposed solution. Can the 30.0-31.0 GHz up / 20.2-21.2 GHz down gateway links be steerable? If so, how many can be supported? <br /><strong>T4.</strong>To what extent can some or all of the theatre Ka- and Ku-band coverages be steered to facilitate optimized service after repositioning? Can that Ka-band coverage be segmented and steered independently? <br /><strong>T5.</strong>What are the satellite station keeping requirements to achieve the forecasted performance of your solution?<br /><strong>T6.</strong>What terrestrial infrastructure (terminals, gateways, DoD gateways, network operations center (NOCs), hubs, terrestrial connectivity) is required to deliver your projected performance? Please include details on number of gateways required, number of terminals, connectivity, topology, terminal technical characteristics, polarization, use of multiple frequency bands to terminate user links, etc.)? Specify any assumptions you make.<br /><strong>T7.</strong>Describe the interoperability of your service with planned DoD military Ka-band systems (e.g., terminals that meet MIL-STD-188-164 and modems that meet MIL-STD-188-165.) To what extent would the performance discussed in T1 change if you were to rely exclusively on planned DoD Ka-band terminals and the planned modem inventory? (The WGS terminal population predominantly operates RHCP on the uplink and LHCP on the downlink with an axial ratio of &lt; 2dB. Select coverage areas on the WGS satellite are also capable of operating LHCP on the uplink and RHCP on the downlink, non-simultaneously. Select DoD Ka-band terminal types are capable of operating LHCP on the uplink and RHCP on the downlink, again, non-simultaneously.)<br /><strong>T8.</strong>Describe the major components of the system and service (e.g., satellite, gateways, terminals, modems, hubs, NOCs)? Describe the assumptions and function of each component and the extent to which forecasted performance is dependent on each component's characteristics to achieve the system performance forecast. <br /><strong>T9.</strong>Using the information in Appendix A, specify any user equipment changes needed. Include the estimated number of terminals that will need to be replaced. For new and replacement terminals, provide size, weight, and power demands of the equipment and any ruggedized characteristics of the equipment. To what extent does the performance of your solution require homogeneous terminal sizes/performance? What are the practical limits on diverse terminal sizes on your solution? To what extend is the performance of your solution dependent upon a specified connectivity type (e.g., hub-spoke only)? What is the impact to the performance if the service must support hub-spoke, point-to-point, and mesh connectivity.<br /><strong>T10.</strong>What terminals, modems, and network equipment are available that provide end-to-end service for your solution? From what sources can this equipment and terminals be procured?<br /><strong>T11.</strong>Describe the operations and control plan for your service including the location of the control facilities. Describe the process for a user to request and obtain service. Describe the security features that could be made available from that control facility. What tools would be necessary for the Government to provide payload configuration direction? Are those tools included in your solution and price estimates? Describe the functions and staffing of any NOC used for operations of comparable commercial systems.<br /><strong>T12.</strong>What are the information assurance features or characteristics of your service (e.g., TT&amp;C link encryption, network controls)? How compliant is it with the MAC I IA controls specified for GSA IT Schedule 70 SIN 132-54? (See Appendix B).<br /><strong>T13.</strong>Is your service capable of meeting the "Terms and Conditions Applicable to <br />Commercial Satellite Communications (COMSATCOM) Transponded Capacity (Special Item Number 132-54)"? (See 08_Proposal Price List Preparation document within Schedule 70 solicitation - http://www.gsa.gov/schedule70.) <br /><strong>T14.</strong>Describe your plan, including any steps requiring DoD activity, for gaining orbital slot approval for the space segment. What are the regulatory considerations and what is their impact on schedule? Cost considerations?</p>
<p><strong>Funding/ Contracting Mechanisms<br />F1.</strong>Provide a ROM total cost and the percentage for each cost element for your proposed solution.<br /><strong>F2.</strong>What are your standard payment practices for your proposed service? Are there specific payment models that you would recommend? Are there constraints should payment not occur until service delivery?<br /><strong>F3.</strong>What are your standard service agreements for leases of this duration? What arrangements do you enter into with commercial customers to provide them the assurance that you will deliver the service over the entire lease assuming full payment occurs no later than 2018?<br /><strong>F4.</strong>Assuming the last increment of funding is dispersed after successful service activation and the contractor will provide satellite operations for a period beyond that date, how does the Government ensure its service level agreement over that period between last payment and service end date is met (e.g., a liquidated damages clause (i.e., Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.211-11))? If so, what would be the possible terms and structure of such a liquidated damages clause?<br /><strong>F5.</strong>The Government is exploring the use of GSA IT Schedule 70 SIN 132-54 for acquiring space segment services. For the associated terminals, please describe your preferred contracting mechanism - GSA IT Schedule 70, or the CS2 and CS2 - Small Business ID/IQ contracts, or another existing DoD contract - for terminal leasing, procurement or modification and installation. From what other contracts or sources can these terminals be procured?<br /><br /><strong>Schedule<br />S1.</strong>The desired date from service activation is 31 December 2014; describe your plan to meet this schedule. What is the necessary contract award date to accomplish this? Ensure service test and checkout prior to Government acceptance of the service is included in your schedule.<br /><strong>S2.</strong>Describe the timeline for terminal and user equipment contract award to delivery and installation of equipment.</p>

<p>DoD is evaluating several contracting vehicle options including possible use of the General Services Administration (GSA) Information Technology (IT) Schedule 70 Special Item Number (SIN) 132-54, Commercial Satellite Communications (COMSATCOM) Transponded Capacity, which was established as part of the Future COMSATCOM Services Acquisition (FCSA) to acquire the space segment service.&nbsp; DoD is evaluating several contracting vehicle options for acquiring, or modifying terminals and other necessary user equipment including possible use of GSA IT Schedule 70 SIN 132-3, 132-4, 132-8, and/or 132-9; the new GSA Custom SATCOM Solutions (CS2) and CS2 - Small Business ID/IQ contracts scheduled to be available by 4th Quarter FY2011; or another existing DoD contract focused on terminals and user equipment.</p>
<p><strong>[Note that Schedule 70 has an open enrollment provision, allowing interested vendors to apply at any time.&nbsp; The timeline to receive a Schedule 70 contract is typically four (4) months from submission of a complete proposal.&nbsp; Please see www.gsa.gov/schedule70 and www.gsa.gov/fcsa for further details.]&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The budgeted cost for the service is $440 million to include service operations and initial terminal modifications and replacements to use the space segment service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>DoD is seeking the following capabilities from this COMSATCOM service:&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Primary services supported at Ka frequencies (20.2-21.2 GHz on the downlink, 30.0-31.0 GHz on the uplink). The DoD will consider all industry solutions for securing orbital and frequency authorization and will assist with any approach deemed feasible based upon US domestic and international regulatory requirements. Industry would be solely responsible for obtaining licensing and orbital allocation using their normal process.<br /><br />-At least enough space resources to meet the current commercial SATCOM demand described in Appendix A. The objective is double demand documented in Appendix A with theater area beams.</p>
<p>-Service is available for use starting no later than 31 December 2014.</p>
<p>-Ability to support multiple changes to the theater of operation for the service over the lifetime of the lease.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Appendix A contains a summary of the current commercial SATCOM demand characteristics that make up the current Ku-band leases (Scenario #1). In addition, data is also provided about the currently deployed in-theater terminal population accessing these COMSATCOM services. An alternative scenario (Scenario #2) is also described to assess system extensibility.</p>
<p>Information Requested: The following questions are intended to help structure the acquisition of the stated COMSATCOM capability, including space segment service and terminals. Questions are intended to enable DoD to refine its strategy for this commercial SATCOM capability.</p>
<p><strong>Proprietary information or trade secrets should be clearly identified. All information received that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Technical<br />T1.</strong>What Ka-band and Ku-band services do you already have planned (or could provide) by the service start date? What is the design and on-orbit pedigree of the capability? What is the expected design and operating life?<br /><strong>T2.</strong>Assuming that the services you provide are initially to support the user population in Appendix A, Scenario 1, but later the services must be moved to another theater to support the user population shown in Appendix A, Scenario 2, what percentage of each Scenario's requirements do you estimate could be met with such a system or service? <br /><strong>T3.</strong>Describe the coverage, polarization, and bandwidth assignments of your proposed solution. Can the 30.0-31.0 GHz up / 20.2-21.2 GHz down gateway links be steerable? If so, how many can be supported? <br /><strong>T4.</strong>To what extent can some or all of the theatre Ka- and Ku-band coverages be steered to facilitate optimized service after repositioning? Can that Ka-band coverage be segmented and steered independently? <br /><strong>T5.</strong>What are the satellite station keeping requirements to achieve the forecasted performance of your solution?<br /><strong>T6.</strong>What terrestrial infrastructure (terminals, gateways, DoD gateways, network operations center (NOCs), hubs, terrestrial connectivity) is required to deliver your projected performance? Please include details on number of gateways required, number of terminals, connectivity, topology, terminal technical characteristics, polarization, use of multiple frequency bands to terminate user links, etc.)? Specify any assumptions you make.<br /><strong>T7.</strong>Describe the interoperability of your service with planned DoD military Ka-band systems (e.g., terminals that meet MIL-STD-188-164 and modems that meet MIL-STD-188-165.) To what extent would the performance discussed in T1 change if you were to rely exclusively on planned DoD Ka-band terminals and the planned modem inventory? (The WGS terminal population predominantly operates RHCP on the uplink and LHCP on the downlink with an axial ratio of &lt; 2dB. Select coverage areas on the WGS satellite are also capable of operating LHCP on the uplink and RHCP on the downlink, non-simultaneously. Select DoD Ka-band terminal types are capable of operating LHCP on the uplink and RHCP on the downlink, again, non-simultaneously.)<br /><strong>T8.</strong>Describe the major components of the system and service (e.g., satellite, gateways, terminals, modems, hubs, NOCs)? Describe the assumptions and function of each component and the extent to which forecasted performance is dependent on each component's characteristics to achieve the system performance forecast. <br /><strong>T9.</strong>Using the information in Appendix A, specify any user equipment changes needed. Include the estimated number of terminals that will need to be replaced. For new and replacement terminals, provide size, weight, and power demands of the equipment and any ruggedized characteristics of the equipment. To what extent does the performance of your solution require homogeneous terminal sizes/performance? What are the practical limits on diverse terminal sizes on your solution? To what extend is the performance of your solution dependent upon a specified connectivity type (e.g., hub-spoke only)? What is the impact to the performance if the service must support hub-spoke, point-to-point, and mesh connectivity.<br /><strong>T10.</strong>What terminals, modems, and network equipment are available that provide end-to-end service for your solution? From what sources can this equipment and terminals be procured?<br /><strong>T11.</strong>Describe the operations and control plan for your service including the location of the control facilities. Describe the process for a user to request and obtain service. Describe the security features that could be made available from that control facility. What tools would be necessary for the Government to provide payload configuration direction? Are those tools included in your solution and price estimates?

How compliant is it with the MAC I IA controls specified for GSA IT Schedule 70 SIN 132-54? (See Appendix B).<br /><strong>T13.</strong>Is your service capable of meeting the "Terms and Conditions Applicable to <br />Commercial Satellite Communications (COMSATCOM) Transponded Capacity (Special Item Number 132-54)"? (See 08_Proposal Price List Preparation document within Schedule 70 solicitation - http://www.gsa.gov/schedule70.) <br /><strong>T14.</strong>Describe your plan, including any steps requiring DoD activity, for gaining orbital slot approval for the space segment. What are the regulatory considerations and what is their impact on schedule? Cost considerations?</p>
<p><strong>Funding/ Contracting Mechanisms<br />F1.</strong>Provide a ROM total cost and the percentage for each cost element for your proposed solution.<br /><strong>F2.</strong>What are your standard payment practices for your proposed service? Are there specific payment models that you would recommend? Are there constraints should payment not occur until service delivery?<br /><strong>F3.</strong>What are your standard service agreements for leases of this duration? What arrangements do you enter into with commercial customers to provide them the assurance that you will deliver the service over the entire lease assuming full payment occurs no later than 2018?<br /><strong>F4.</strong>Assuming the last increment of funding is dispersed after successful service activation and the contractor will provide satellite operations for a period beyond that date, how does the Government ensure its service level agreement over that period between last payment and service end date is met (e.g., a liquidated damages clause (i.e., Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.211-11))? If so, what would be the possible terms and structure of such a liquidated damages clause?<br /><strong>F5.</strong>The Government is exploring the use of GSA IT Schedule 70 SIN 132-54 for acquiring space segment services. For the associated terminals, please describe your preferred contracting mechanism - GSA IT Schedule 70, or the CS2 and CS2 - Small Business ID/IQ contracts, or another existing DoD contract - for terminal leasing, procurement or modification and installation. From what other contracts or sources can these terminals be procured?<br /><br /><strong>Schedule<br />S1.</strong>The desired date from service activation is 31 December 2014; describe your plan to meet this schedule. What is the necessary contract award date to accomplish this? Ensure service test and checkout prior to Government acceptance of the service is included in your schedule.<br /><strong>S2.</strong>Describe the timeline for terminal and user equipment contract award to delivery and installation of equipment.</p>

<DESC>Instructions to Offerors
<p>1. Attachments 1-6 have been updated . Ensure you are using v10.1 documents to prepare your proposal. <br /><br />2. The v10.1 documents are written as they pertain to the current TACLAN contract. There are areas that will change based on the fact that the current contract is not associated with the Special Operations Forces Informstion Technology Enterprise Contracts (SITEC). The new TACLAN contractor will interface with other SITEC IT Service Area providers . The Tier 1 and Tier 2 help desk functions will be accomplished by contractors in other towers. The TACLAN contractor will be responsible for Tier 3 maintenance. V10.1 documents will need to be updated to reflect any and all changes based on the SITEC/TACLAN relationship. <br /><br />3. An Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) Assessment was conducted to determine if the current TACLAN contractor, iGov, has an unfair competitive advantage or impaired objectivity. Based on the analysis performed, it is my opinion that iGov does not have an OCI that would prevent it from competing on the TACLAN procurement. The Government will re-examine this issue if questions are raised by other offerors.</p>
