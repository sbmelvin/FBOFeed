<DESC>Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) Number:  E14PS00019 for Proposed Research on Arctic Safety of Oil and Gas Operations in the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf
The U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) solicits White Papers of not more than five (5) pages in length, for specific areas of interest to the BSEE Technology Assessment Program (TAP) on Arctic Safety of Oil and Gas Operations in the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf.  When appropriate, the research shall be conducted consistently with prior research.  For a summary of research previously completed and recently performed, visit http://www.bsee.gov/Research-and-Training/Technology-Assessment-and-Research/. Interested parties are encouraged to view the information presented on the site when considering submitting white papers.
BACKGROUND:   The BSEE TAP Program is requesting white papers to be submitted in accordance with the terms of this announcement.  Selected white papers will be requested to submit proposals.  NOTICE:  The BSEE may share the White Papers with other organizations for review.  Potential contractors shall notify the BSEE if they do not want their White Papers/proposals shared outside of BSEE.  BSEE anticipates multiple awards resultant to this announcement will be made on a Firm Fixed-Price (FFP) basis. 
OBJECTIVES:  The topics for the FY 2014 Arctic Safety research funding should be limited to the following topics:  
1.  Ice Forecasting and Monitoring: During Arctic exploratory drilling operations activities are generally limited to the summer open water season.  It therefore becomes necessary to accurately forecast the dates at which operators can safely begin and the dates at which they must cease operations and leave the Arctic.  The proposed ice forecasting research is needed to allow BSEE to effectively judge the adequacy of the estimated times in industry proposals and to apply adaptive regulatory techniques to these operations.  The monitoring portion of this research is necessary to facilitate BSEE oversight of ice management plans and the times necessary to evacuate locations over which multi-season ice will pass. 
2.  Ice Scour and Gouging Effects with Respect to Pipeline and Wellhead Placement and Design:  Due to the relatively shallow water in active Arctic prospects and the presence of mobile multi-year ice at these locations, BSEE needs to evaluate the threat of ice gouging on subsea equipment and the locations of potential scour and gouging.  Currently, there is no effective means of judging the age of ice furrows and to predict the probability of future occurrences.   There is also a need to know the potential depth of such furrows and the extent of the precautions necessary to prevent damage to the wellhead and pipelines. 
3.  Low Temperature Effects on Drilling Equipment (seals, lubricants, embrittlement): There is a need to evaluate existing low-temperature drilling techniques and equipment used onshore in other parts of the world to help assess the feasibility of using such equipment and technology offshore in the Arctic.  This evaluation will include an analysis of the exposure of subsea equipment to very low surface temperatures and a determination of which lubricants and sealing materials are effective for Arctic.  Consideration will also be given to what equipment should be de-rated for use on low temperature Arctic environments. 
4.  Design Criteria for Arctic Offshore Drilling and Production Structures and Pipelines:  There will soon be a need for BSEE to evaluate industry proposals for drilling and production structures for use in developing offshore Arctic resources.  As such, BSEE needs to be well versed in the potential impacts of ice loading for year-round installations and the design criteria necessary to safely operate in this environment.  There is also a need to investigate the requirements of subsea pipelines in the Arctic and the effect ice forces, ice gouging and permafrost have on pipeline design and placement. 
HOW TO RESPOND:  White Papers of not more than five (5) pages in length, an ORIGINAL PLUS three (3) copies and one (1) electronic copy in PDF format, on a CD, shall be submitted to the U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, Acquisition Operations Branch, 381 Elden St., Herndon, VA 20170-4879, ATTN: Christy Tardiff, not later than 3:00 PM, Eastern Time on February 10, 2014.  WHITE PAPERS SENT THROUGH EMAIL AND FAXES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.  White Papers shall define the proposed research scope and include the level of effort.  NOTE THAT COST ESTIMATES ARE NOT TO BE INCLUDED IN THE WHITE PAPER.  The White Papers shall be evaluated only on technical merits.  IF YOUR WHITE PAPER IS SELECTED FOR FURTHER EVALUATION, A TECHNICAL AND COST/BUSINESS PROPOSAL WILL BE REQUESTED FROM YOUR COMPANY BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER.  Projects shall be selected from all or part of the technical issues listed depending on the interest and scope of White Papers received.  BSEE shall evaluate the responses, and those deemed to have merit shall be furnished information to assist in the preparation of the complete proposal.  This announcement constitutes a Request for White Papers, but does not obligate the Government to consummate award.  Respondents WILL NOT be notified of the results of the evaluation on the information submitted. 
WHITE PAPERS SHALL BE EVALUATED USING THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA: (1) feasibility of the approach or solution; (2) the Offerors understanding of the technical issues; (3) the Offerors ability to implement the proposed approach; (4) innovative or creative approaches or solutions including the participation and/or funding by the oil and gas industry or other groups in the research industry, where appropriate; and (5) past performance.  IF ANY OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT ARE NOT MET, THE WHITE PAPER WILL NOT BE EVALUATED.  Questions shall be E-mailed to the Contracting Officer, Christy.Tardiff@bsee.gov not later than 3:00 PM, Eastern Time on January 22, 2014.  The Solicitation number E14PS00019 MUST be in the subject line of the E-mail.  All questions shall include the Solicitation number E14PS00019, your full name and title, your organization, complete address, and telephone and fax numbers.  Telephone inquiries WILL NOT be accepted.  A separate White Paper shall be submitted for each topic/study on which the offeror wishes to propose.  The White Paper shall identify clearly the Offerors company/organization, point of contact, address, telephone and facsimile numbers.  If Offerors desire to hand deliver their White Papers, they are advised that the BSEE facility is a secure office complex and Offerors MUST NOT enter the building beyond the lobby.  There is a courtesy telephone at the guard station to which you must call extension 71367 for a procurement official to meet and receive your submittal.

<a href="mailto:rosalia.toberman-1@nasa.gov">Rosalia  Toberman</EMAIL></a>
<DESC>NASA/DFRC has identified an over & above (O&A) requirement to remove and replace various corroded engine outlet guide vanes; and blend additional compressor section blades on the four (4) each Pratt & Whitney JT9D-7J Shuttle Carrier Aircraft (SCA) engines (S/Ns: 662413, 625798, 662478, and 662935) currently undergoing teardown, evaluation, and repair under contract NND13AD21P.  Completion of the O&A requirement(s) are required in-order to recertify the airworthiness of the engines to be utilized as spares for the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) Program.  The original contract inadvertently did not address the O&A requirement(s) at the time of award. NASA/DFRC intends to purchase the O&A services directly from Aircraft Demolition, LLC/Pulsar Aviation as they are the Contractor currently performing the teardown, evaluation, and repair of the engines for NASA DFRC.  Authority for the requirement is 10 USC 2304(c) (1) and FAR 6.302-1 (a) (2)  Only one responsible source.	Justification is based upon the following facts: 1.	Aircraft Demolition, LLC/Pulsar Aviation was competitively awarded the contract to perform the teardown, evaluation, and engine repair services under contract NND13AD21P.  The to-be-determined (TBD) O&A requirement was known at the time of award (and considered to be within the General scope of work) but was inadvertently excluded from the contract schedule at the time of award. 2.	Aircraft Demolition, LLC/Pulsar Aviation is in the middle of completing the teardown, evaluation, and repair on the aircraft engines.  Recompeting the engine assessment (including the O&A requirement) at this stage of the procurement cycle would be impractical as this would delay completion of the current work and require substantial additional time and cost not expected to be recovered through competition.  Based upon the above, utilization of any other service provider in-lieu of Aircraft Demolition, LLC/Pulsar Aviation for these services would likely result in: a) substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition; and b) unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirements.  These reasons justify procuring the required services exclusively from Aircraft Demolition, LLC/Pulsar Aviation. &lt;p&gt; The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.   &lt;p&gt; Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on ___01/16/2014______. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. &lt;p&gt; Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. &lt;p&gt; All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. &lt;p&gt; NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html	  . &lt;p&gt;

<p>This notice is issued on behalf of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), Office of Acquisitions, NIH, DHHS. This is a Pre-solicitation Notice in advance of the Request for Proposals (RFP). The Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement. The RFP, NIH-NIAAA-2014-02, detailing the specifics of the project, as well as information pertinent to the development of an Offeror's proposal, will be available electronically within 14 calendar days of this notice and may be accessed through the Internet on the Federal Business Opportunities website: http://www.fedbizopps.gov. No paper solicitation is available. Potential Offerors are responsible for downloading the solicitation and for routinely checking the site for any solicitation amendments issued by the Government. Proposals will be due on or about March 12, 2014. It is anticipated that one cost-reimbursement contract award will be made for a period of five years (i.e. one 12-month base period plus four 12-month options) beginning on or about July 1, 2014.</p>
<p>This is a Research and Development contract initiative entitled Preclinical Medications Screening in Dependence Models. This is not an NIH grant opportunity. The NIAAA seeks a contractor to address the present and anticipated future needs of NIAAA's Medications Development Program. The Division of Neuroscience and Behavior's (DNB) Preclinical Medication Efficacy Testing Program seeks to re-compete a contract for the blind testing of reference compounds and proprietary compounds on alcohol drinking in mice using models of various aspects of alcohol dependence. The contract will use mechanisms having intellectual property conditions favorable to compound providers. This will eliminate a major barrier to testing optimized compounds having preclinical, as well as clinical toxicology data, and will stimulate interest by the pharmaceutical industry in developing high quality, marketable compounds for alcoholism. Overall, the contractor will assess effects of proprietary compounds in standardized models of alcohol dependence-induced alcohol intake using mice for subjects. Specifically, the contractor will be required to test effects of compounds submitted to them by NIAAA staff members in voluntary limited-access 2 bottle choice drinking of unsweetened ethanol solutions in mice made dependent through repeated cycles of ethanol vapor exposure and withdrawal. The contractor will also develop and implement testing of proprietary compounds in additional mouse models, which may include drinking in the dark (DID), intermittent access drinking model, alcohol deprivation model (ADE), and conditioned place preference (CPP) models. The contractor will also collect, analyze and display data from these tests and report them to designated NIAAA personnel. The data generated by this contract will be used in the identification of compounds for further development. All qualified organizations are encouraged to respond with a contract proposal.</p>

<RESPDATE>043013
<CONTACT>Mercedes Burrell 202-781-1843 David Diamantopoulos 202-781-2847
<DESC>The Naval Sea System Command (NAVSEA) intends to issue a Full and Open Competitive solicitation for the production of a modernized TB-34 Towed Body (TB-34) to include TB-34 Towed Array Assemblies and electro-optical Light Weight Tow Cable (LWTC) under a performance specification. This requirement also includes Engineering Services and Provisional Item Orders.  The resultant contract will include one (1) base year and four (4) option years.

The TB-34 will be the newest Fat Line Towed Array, housed inside the nominally 280 foot long stowage tube located outboard on submarine hulls. This array must provide high reliability, achieved by lower power requirements and reduced complexity.  Additionally, enhanced Performance Monitoring/Fault Localization capability, embedded within the array structure, is needed to assist in onboard troubleshooting when at sea, and ultimately, allow for prediction of failures prior to arrays being installed on submarines.
  

The TB-34 array will use an LWTC to enable the bandwidth required to be sent from the array to the submarine.  In addition, wide-band sensors will be included in the aft end of the array to detect and provide directional information on very high frequencies of interest.  The LWTC will permit increased scope towing in littoral regions as compared to Heavy Weight Tow Cables. The LWTC will be fully capable of withstanding buckling imparted by the OK-276 handling system as well as compressive loads exerted by the flusher/snubber unit. 

The TB-34s acoustic capability will be processed by the AN/BQQ-10 host sonar system.  This processing can not only utilize the array as a stand-alone sensor, but will also be able to process the array in conjunction with hull mounted sensors that are now acoustically overlapped by the TB-34 array, contributing towards the continuing efforts to preserve SSN acoustic superiority.

This RFP and related files listed under solicitation number N00024-13-R-6262 will be issued electronically.
  The RFP is expected to be issued prior to the end of April 2013.  The RFP is expected to include a first article Cost-Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) in the base period with Full Rate Production (FRP) units being procured on a Cost-Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF) basis in option 1, and with FRP units being procured on a Fixed Price Incentive (FPI) basis in option years 2-4.  A total 40 production units are expected to be included in the RFP and priced via a stepladder pricing format.  NAVSEA is contemplating the prospect of conducting an Industry Day session prior to the release of the RFP.  In the event that an industry day is scheduled, associated information will be provided via an amendment to this synopsis.

<p><span style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9.5pt">The Naval Sea System Command (NAVSEA) intends to issue a Full and Open Competitive solicitation for the production of a modernized TB-34 Towed Body (TB-34) to include TB-34 Towed Array Assemblies and electro-optical Light Weight Tow Cable (LWTC) under a performance specification. This requirement also includes Engineering Services and Provisional Item Orders. The resultant contract will include one (1) base year and four (4) option years. The TB-34 will be the newest Fat Line Towed Array, housed inside the nominally 280 foot long stowage tube located outboard on submarine hulls. This array must provide high reliability, achieved by lower power requirements and reduced complexity. Additionally, enhanced Performance Monitoring/Fault Localization capability, embedded within the array structure, is needed to assist in onboard troubleshooting when at sea, and ultimately, allow for prediction of failures prior to arrays being installed on submarines. The TB-34 array will use an LWTC to enable the bandwidth required to be sent from the array to the submarine. In addition, wide-band sensors will be included in the aft end of the array to detect and provide directional information on very high frequencies of interest.

<DESC><p><strong>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL</strong></p>
<p>MASTER PLAN within NATIONAL HISTORIC LANDMARK SITE; GSA Design Excellence Solicitation for Lead Planning, Architecture, and Engineering Services (PAE); SOLICITATION: GS11P13MKC0029; REGION: National Capital Region, Washington, DC.; CONTRACTING OFFICER: Mary E. Pineda, (202) 205-8468; CONTRACTING SPECIALIST: Nick Carroll, (202) 205- 0757; PROJECT TYPE:&nbsp; Master Plan (including a Campus Development Plan, Environmental Impact Statement, Cultural Resources Evaluation, and Transportation Management Plan); BUILDING TYPE:&nbsp;Adaptive reuse and new construction within a national historic landmark site; CLIENT AGENCY: U.S. Department of State; BUDGET:&nbsp; The total cost should range between $1,500,000 to $2,000,000; GEOGRAPHIC LIMITATION:&nbsp; Nationwide, THIS PROCUREMENT IS OPEN TO SMALL AND LARGE BUSINESS (SEE SUBCONTRACTING REQUIREMENTS UNDER STAGE II HEREIN)</p>
<p>The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), in partnership with the U.S. Department of State (DOS) announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in Master Planning for the Potomac Hill Diplomatic Center (PHDC), a historic federal campus in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood of downtown Washington, DC. This solicitation represents Stage I of a two-stage Design Excellence Program solicitation process.</p>
<p>GSA's Design Excellence Program was instituted to secure top-quality design talent and has led to the development of exceptional achievements in federal workspace development throughout the nation. The program stresses creativity. It also streamlines the way GSA hires Planning, Architecture, and Engineering (PAE) Firms, substantially cutting the cost of competing for GSA contracts.</p>
<p>The Design Excellence Program operates through GSA's Public Buildings Service (PBS). PBS directs the federal government's multibillion-dollar building program, which includes construction, renovation, alteration, and repair of federal office buildings, courthouses, and other facilities. Most of GSA's work is in partnership with PAE groups from the private sector.</p>
<p><strong>PROJECT DESCRIPTION: <br /></strong>The scope of work for PHDC Master Plan requires, at minimum, the successful completion (including regulatory agency approval) of all components required for a multiple scenario Campus Development Plan; Cultural Resources Evaluation (pursuant to Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act); Environmental Impact Statement (pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act); and Transportation Management Plan (pursuant to the policies of the National Capital Planning Commission). The plan is also to include GSA and DOS design standards for secure facilities. The contract will range in value from $1,500,000 to $2,000,000.</p>
<p>PHDC is located at 2300 E Street, NW, Washington, DC 20037. The site consists of two adjoining federally owned parcels, the Navy Hill and Potomac Annex properties (NOTE: Site Drawing attached herein under&nbsp;ATTACHMENT A - SITE DRAWING). Together, these properties compose a single, 11.8-acre campus that was deeded to the federal government in the 1790s. The site is home to the first Naval Observatory and the original headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency. Mid-19th and early 20th Century buildings populate the campus today, which is bound by 23rd Street, NW to the east; the U.S. Institute of Peace property to the south; and the E Street, NW off ramp of the E Street Expressway to the west and north.</p>
<p>With DOS headquarters (2201 C Street, NW) and the U.S. Institute of Peace (2301 Constitution Avenue, NW) immediately adjacent to the site, and DOS'sneed for additional federally owned office space, GSA is currently working with DOS to transform the Potomac Annex and Navy Hill properties into a single, state-of-the-art federal campus, where history meets innovation and modernization. The campus is envisioned to serve the long-term needs of DOS and minimize the agency's real estate expenses by transitioning employees now housed in private office buildings to this federally owned site. The exact number of employees to relocate will depend on the development potential of PHDC as determined through the planning process. Therefore, a major objective of this project will be to develop a Master Plan that maximizes the full development potential of the site while meeting all regulatory obligations and Design Excellence Program standards.</p>
<p>There are eight existing office buildings located throughout the campus (three currently occupied by DOS and five vacant that are now undergoing renovation) and portions of open space that may be suitable for future development. The PHDC Master Plan will address the needs of GSA and DOS through phased development of PHDC and will turn upon such items as usable land areas, appropriate densities, highest and best use, and cultural, environmental, transportation, and regulatory constraints.</p>
<p>The PHDC Master Plan will lay the foundation for the development of a world-class federal campus that preserves the cultural legacy of the site and responds to the development needs of the Government in the modern era and beyond. The campus should complement and contribute to surrounding public and private land uses and bring unity to the federal presence in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>PHDC is listed on the District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites and is eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district. The original Naval Observatory is already designated a National Historic Landmark. <br /><br /><strong>Scope of Services Overview<br /></strong>In general terms, the scope of services will include:</p>

<p>Background</p>
<p>The T-1A is a Commercial Derivative Aircraft of the Hawker Beechcraft 400A (Jayhawk) and is FAR Part 25 certified (Type Certificate Data Sheet A16SW). The aircraft is used to train Air Force Pilots and Combat Systems Officers (CSO). The USAF has 178 active T-1A aircraft at the following bases: Vance AFB, Randolph AFB, Laughlin AFB, Columbus AFB and NAS Pensacola. 21 aircraft have been designated as CSO training aircraft and have been modified to meet mission requirements.. The T-1A is supported by 16 simulators, which are stationed at each base.</p>
<p>Description:</p>
<p>The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 336413, size standard 1,000 employees. Major logistics elements will address, but are not limited to, provide solutions to sustain the T-1A through CY2035. Solutions should address, at a minimum; obsolete cockpit avionics, rough order of magnitude pricing and delivery schedule/capabilities. All aircraft modifications will require Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification at a part 145 repair station.</p>
<p>Avionics:</p>
<p>The T-1A currently utilizes a ProLine 2/4 avionics suite which is experiencing obsolescence in no less than three known systems. The USG is conducting market research to interface the aircraft with a modern avionics suite replacement to maintain current capabilities and ensure flight operations at all times, in all civil and military airspace (National Airspace System [NAS]). The T-1A currently utilizes the ARINC 429 data bus and the Collins APS-85 autopilot. The solution must mitigate/eliminate DMSMS issues throughout the projected service life of CY2035.</p>
<p><br />Minimum avionics capability required:</p>
<p>a. GPS<br />b. Dual EFIS<br />c. 3-axis autopilot with coupled approach capability<br />d. Dual Independent Flight Directors (integrated with auto pilot)<br />e. Transponder <br />f. Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System II<br />g. Radar Altimeter<br />h. Digital 24-hr Clock (pilot/co-pilot)<br />i. WX Radar (color)<br />j. Flight Management System capability <br />k. Dual radios (VHF and UHF)<br />l. VOR / ILS<br />m. TACAN <br />n. DME<br />o. ADF<br />p. Rendezvous Training Equipment (air-to-air TACAN used in current aircraft configuration)<br />q. Ground Proximity Warning System <br />r. ADS-B out (1090 ES)<br />s. Stand-by Instrumentation (Attitude, Altimeter, Airspeed, and Magnetic Compass)<br />t. Accelerometer<br />u. Angle of Attack Indication/Display<br />v. Intercom (all crew locations)<br />w. Crash Survivable Flight Data Recorder (CSFDR) (maintain current system)</p>
<p><br />Current and near term obsolescence issues:</p>
<p>Model Description</p>
<p>a. MFD-871T Multifunction Display<br />b. AHC-85E Attitude Heading Computer<br />c. ALT-55B Radio Altimeter<br />d. ALI-55 Radio Altimeter Indicator<br />e. TTR-920 TCAS Computer<br />f. RTU-870T Radio Tuning Unit<br />g. TDR-94D Transponder Set - Mode S<br />h. DAU-650 Data Acquisition Unit<br />i. DAU-651 Data Acquisition Unit<br />j. FDU-70 Flux Detector</p>
<p><br />Services Questions:<br />1.) Identify if you are a small or large business <br />2.) What teaming arrangements, if any, do you anticipate would be established for this modification?<br />3.) Can your company/team provide a complete avionics upgrade to include FAA certification on the T-1A? <br />4.) How many prototypes will you require for certification?<br />5.) How long do you anticipate the modification and certification to take?<br />6.) What is your proposed aircraft throughput per month/year for accomplishing modification of the 178 aircraft fleet? <br />7.) Can you provide solutions for the 16 simulators in order to maintain current configuration?<br />8.) What is included in your baseline avionics package and what items are considered options? <br />9.) Do you anticipate any problems associated with integration and the wiring harnesses on this aging aircraft?<br />10.) Has your company performed avionics suite replacements on other similar airframes?<br />11.) Do you have published Reliability, Availability, and Maintainability standards for the individual avionics suite components?<br />Potential Industry Day:<br />The government may conduct an industry day to field questions from potential sources which provide a relevant CDP. The receipt of the CDP is to be considered a request to attend the Industry Day, if the USG determines it to be necessary. The government will not provide any compensation for travel to or from this informational meeting, or any other costs associated with the attendance. The date/location of this meeting will be provided to those respondents who provide data related to the subject of this RFI.</p>

<DESC>DISTRIBUTION STATEMENT A: Approved for public release; distribution is unlimited. <br>    <br> I. PURPOSE: This Market research is being conducted to determine commercially available U.S. made tools that fit the required capabilities identified in Section II below. All tool components shall meet or exceed the Aerospace Standards (AS) and where AS are unavailable, industrial quality tools are adequate substitute(s). Industrial is a term used for a tool with the aim of meeting or exceeding American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) standards in addition to any other tool specific description contained in the product descriptions. Industrial quality tools are used primarily by skilled professionals and technicians in the following areas: machine shops, automotive maintenance and repair facilities, aircraft maintenance and repair facilities, industrial automotive assembly plants, fleet maintenance facilities, and airline service facilities. The tools will be used for specialized applications in an environment of virtual constant use, (i.e. around-the-clock 8-hour shifts), with applications requiring high torque, low slippage and strict tolerances. Advertising or marketing literature that indicates professional grade or industrial quality, or merely stating that an item is professional grade or industrial quality, is insufficient and will not institute industrial quality. A claim that an item is manufactured to an industry consensus standard is also unsatisfactory to establish industrial quality. Industrial quality tools shall have verifiable marketplace acceptance. The Government's requirement of high quality tools is paramount to the maintainers performing battlefield repair for the effective and efficient execution of mission requirements.  Recognizing that manufacturers have been designing and producing a variety of Industrial quality tools for years; the U.S. Army is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to gather information pertaining to your current practices.  <br>  <br> ATTENTION: Submission of any information in response to this Request for Information (RFI) is purely voluntary. This RFI is issued for information planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation or commit the Government to award a contract, now or in the future. This is not a request for proposal.   Nothing shall be construed herein or through this research process to commit or obligate the Government to further action as a result of this research. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow up information requests. Respondents to this RFI should not expect a response to their submission. Further information will be posted to this website if required and when available. All information submitted in response to this RFI shall become the property of the Government and will not be returned to the submitter. <br>  <br> II.

<DESC>Under the pending new solicitation, DLA Troop Support is proposing to combine canned and bottled beverage support with the Bag in Box (BIBs) products as part of the overall requirements for this acquisition.<br />DLA Troop Support is looking for vendors who are interested in providing Beverage Distribution services for Military Bases and other non-military customers located in CONUS, Navy Ships, Alaska, Hawaii and Guam. This is not a solicitation just sources being sought for vendors interested in working with the DLA Troop Support in the support of supplying only beverage products including BIB syrup, bottles and cans. The beverage products would consist of Bag-in-Box, beverage base liquid carbonated, non-carbonated, electrolytes and premium teas for use in contractor furnished post-mix dispensers, as well as bottles and cans. The scope of this procurement is to supply and deliver carbonated and non-carbonated beverage requirements (BIB, bottles and cans), supply, deliver and maintain C02 dispensers and other related fountain and dispensing equipment, distribution system capability, dual pour capability, EDI capability and quality assurance to provide just in time products available for delivery to customers in the CONUS, Navy Ships, Alaska, Hawaii and Guam. We want to be able to have a beverage contract that combines both BIB syrup with the bottles and cans. Be conscious of the fact that many customers are leaning towards a healthy choice, e.g., zero calorie drinks, in lieu of the standard soda flavors, so these healthy choices must be available in your inventory. Some of our concerns need to be address when you respond to this RFI. <br />1. DLA Troop Support proposes to combine cans/bottles beverage requirements with the Bag in the Box (BIB) into one contract. Will this work for you? If not, why? <br />2. DLA Troop Support wants to assess the feasibility of regional contracts, whereby pricing for all customers within the designated region will remain the same. Vendors would be expected to ensure all customers are charged the same price for identical products within the region, regardless of supplier or bottling location plant. Comments are requested.<br />This inquiry is open to both large business and small business. Vendors must be willing to accommodate our large customer base. If you feel your company has the capability to handle the beverage demands of our customer base, please submit your company's name, address, point of contact and email address as a source to inform you when the acquisition will be available. If interested, please email Contract Specialist, Brenda.M2.Hall@dla.mil.<br />

<DESC>THIS SCREENING INFORMATION REQUEST (SIR1) IS BEST VIEWED/DOWNLOADED FROM FAA CONTRACT OPPORTUNITIES WEB SITE, HTTPS://FAACO.FAA.GOV, KEYWORD: FDIO.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, contemplates the acquisition of thermal flight strips on a full-and-open competition basis.  Estimated quantities over a 5-year period (basic contract year with four 1-year options) are as follows:
	
Thermal Flight Terminal Full Strips, NSN 7530-01-453-5094
          6,307 boxes* each year for Base Contract period, and all Option periods.

*A single box contains 13 individual stacks of 1,000 continuous fanfold strips, folded singularly.

Thermal Flight Terminal Half Strips, NSN 7530-01-468-4688
          1,361 boxes* each year for Base Contract period, and all Option periods.

*A single box contains 13 individual stacks of 1,000 continuous fanfold strips, folded singularly.

Thermal Flight Enroute Oceanics Strips, NSN 7530-01-435-1872
          398 boxes* each year for Base Contract period, and all Option periods.

*A single box contains 10 individual stacks of 1,000 continuous fanfold strips, folded singularly.

The FAA has adopted a two-phase approach in accommodating this acquisition.  The first phase (identified as SIR1) involves offeror submission of non-converted material, thermal flight strips (bid samples) and technical documentation for testing and evaluation by the FAA against established specifications and standards.  Only those offerors submitting non-converted material, bid samples and required technical documentation that are found to conform to FAAs specifications and standards will be permitted to participate in the second phase of the acquisition process.  The second phase (identified as SIR2) will involve the issuance of a Screening Information Request (SIR2)/Request for Offers (RFO) with submission of price proposals based on each successful offerors submission under the first phase.

Under SIR1, interested offerors are invited to submit a sampling of non-converted material and bid samples.  The FAA will require two (2) sheets of non-converted material with dimensions of twenty-five (25) inches to be tested for compliance with the Technical Association of the Pulp and Paper Industry (TAPPI) specifications found in FAA Specification FAAD-F-1369-3, revised 10/28/13, and included as an attachment to this SIR1.  Bid samples will consist of ten (10) boxes of Flight Terminal Full Strips, NSN 7530-01-453-5094, containing 13 individual stacks, ten (10) boxes of Flight Terminal Half Strips, NSN 7530-01-468-4688, containing 13 individual stacks and ten (10) boxes of Enroute Oceanics strips, NSN 7530-01-435-1872, containing 10 individual stacks.  All stacks shall be 1,000 continuous fanfold strips, folded singularly.  Samples will be tested/evaluated against Paragraph 2.1.3, TAPPI Specification and Paragraph 3, Common Specifications, of FAA Specification FAAD-F-1369-3, Thermal Flight Strips, dated June 5, 2000.  Any offerors sampling of non-converted material failing to meet the specifications of Paragraph 2.1.3, TAPPI Specification will be eliminated from further consideration.  Bid samples will be returned at that point in time.  

In addition to specific criteria set forth at Paragraph 3 of the specifications, the FAA will ensure sharp quality printing by conducting a demonstration test using the bid samples submitted.  The demonstration will be completed with a thermal Flight Data Input/Output (FDIO) thermal printer, model number IER-512C-FSP.  The paper must allow printing of sharp [200 dots per inch (dpi)] characters without adjusting the print head, and more than 125,000 strips for NSN 7530-01-453-5094, 125,000 strips for NSN 7530-01-468-4688 and 100,000 strips for NSN 7530-01-435-1872 before any thermal print head dot failure.

Along with the sample material and bid samples to be submitted, offerors are to provide written documentation addressing the ability to meet the requirements of Paragraph 4.3, Contractor Quality Control Program Requirements, of FAA Specification FAAD-F-1369-3. 

A Bid Sample Waiver may be considered if a Contractor is currently in production of these NSNs for a federal Government prime contract, subcontract or purchase order or who has delivered these NSNs that have been accepted by the Government within the past three (3) years.  If a waiver is requested, the form Bid Sample Applicability and/or Conditions for Waiver (included with this SIR1) must be submitted along with the written documentation addressing the ability to meet the requirements of Paragraph 4.3.

No prices/pricing information is to be submitted at this time.  Bid samples must be received by the FAA, Attention:  Cynthia Vuong, AML-8050, TSF Bldg. No. 215, 6500 S. MacArthur Boulevard, Oklahoma City, OK 73169-6900, no later than 2:00 p.m. CST on February 6, 2014.  Bid samples must be packaged in accordance with Paragraph 5 (less pallet requirements) of FAA Specification FAAD-F-1369-3.  In addition to the labeling required under Paragraph 5.6 of the specification, boxes shall be labeled as follows:  Material (and/or) Bid Samples/DTFAAC-14-R-01617, Due 2:00 p.m. CST on February 6, 2014.

Offerors are advised that due to security measures at the Aeronautical Center, access to the installation is limited and hand delivery of responses will not be permitted.  Overnight delivery of responses to this SIR1 could also be impacted if not sent in sufficient time to allow for special mail handling procedures in place at the Aeronautical Center.

Potential offerors should note that the FAA reserves the right to communicate with one of more offerors at any time during the SIR process.

This SIR1 is not to be construed as a contract or a commitment of any kind.  The Government shall not be liable for payment of any costs attributed to the submission of bid samples for testing by the FAA nor costs attributed to the preparation and submission of requested technical documentation.  

Inquiries regarding this SIR1 should be directed to Contracting Officer, at connie.m.houpt@faa.gov.

<DESC>This posting serves as both the Sources Sought and Public Notification of Huntsville Engineering and Support Center's intent to issue a modification to the existing Operation and Maintenance Engineering Enhancement (OMEE) Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) Suite of contract holders to increase the capacity of the current contracts due to mission critical requirements. <br>  <br> 1.	NOTICE OF INTENT:  The U.S. Army Engineering and Support Center in Huntsville (CEHNC), Alabama intends to issue a non-competitive modification under the authority of FAR 6.302-1to the existing OMEE Multiple Award Task Order Contract (MATOC) Suite of contract holders to increase the capacity of the current contracts due to mission critical requirements.  This requirement is to provide and support the Operation and Maintenance Services including repair and replacement of equipment and minor construction services at Government medical and non-medical facilities in the continental United States (CONUS) and outside the continental United States (OCONUS) to include Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, Puerto Rice, Spain, Germany, Italy, Korea and Japan.  The award of the modification to increase capacity to the ID/IQ MATOC contract holders is anticipated to be in March 2014 and will be good only for the remaining option periods of the MATOC contracts.   The needed programmatic value increase for the ID/IQ MATOC suite is $35.3M.  The contracts included in this MATOC pool consist of six (6) small and four (4) large business contractors, namely:  <br> W912DY-11-D-0006 - Acepex Management Corporation <br> W912DY-11-D-0007 - Ames Corporation  <br> W912DY-11-D-0008 - EML/BMAR Joint Venture II, LLC  <br> W912DY-11-D-0009 - Global Engineering & Construction, LLC <br> W912DY-11-D-0010 - Quality Services International, LLC  <br> W912DY-11-D-0011 - VW International Incorporated  <br> W912DY-10-D-0049 - ABM Government Services <br> W912DY-10-D-0050 - LB&B Associates Incorporated  <br> W912DY-10-D-0051 - J&J Maintenance Incorporated  <br> W912DY-10-D-0052 - Emcor Government Services  <br>  <br> The purpose of this Sources Sought is to determine interest and capability available to perform the services described herein.  Interested sources should respond to the questions presented within this announcement in order to facilitate the Government's market research efforts.  The Government will analyze all responses and determine the strategy for this acquisition.   The Government does not intend to rank submittals or provide any reply to interested firms. <br>  <br> NOTE:  This programmatic capacity increase was already included in a previous Sources Sought (posted 12 September 2012) and Justification and Approval (J&A) (approved 3 April 2013) for a modification to the OMEE ID/IQ MATOC suite.  The J&A requested a capacity increase of $83.5M.  The J&A was approved for a capacity increase of only $48.2M which was $35.3M less than requested. The resulting modification was in the amount of $48.2M.  This Sources Sought is for a modification to increase contract capacity in the remaining amount of $35.3M.  This amount, in addition to the previously approved capacity increase, would total $83.5M, the amount originally requested. <br>  <br> 2.	Project Information - The services to be performed will include Facility Operation and Maintenance (O&M) Services, Corrective Maintenance (CM) Services, Corrective Maintenance Management Services, aseptic management services, grounds maintenance services, pest management services, medical equipment maintenance, minor construction within the facilities, and other General Corrective Maintenance Services for Medical Treatment Facilities.

<DESC>(1) Notice of intent to extend services. This action will result in a modification to the current contract, FA2550-08-C-8011, Network and Space Operations and Maintenance (NSOM), with Harris IT Services Corporation, 2100 Atlantic Blvd Suite 300, Dulles VA 20166-2496, for a period of one year. The period of this extension is contemplated to be from 30 Sep 2014 through 29 Sep 2015.
<p>(2) Harris IT Services is considered to be the only responsible offeror for extension of the services, as the Government would experience unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements if a new offeror were to be selected in the time remaining before the end of the current NSOM Option.</p>
<p>(3) In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 5.207(c)(16), all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>(4) The Government will not be responsible for any cost incurred by interested parties in preparation of information or documents related to this extension. A determination by the Government to extend these services and not to compete this proposed contract extension, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to extend these services. Any responses to this notice of contract action shall be submitted to: Stephen Cooper, Contracting Officer, at stephen.cooper.1@us.af.mil and Camille Watley, Contract Specialist, at camille.watley.2@us.af.mil.</p>
<p>(5) The 50th Contracting Squadron, 210 Falcon Parkway Suite 2116, Schriever AFB, plans to award a sole source contract to Harris IT Services Corporation for continued services currently provided under contract FA255-08-C-8011, Network and Space Operations and Maintenance (NSOM), which was awarded competitively 11 Jan 2008 and which included a six month base contract period (1 Apr 2008 - 30 Sep 2008) and six priced Options of one year each. The NSOM contract is currently in the last Option period, which ends after 29 Sep 2014. The NSOM contract is not being competed as a single follow-on contract; instead, current NSOM contract requirements will be performed under multiple new or existing contracts aligned with mission systems or mission requirements. The 50th Contracting Squadron anticipates that additional time will be required for other activities, as well as the 50th Space Wing, to complete the realignment of current NSOM requirements to other contract vehicles. The NSOM contract was competed and awarded with the clause 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, which authorizes the government to require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the NSOM contract, for a total extension of performance not to exceed six months. In addition, the 50th Contracting Squadron contemplates the negotiation of two additional Option periods, of three months each, which would be exercised if required to provide continuity of current NSOM contract services while the acquisition actions are completed for the contracts which will provide the services in the future. Therefore, this notice is for a total period of one year.</p>
<p>(6) Services provided under the NSOM contract, some or all of which may be included in an extension of the contract, include operations, maintenance, logistics support, training and related support for the Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN) at locations around the world; along with maintenance, logistics support, training and related support for the Global Positioning System (GPS) facilities located at locations around the world; full security forces services at New Boston AFS, New Hampshire, only; orbital analyst, technical advisory and software support services at Schriever AFB, Colorado; information assurance and safety services at Schriever AFB, Colorado and other 50 SW locations; and operation, maintenance and logistics support services for military satellite communications terminals at Schriever AFB, Colorado, New Boston AFS, New Hampshire and Vandenberg AFB, California.</p>

<p>Notice #: 14-021</p>
<p>Procurement Type: Special Notice - Notice of Intent to Sole Source</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. The Department of the Air Force, Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) intends to extend a sole source contract to Space Dynamics Laboratory (SDL), a University Affiliated Research Center (UARC), at Utah State University for the research and development of sensor systems. SMC/XR awarded this contract to SDL on 1 May 2009. The Government intends to extend the current SDL contract period of performance for an additional five years in order to complete on-going efforts and ensure available support for emerging infrared and hosted payload projects. The period of performance extension will not increase the contract cost ceiling.</p>
<p>This contract modification will provide SMC support in the following specific areas: <br />1. Increasing the Technology Readiness Level of full-earth Wide-Field-of-View (WFOV) Infrared (IR) systems, related components, and supporting architecture through test and evaluation, software development, and data processing <br />2. Second, to consolidate this expertise in one location and contract vehicle. Current work at SDL is contracted in pieces through several separate contracts held by various organizations. <br />3. Software development and data processing efforts including data compression/decompression, data visualization, data exploitation, data fusion, data processing, handling, and analysis. Current efforts in this area include, generating, implementing, testing, and performance assessment of potential new signal processing algorithms.<br />4. Modeling and simulation related to optics, structures, thermal characteristics, controls systems, pointing, contamination, orbit propagation, image processing, and scene generation.</p>
<p>Over the past five years providing UARC support to SMC on the Third Generation Infrared Surveillance (3GIRS) and follow-on programs, SDL has consistently demonstrated its ability to meet Government requirements across a broad spectrum of technical disciplines. Any interested Party must demonstrate its capabilities in the following areas of expertise:</p>
<p>1. The ability to design and develop; fabricate, assemble, handle, and integrate; and analyze, test, and evaluate sensor systems and components. This includes the ability to design, manufacture, test, and model cryogenic systems and thermal design; <br />2. Electronics assembly, including: cable and harness assembly, box and electronics assembly, integration, and inspection. <br />3. Vibration isolation and jitter control methods;<br />4. Sensor calibration, characterization, testing, and evaluation. Must have capability to do both environmental testing and sensor calibration, including facilities capable of accomplishing environmental testing such as thermal-vac, vibration, and EMI/EMC<br />5. Ability to perform relative spectral responsivitiy using Fourier transform spectrometry and cryogenic IR sensor calibration equipment.<br />6. Development of test plans and analysis of test data.</p>
<p>To accomplish future program objectives and meet near-term program milestones, Interested parties must be intimately familiar with WFOV IR staring sensors, have prior experience in the calibration of staring WFOV OPIR sensors with large format focal plane arrays, and also familiar with the current industry efforts in infrared sensing and hosted payload portfolios. Interested parties must be capable of supporting full environmental testing in and sensor calibration in Q1/Q2 of fiscal year 2016. Interested parties must operate facilities at and employ personnel cleared with Secret, TS and TS/SCI.</p>
<p>The information contained herein is based on the best information available at the time of publication, is subject to revision, and is not binding on the Government. This notice is for informational purposes only and is not a request for competitive proposals or a solicitation of offers.</p>
<p>Interested parties, including small and small disadvantaged businesses, may identify their interest and statement of technical capabilities, and submit information. Information shall not exceed 10 one-sided pages in length, must be in MS Word 2002 or higher or PDF format, and font no smaller than 12 point. A minimum DoD security clearance of Secret is mandatory. Interested parties must show capability to fulfill the Government's immediate need for the effort described above. The capabilities statement should address why the company believes that the sole source justification is not valid. This notice expires 17 January.</p>
<p>The NAICS code for this effort is 541380 and the small business size standard is $14 Million. Classification code A applies. Contractors interested in subcontracting opportunities are encouraged to contact SDL directly.</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;">Request for Information (RFI) - Sources Sought<br />Library Archival System (LAS) Replacement</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">(i) Objective of Request for Information<br /></span></strong>The Library of Congress (the Library) is conducting market research. This Request for Information (RFI) with its attachment is provided as information to the market place, and is an invitation for Respondents to express interest, an invitation to participate in an Informational Meeting, and to provide feedback on the Library's requirement. <br />The Library of Congress ("Library"), in conjunction with Harvard University and the University of Pennsylvania (Solicitors), currently use a proprietary Library Archival System (LAS) to inventory and track the location of the analog, i.e., physical, general collection items. Information gathered through this RFI may be used for a possible future Library requirement to implement and migrate to a new library inventory management system to replace the existing proprietary system (LAS). <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">(ii) Background of Existing Library Archiving System<br /></span></strong>The following is a brief description of the existing Library Archiving System.</p>
<p>The LAS is a relational database management system (RDBMS) written in the Progress (Bedford MA) 4GL programming language. It operates in a wide range of environments.</p>
<p>The application consists of various processing and maintenance modules such as accession, circulation, file maintenance, billing; and database comprised of a series of tables (item, tray, location, order, transfile, history, client and some temp tables such as that for accession). Governing access are interface-level administrative modules for the system developer and Progress system administrator.</p>
<p>Access can be controlled by user role through the use of "user classes," which is readily accessible through the current interface. Typical access to the system requires two logins - first to the host machine, and then to LAS. Access to varying levels of database maintenance in LAS can be controlled so that users are logged into role-appropriate modules (e.g. accession only).</p>
<p>In a typical multi-user application, extensive use of record locking ensures system integrity. System development tends to follow a default to record locking, with simple "no-lock" statements used for exceptions such as certain reports.</p>
<p>Batch processing controls all production processing, which aids greatly in error control and workflow efficiency. Most elements of the production modules have been designed around workflow. The orders created in this batch approach serve later to create billing transactions as well as permanent historical indices for either standardized ("canned") reports or more nuanced queries. Residing at a higher level than the history table: searches of the latter are most efficient when reference to an order number is the index. In the case of refile orders, the "closure" thereof is a daily manual action taken only when all items have been successfully re-shelved.</p>
<p>Daily exports of accession and (closed) refile items to the Voyager Integrated Library System (ILS) are automatically scheduled for off-hours. Other such exports included errors relevant to ILS processing that did not prevent LAS accession. Planned enhancements include automated real-time exports of non-availability of retrieval requests to at least a library server, with extension to patron personal mobile device.</p>
<p>The great majority of all standardized reports (including client-facing billing summaries and statements) were designed in the more print-focused environment of the early 1990s. For a number of the most useful reports, the developer added output options for a file with .csv extension on request from the user.</p>
<p>The current plain text user interface (ca. 1993), while highly functional, is fairly antiquated. Modern system architectures can accommodate system functionality in a more user-friendly environment.</p>
<p>Application and database support is provided by the developer's application developer and systems / environment specialist, who have appropriate access to the server for most of their needs.</p>
<p>LAS and system redundancy is accomplished with use of 2 identical servers and environments, in which user actions on the primary server are written to a failover system in asynchronous mode, which renders any related overhead imperceptible, and exposure to data loss limited to the most recent scan or update. Server systems are backed up offsite daily.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>(iii) Background on the Library and the Solicitors' Depository and Libraries</strong></span></p>
<p>The Library of Congress' mission is to support the Congress in fulfilling its constitutional duties and to further the progress of knowledge and creativity for the benefit of the American people. The Library's scope of responsibility has been considerably widened by subsequent legislation, and its range of service has come to include the entire governmental establishment in all its branches as well as the public at large, so that it now serves as the national library for the United States.</p>
<p>The Library is the largest library in the world, with more than 155.3 million items on approximately 838 miles of bookshelves. The collections include 35 million books and other print materials 13.6 million photographs, 5.4 million maps, 6.5 million pieces of sheet music and 68 million manuscripts. The Library receives some 15,000 items each working day and adds approximately 11,000 items to the collections daily. The majority of the collections are received through the Copyright registration process, as the Library is home to the U.S. Copyright Office.</p>
<p>The Library is not a circulating library in the sense of most libraries. Of the 35 million books and other print materials, only 200,000 circulate in a year, primarily as last resort interlibrary loans to research libraries throughout the world and as direct loans to Members of Congress and their staff. Most materials are used within the Library's 19 reading rooms or study facilities. Except for reading room reference collections, all stacks and storage facilities at the Library are closed to the public.</p>
<p>Unlike most other national libraries, the Library's extensive collections are universal in scope. They include materials on every subject and in a multitude of languages. Among them are the most comprehensive collections of Chinese, Japanese, and Russian language books outside Asia and Europe; general collections of the arts, humanities, science and technology; legal materials essential for study and understanding of American and foreign law; and the most extensive collection in the Western Hemisphere of books printed before 1501 A.D The Library provides a wide variety of national and international services. These include a centralized cataloging program whereby the Library acquires material published all over the world, catalogs it, and distributes cataloging information in machine-readable form; interlibrary loan of materials in its collections to other institutions; the exchange of duplicates with other institutions; and the reproduction of materials in its collections. In addition, the Library works with other standards-setting organizations; publishes print catalogs and bibliographies; circulates items from the Library's collections in travelling exhibits; provides books in Braille and "talking book" recordings for the blind and physically handicapped; and is a leader in efforts to digitize retrospective American collections.</p>
<p>The Harvard Depository is a secure, climate-controlled high-density storage and retrieval facility designed primarily for the long-term preservation of books and other paper-based materials, film, and magnetic media. The Depository is owned and operated by Harvard University, under the directorship of the Harvard Library administration. <br /><br />Opening in 1986, the Depository currently houses over 9.4 million items on approximately 75 miles of shelving, more than half the University's 17,000,000 holdings. Over 400,000 items are transferred to the Depository each year; annual circulation is well over 200,000, or 2.4% of holdings in storage. <br />During its first 25 years, the Depository's scope has expanded to include service as the primary repository for the records management needs of several hundred University departments and programs. In 1988, the Depository welcomed materials from MIT, which now comprise 9% of holdings. Since 2005, the Depository has also served as one of the print repositories for the JSTOR online resource, whose holdings now occupy well over 1,000 shelves. Fulfillment of imaging requests of Depository holdings began in 2009, and has grown to well over 10,000 annually or 5% of all circulation. The so-called "Harvard model" has been emulated by several dozen institutions nationwide, including Stanford, Cornell, the ReCAP at Princeton, and internationally at the Bodleian Library at Oxford.<br />Designed primarily for high-density storage and warehousing efficiency, and located some 30 miles from campus, the Depository does not offer a reading room and is not open to the larger University community. Requests for stored materials are fulfilled daily via communication between the ILS and Depository inventory system, and are shipped to libraries each morning by the University's campus services.</p>
<p>Since 1750, University of Pennsylvania Libraries have served the teaching, research and learning needs of world-class scholars. The collection, founded by Franklin, is housed in 15 libraries with over 7 million volumes plus a vast digital library of millions more. The libraries include: Anne and Jerome Fisher Fine Arts Library (Art and Architecture), designed by Frank Furness; Annenberg Library (School of Communications), located in the Annenberg School; Biomedical Library, located adjacent to the Robert Wood Johnson Pavilion of the Medical School; Chemistry Library, located in the 1973 Wing of the Chemistry Building; Dental Medicine Library; Engineering Library, located on the second floor of the Towne Building in the Engineering School; Jean Austin duPont Veterinary Medicine Library - New Bolton Center; Katz Center for Advanced Judaic Studies, located on Walnut Street at Washington Square; Lippincott Library (Wharton School), located on the second floor of the Van Pelt-Dietrich Library Center; Math/Physics/Astronomy Library, located on the third floor of David Rittenhouse Laboratory; Museum Library (Anthropology); Otto E.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the National Weather Service (NWS) awarded a purchase order 25 each ABL 34 Tooth Drive Gear, P/N 34636-5015-1, (ASN: R400-2A1A1A2MP1) to Southern Gear &amp; Machine, Inc. for NEXRAD Sub Systems stock replenishment spares that support the NEXRAD program. The ABL 34 T Gear is a critical element of the radar Data Package Assembly and was built to specification for Radiation Systems, Inc., specifically for use in the WSR-88D Data Package Assembly. The design and performance of the gear is tightly controlled by the governing Source Control Document (SCD). Testing this gear was conducted in order to qualify it for use in the WSR-88 Data Package Assembly. Southern Gear and Machine remains the only manufacturer qualified to produce this component, since no other components have been tested in the WSR-88D transmitter. The use of a different product would require additional integration testing. If a suitable component was available from another manufacturer, its performance would have to be validated in operational radar and vendor would have to undergo a qualification process in order to be listed as a suggested source. Southern Gear and Machine was introduced to the system only after exhaustive engineering testing. The design cannot be replicated by other vendors without violating Radiation Systems intellectual property rights and any other suggested source would require additional integration testing, technical drawing changes, warehouse files, and additional man hours. This item was purchased for the National Weather Service (NWS) NEXRAD spare parts program, to be delivered to the National Logistics Support Center located in Kansas City, MO. The proposed contract action was issued as a sources sought notice that was posted on FedBizOpps under Solicitation No. NWWG01401400551KC on December 24, 2013 that resulted in only one response to the notice. An award was issued to Southern Gear &amp; Machine, Inc.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA, Eastern Acquisition Division-Kansas City (EAD-KC) and the National Weather Service (NWS) intend to award a purchase order for supplies that support the Dual Pole System. This requirement is to obtain RDA Interface Unit Assemblies for NEXRAD Sub Systems for stock replenishment spares that support the NEXRAD program. Baron Services is the designer and manufacturer of the Dual Pole System and is the only known responsible source for these parts. Item No. 0001: Circuit Card Assembly, RS-232 to RS-422 Multiplexer, P/N BS-2000-056-000; Qty: 10 ea; Item No. 0002: Circuit Card Assembly, RDAIU IF Switch Control (DT), P/N BS-2000-057-000; Qty: 5 ea; Item No. 0003: RDA Interface Unit Assembly, P/N BS-2000-055-000; Qty: 4 ea; Item No. 0004: RDA Interface Unit Assembly, Redundant (A40), P/N BS-2000-055-001; Qty: 4 ea. These items are being purchased for the National Weather Service (NWS), NEXRAD program, to be delivered to the National Logistics Support Center, Kansas City, MO. The unique characteristics and physical form of these items make them the only acceptable parts. Because the design is the intellectual property of Baron Services, the Government does not have access to the specific design features. The Government has no design rights to the items and does not possess the drawings that specify the parts. The proposed contract action was issued as a sources sought notice that was posted on FedBizOpps under Solicitation No. NWWG01401400559KC on December 24, 2013, that resulted in only one response to the notice.

The needed programmatic value increase for the ID/IQ MATOC suite is $35.3M.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   <br>  <br> sole source to datamill,llc,weatherford, tx, cage code 4ua41. <br>  <br> the proposed acquisition will result in a new firm fixed price contract for the purchase  of a license for use of the repair center/launcher database management  system. the contract will consist of a one-year base contract with a period of performance 1 march 2014 - 28 feb 2015, plus four one  year option periods, ending 31 march 2019. the base period of the contract will be funded with fiscal year 2014 missile procurement, army (mipa) funds, along with funding from the us marine corps. <br>  <br>  <br> the life cycle launcher support (lcls) team of the precision fires rocket and missile system (pfrms) logistics division utilizes repaircenter as a standard logistics database for those items which fall under the performance based logistics (pbl) contract. pfrms refers to repaircenter as the launcher database management  system (ldms). repaircenter/ldms  provides lifecycle tracking data that enables timely, cost-effective modifications and repair for weapon systems.  it utilizes client/server architecture and encompasses standard logistics and information management processes for all aspects of an operations system, including: stock control and distribution, maintenance data collection, shipping/receiving, calibration status, and system status reporting. repaircenter's wide range of capabilities enhances system management. <br>  <br> this action is authorized under the provisions of section 4202 of the clinger-cohen act of 1996, as implemented by federal acquisition regulation (far) 13.501(a) (ii), the test program for commercial items. <br>  <br> the proposed award is to be made to datamill, llc, weatherford, tx,cage code 4ua41.  datamill is the database which provides numerous support capabilities for the himars and the m270a1 launchers. pfrms logistics division must maintain continuous visibility of high cost repairable spares and requires both rapid and traceable shipment of serviceable spares to deployed units and return of unserviceable  items for repair to ensure continued readiness of the overseas contingency operations deployed fleet as well as support non deployed units. a database change would disrupt the continuous visibility of spares, and impact readiness. <br>  <br> This is not a request for competive proposals. no contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice. <br>  <br> Determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based on this notice is soley within the discretion of the government. <br>  <br>

<ARCHDATE>03082014
<CONTACT>JOANNE M. MURPHY
<DESC>Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) Number:  E14PS00020 for Proposed Research on Safety Technology Verification for Materials and Corrosions Research.
DESCRIPTION: The U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) solicits White Papers of not more than five (5) pages in length, for specific areas of interest to BSEE Technology Assessment Program (TAP) on Safety and Technology Verification for Materials and Corrosions in the US Outer Continental Shelf.  When appropriate, the research shall be conducted consistently with prior research.  For a summary of research previously completed and recently performed, visit http://bsee.gov/Research-and-Training/Operational-Safety-and-Engineering.aspx. Interested parties are encouraged to view the information presented on the site when considering submitting white papers.
BACKGROUND:   The Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) TAP Program is requesting white papers to be submitted in accordance with the terms of this announcement. Selected white papers will be requested to submit proposals.  NOTICE:  The BSEE may share the White Papers with other organizations for review.  Potential contractors shall notify the BSEE if they do not want their White Papers/proposals shared outside of BSEE.  BSEE anticipate multiple awards resultant to this announcement and anticipated to be made on a Firm Fixed-Price (FFP) basis. 
OBJECTIVES: The topics for this BAA, Safety and Technology Verification research are as follows:  
1.	Corrosion Evaluation:  Currently, there are inconsistencies amongst industry standards in regards to the mechanical property requirements (i.e., hardness, yield strength, ultimate tensile strength (UTS)) needed for implementing corrosion resistance programs as it relates to hydrogen embrittlement for fasteners (bolts) used in subsea oilfield operations.  This evaluation will have the vendor evaluate various industry standards to determine the optimal material hardness, UTS, and yield strength values for bolt materials and make a recommendation to BSEE on how these standards should be modified to address these findings or how BSEE should structure a 30 CFR 250 regulation to require these conditions be met for bolts.  The vendor will also be asked to develop a series of test protocols and analyses (including FEA) to determine the ideal material hardness, yield strength and UTS for fastener materials when such test protocols, procedures and analyses are not included in the evaluated standards. 
2.	HPHT Material Evaluations:  There is a high safety risk potential in OCS oil and gas subsea operations when using elastomers and composite materials as packers and measurement technologies under HPHT conditions (> 15,000 psi and > 350F).  To mitigate the high risk and improve safety, BSEE needs to determine and evaluate the material properties, and compatibility of potential elastomers and composite materials for use in down hole packers and measurement electronics (e.g. polymer infused cable, wire line fiber optics) for use during HPHT oil and gas operations.  As part of this evaluation, the vendor will compile a series of test protocols, laboratory testing procedures, and analyses (including FEA) for material properties that should be submitted by operators in plan and permits to demonstrate that the equipment is fit for service in HPHT oil and gas operations.  This knowledge will improve BSEEs ability to effectively review the submittals.
HOW TO RESPOND: White Papers of not more than five (5) pages in length, an ORIGINAL PLUS three (3) copies and one (1) electronic copy in PDF format, on a CD, shall be submitted to the U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, Acquisition Operations Branch, 381 Elden St., Herndon, VA 20170-4817, ATTN: Joanne Murphy, not later than 3:00 PM, Eastern Daylight Saving Time on February 6, 2014.  WHITE PAPERS SENT THROUGH EMAIL AND FAXES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.  White Papers shall define the proposed research scope and include the level of effort.  NOTE THAT COST ESTIMATES ARE NOT TO BE INCLUDED IN THE WHITE PAPER.  The White Papers shall be evaluated only on technical merits.  IF YOUR WHITE PAPER IS SELECTED FOR FURTHER EVALUATION, A TECHNICAL AND COST/BUSINESS PROPOSAL WILL BE REQUESTED FROM YOUR COMPANY BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER.  Projects shall be selected from all or part of the technical issues listed depending on the interest and scope of White Papers received.  BSEE shall evaluate the responses, and those deemed to have merit shall be furnished information to assist in the preparation of the complete proposal.  This announcement constitutes a Request for White Papers, but does not obligate the Government to consummate award.  Respondents WILL NOT be notified of the results of the evaluation on the information submitted. 
WHITE PAPERS SHALL BE EVALUATED USING THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA: (1) feasibility of the approach or solution; (2) the Offerors understanding of the technical issues; (3) the Offerors ability to implement the proposed approach; (4) innovative or creative approaches or solutions including the participation and/or funding by the oil and gas industry or other groups in the research industry, where appropriate; and (5) past performance. IF ANY OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT ARE NOT MET, THE WHITE PAPER WILL NOT BE EVALUATED.  Questions shall be E-mailed to the Contracting Officer, Joanne.Murphy@bsee.gov not later than 3:00 PM, Eastern Daylight Saving Time on January 15, 2014. The Solicitation number E14PS00020 MUST be in the subject line of the E-mail.  All questions shall include the Solicitation number E14PS00020, your full name and title, your organization, complete address, and telephone and fax numbers.  Telephone inquiries WILL NOT be accepted.  A separate White Paper shall be submitted for each topic/study on which the offeror wishes to propose.  The White Paper shall identify clearly the Offerors company/organization, point of contact, address, telephone and facsimile numbers.  
If Offerors desire to hand deliver their White Papers, they are advised that the BSEE facility is a secure office complex and Offerors MUST NOT enter the building beyond the lobby. There is a courtesy telephone at the guard station to which you must call extension 7-1070 for a procurement official to meet and receive your submittal. 
POINT OF CONTACT:  Joanne Murphy, Contract Officer, phone number: (703) 787-1024, or email (preferred): Joanne.Murphy@BSEE.gov.  You MUST contact the Contracting Officer and set up an appointment 24 hours in advance of dropping off your White Paper.

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MedLog) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought Notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Epidural Trays and Needles. This is not a request for quote or proposal. The MMESO Europe is the lead MMESO for this project.</strong>
<p>These Epidural Trays and Needles products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.</p>
<p>This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2 for Epidural Trays and Needles. All items proposed to be included in this QSL must be on a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. All participating vendors must complete the certification in the DAPA Management System (DMS). The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (as defined by FAR 52.225-5), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to complete the DAPA TAA Certification. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Bill Woltjen at DLA Troop Support, William.woltjen@dla.mil, 215-737-7124.</p>
<p>The QSL for Epidural Trays and Needles will be established approximately June 2014 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. Qualified vendors will be invited approximately July 2014 to submit pricing proposals to enter into an Incentive Agreement for Epidural Trays and Needles. The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Epidural Trays and Needles.</p>
<p>A. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Epidural Trays and Needles. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $1,525,227.16. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Thirty-three product groupings were found to be relevant to the scope of this standardization action. Of the thirty-three product groups, twelve represent the clinically significant product groups for the QSL. Three of those twelve items are considered the requirements for addition to the QSL and account for 86.71% ($1,322,577.43) of the total volume in sales ($1,525,227.16). The specifications for this project are shown in "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.</p>
<p>B. Instructions to Vendors<br /><strong>Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must provide an e-mail response to this QSL FBO</strong> Sources Sought notification to the lead MMESO POCs below. The vendor's responses must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. <br />As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL", vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the date listed for closing in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the instant QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action. </strong></span></p>
<p>C. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection and coordinate logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The board is chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO Areas of Responsibility (AORs) and includes clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to review responses and evaluate products for selection to the QSL IAW FAR 9.2.</p>

These procedures apply to the HQAMC-Level Protest Program only. <BR> <BR>?	Interested Parties: An interested party is an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract.

Time for filing any document expires at 4:30 PM (EST) on the given day. ?	Election of forum: After an interested party protests an AMC procurement to HQAMC and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the HQAMC-level protest, the HQAMC-level protest will be dismissed.

?	Required information: Protests must be signed by an authorized representative of the protester. o	Protester?s name o	Address o	Telephone number o	Fax number o	Solicitation or contract number o	Identity of the contracting activity and the contracting officer?s name o	Detailed statement of all legal and factual grounds for protest (mere disagreement with the decisions of contracting officers does not constitute grounds for protest) o	Copies of all relevant documents o	Request for a ruling o	Request for relief <BR> <BR>?

Belvoir, VA 22060-5527 Fax: (703) 806-8866 or 8875 o	Packages sent by FedEx or UPS should be addressed to: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel Room 2-1SE3401 1412 Jackson Loop Fort Belvoir, VA 22060-5527 o	Protest to Contracting Officer shall be filed at: Appropriate installation address or see FAR Clause 52.233-2 in section L for address. ?	Processing of HQAMC-level protests: Within 10 working days after the protest is filed, the contracting officer, with the assistance of legal counsel, shall file with the HQAMC Office of Command Counsel (ATTN: AMCCC-PL) one copy of an administrative report in response to the protest. Reports shall be sent by fax, over-night mail or hand-delivered to ensure timely receipt. 
The HQAMC protest decision authority will issue a written decision within 20 working days of the protest filing. The written decision will be binding on AMC and its contracting activities. 

For good cause shown, the HQAMC protest decision authority may grant extensions of time for filing the administrative report and for the issuance of the written decision.

52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. 
HQ Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401 Ft. Belvoir, VA  22060-5527 Facsimile Number:  (703) 806-8866 or 8875

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Quotes are being requested and a written solicitation document will not be issued. It is incumbent upon contractors to monitor the FedBizOpps web page (https://www.fbo.gov) for any/all subsequent amendments. FedBizOpps also contains an option for automatic notification services.
<p>This combined synopsis/solicitation document and the incorporated provisions and clauses it contains are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-72. The NAICS code for this requirement is 721110. The size standard is $30.0 million. This is an unrestricted acquisition.</p>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS)/Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has a requirement to acquire conference/meeting space as well as accommodate hotel/motel guest rooms for up to a total of 245 "rooms per night" for participants attending the FY 2013 Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) panel review within a 40 mile radius of BWI Thurgood Marshall Airport, Reagan National Airport (DCA), or Washington Dulles International Airport (IAD).</p>
<p>FEMA prefers to schedule the meeting for February 10 - 14, 2014 (Check in on February 9th, check out on February 14th with the primary meeting activities February 10th - 14th). FEMA will consider proposals submitted by all offerors who can provide these services, however, if the offeror is not a hotel/motel or conference center as a primary line of business in the hospitality industry (Event Planning Services or 3rd Party Event Planning firms, for example), these offerors must provide a signed written letter of intent between the offeror and the hosting facility indicating such a contracting arrangement and confirm the necessary space is available as offered. Additionally, if the successful offeror selected as the primary contractor is not the actual hosting facility, the primary contractor in this case shall be required to have an employee onsite during the entire time period of the event to provide for, and maintain the privity of contract relationship with the Government to manage the onsite activities on behalf of the contractor and the Government in dealing with the hosting facility and management.</p>
<p>The period of performance for the meeting is February 10th - 14th. Alternate dates of availability that meet the above time and space requirements between January 21, 2014 and February 28, 2014 will be considered.</p>

Callers must identify themselves as participants (attendees) of the "FY 2013 Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) review panel," and give the dates for which they will require lodging. Offeror will state the duration for blocking the guest rooms before releasing the unreserved rooms for sale to the general public.</p>
<p>The quoted price shall represent the total price (fixed rates proposed for all services) for the entire period for which the conference will be held.

Offerors shall also provide a copy of their standard business practices identifying all terms and conditions upon which the quote is based. A purchase order in the amount sufficient to cover costs quoted for services specified will be issued to the lowest priced, technically acceptable responsible offeror.

<p>I. Background</p>
<p>The Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) Program Office operates under the authority of FEMA's Grant Programs Directorate within the Department of Homeland Security. In FY 2013, Congress appropriated a total of $320,920,083 under the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2013, (Public law 113-6) to carry out the activities of the Assistance to Firefighters Grants (AFG) Program. <br />The AFG online applications were conducted in November and December of 2013. The AFG program generates an average of more than 16,000 applications annually. The AFG grant opportunities are competitive and discretionary and each application must be evaluated independently against established criteria in order to assure fair and equitable opportunity for each. This independent evaluation is conducted by a panel of subject matter specialists who are flown in for one week to review and evaluate the applications.</p>
<p>In order to accomplish the panel reviews, the program will need to secure commercial conference space. Due to the size and timing of the required panel operations, available Federal facility space is not adequate. We expect that we will need to conduct one week of panels for AFG. In that week we will use as many as 200 subject matter specialists who will be supported by as many as 20 Federal and 25 contract support staff.</p>
<p>II. Scope of Work</p>
<p>The government requires facility space to conduct FY2013 AFG panel reviews during the projected week of February 10-14, 2014, for up to 250 participants. It is the AFG program office's preference that conference facilities be located within a 40 mile radius of Washington area airports- the Baltimore/Washington International (BWI) Thurgood Marshall Airport or the Reagan National Airport (RNA), or Washington Dulles International Airport (IAD). The program office must supervise and provide security to transport grant applications from the support contractor to the conference center for the review. The area near BWI airport, Reagan National Airport (RNA), and Washington Dulles International Airport (IAD) are conducive to the secure transfer of grant applications as well as flight hubs for subject matter experts' and regional staff's travel expediency.</p>
<p>The purpose of this document is to identify the facility characteristics that are minimally necessary to support the grant program office's implementation, management, and administration of the FY2013 AFG panel review process. Specifically: i) conference facility located within a 40 mile radius of BWI Thurgood Marshall Airport, Reagan National Airport (DCA), or Washington Dulles International Airport (IAD); ii)lodging for the panelists, support staff; iii) transportation to-and-from the BWI Thurgood Marshall Airport, the Reagan National Airport (DCA), or Washington Dulles International Airport (IAD); iv) conference/ballroom space to conduct the FY2013 AFG panels; v) securable breakout rooms or other workable space within the immediate proximity of the primary conference space for support of the FY2013 AFG panel process; vi) internet connectivity; and vii), availability to a high speed copier, A/V equipment, projector and networked computers/high speed printers.</p>
<p>III. Tasks</p>
<p>A. Tasks associated to the lodging of the panelists and staff for the AFG panel process:</p>
<p>Task A-1. It is FEMA's desire to hold this meeting the week of February 10-14, 2014.

Lodging is to be available in the same building as the conference facilities. The contract shall pay costs associated with the conference rooms as applicable and A/V costs. All attendees will be responsible for individual arrangements and responsible for paying any incidental room charges such as phone, pay per view video, room service, etc. In the event that the contractor does not have the desired dates of February 8-14th available, the contractor is requested to also provide alternative dates of availability that meet the above time and space requirements between January 21, 2014 and February 28, 2014.</p>

<p>(c)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record ``Active''.</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims).

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695<br /></p>

<p>The contractor shall provide a facility accessible from a navigable waterway at which a ship of the characteristics described in the attached specification can, using its own propulsion, safely arrive, lie afloat and depart at all states of the tide and at any time day or night. The facility and its approaches shall have a minimum water depth of 4.6' and a minimum vertical clearance of 24'6" The facility shall insure 2 (two) additional feet below minimum water depth at the pier per SFLC Standard Specification 0000 section 3.3.2.1.1.</p>

<p>The Contractor shall make reasonable arrangements with the Government or Contractors of the Government, as shall have been identified and authorized by the Contracting Officer, to be given admission to the Contractor's facilities and access to the vessel(s) and to office space, work areas, storage or shop areas, or other facilities and services, necessary for the performance of their respective responsibilities and reasonable to their performance.

<p>(6) MAINTAINING, REPORTING, AND DISPOSING OF GOVERNMENT PROPERTY IN THE PERFORMANCE OF A SHIP REPAIR CONTRACT</p>
<p>1. The Government Property Clause incorporated by reference delineates the contractor's overall responsibility when taking possession of government property in performance of a contract. In performance of this contract the contractor will be required to properly identify, track and control property within its possession. This includes, a) property furnished by the government (GFP) to the contractor in conjunction with specific CLIN Items. These items and their values are listed in the specification, b) property that is pre-existing in a location that during the course of performance will be replaced or renewed. <br /><br />2. The items listed in the specification, as government furnished property will be provided in the quantities designated. Government furnished property may be provided in person by an official Coast Guard employee, shipment via commercial carrier, etc. The contractor shall sign for all government furnished property using either a DD Form 1149, entitled, "Requisition and Invoice/Shipping Document" or a DD Form 1348, entitled, "Issue Release/Receipt Document". A copy of the DD 1149 or DD 1348 must be sent within 48 hours of receipt of property, to the designated Government Property Administrator. The name of the individual assigned as Property Administrator will be furnished to the contractor at time of award. The contractor shall not take receipt of property that is not listed in the specification, has not been previously identified as becoming part of the contract (via contract modification) or which otherwise cannot be identified. Such irregularities shall be immediately reported to the Property Administrator.</p>
<p>3. The contractor shall complete the report provided herein, entitled, "Government Property Report". This report is intended as a living document whereby relevant fields shall be filled in, maintained and kept current at all times. All property described in paragraph 1 (a, and b) above shall be reported on the report. At contract completion the contractor and the Property Administrator shall ensure that all fields are appropriately completed. A signature block is provided at the end of the report for both parties to attest to the report's accuracy and completeness. The Government Property Report shall clearly delineate the complete track that all government property took over the course of the contract. This completed report must accompany the contractor's final invoice. Final payment may be delayed, without penalty of interest, until such time as the report is received. A separate copy of the completed report and any final DD 1149s or DD 1348s executed, as a result of carrying out disposition instructions shall be provided to the Property Administrator.<br /><br />4. Pursuant to the Government Property Clause the authority to render disposition instructions of Government property associated with this contract is delegated to the Property Administrator. The contractor shall comply with all instructions in the contract for the return of government property to the Coast Guard. This includes government property taken off the vessel (shafts, propellers, etc.), government property returned to the vessel (special tools, etc.) or surplus government property not used during performance of the contract.</p>
<p>(7) GROWTH WORK</p>
<p>(a) The Contractor shall not perform growth work without the Contracting Officer's authorization. Growth work is work within the scope of the contract, which has not been previously priced as a pre-priced CLIN. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to contract for growth work on the basis of a negotiated, firm, fixed price, when it is in the best interest of the Government. If a firm-fixed price contract is awarded, and during the performance period a repair within scope is identified but the Contracting Officer and Contractor are unable to agree on the cost of the work, a bilateral modification may be incorporated into the contract using a Time and Materials modification for this specific repair. In this situation, FAR 52.212-4, Alternate I, will be incorporated.</p>
<p><br />(b) The Contractor shall furnish a price breakdown directly to the Contracting Officer, itemized as required by the Contracting Officer, of any proposal submitted for a contract modification. Unless otherwise directed, the breakdown shall be submitted on a Contractor Proposal Form provided at the arrival conference permitting an analysis of all materials, labor, equipment, subcontract, overhead costs, and profit covering all work involved in the change/modification whether such work was deleted, added or changed. Any amount claimed for subcontracts shall be supported by a separate, similar price breakdown. If the proposal includes a request for a time extension, justification shall be furnished with the proposal.</p>
<p><br />(c) This clause is to be used in conjunction with the clause COMPOSITE LABOR RATE incorporated into this solicitation. The Contractor is required to have and/or furnish all tools and equipment incidental to each bench trade. Supplies such as wiping rags, hacksaw blades, sandpaper, welding wire, helium, etc., are also to be furnished by the contractor. Other materials are to be charged at regular rates and prices currently in effect and as agreed to by the Contracting Officer. Material shall be best commercial quality available except where a precise specification is indicated in which case the specification shall apply, e.g., MILSPEC, FEDERAL SPEC.</p>
<p>(8) COMPOSITE LABOR RATE:</p>
<p>The composite labor rate offered shall be the sole labor hour rate used to price the prime contractor's direct labor hours for contract changes, i.e. growth work. The contractor shall not receive any compensation in addition to this rate for the prime contractor's direct labor associated with such changes under this contract.</p>
<p>(a) The composite labor hour rate shall represent total compensation for the following:<br />(1) direct labor wages and salaries;<br />(2) all employee benefits including, but not limited to, paid leave, supplemental pay, insurance, retirement, savings, and legally required benefits;<br />(3) other direct costs associated with transit time, delay, disruption, expendable supplies, and equipment;<br />(4) all indirect costs such as overhead and general and administrative expense;<br />(5) any port or association fees, rents, or other levies;<br />(6) profit (fee); and<br />(7) all direct and indirect costs and profit associated with the following support functions:<br />Supervision and Management Planning and Estimating<br />Material Handling Housekeeping<br />Engineering Transportation/Drivers<br />Quality Assurance Contract Administration<br />Security Testing</p>
<p>(b) The composite labor hour rate will be applied to production labor hours only. Production labor hours include only those hours necessary and reasonable to perform direct production functions and do not include the hours expended on the support functions listed above. This exclusion of support function hours applies whether such support functions are normally charged directly or indirectly by the contractor's accounting system. These support functions are to be priced into the composite labor rate quoted and shall not be separately compensated.</p>
<p>(c) The Quantity of Composite Labor hours indicated in the Schedule of Supplies/Services, is only an estimate and is an Optional Item pursuant to this solicitation. The Estimated Quantity represents the Government's best estimate of the total number of additional hours that may be required throughout the contract. The Government may elect to exceed this value at the prices stated in the schedule and its discretion during performance of the contract. The inclusion of this item does not obligate the Government to exercise the item nor entitle the contractor to compensation if not exercised.</p>
<p><br />(9) METHOD OF PAYMENT AND INVOICING INSTRUCTIONS FOR SHIP REPAIR</p>
<p>The Government will make payment under this contract based on a percentage or stage of completion. The contractor may invoice each contract line item/CLIN as work progresses. The amount invoiced shall be calculated based on those prices stipulated in the contract Schedule of Supplies/Services as follows:</p>
<p>An item/CLIN may not be invoiced until the percentage complete reaches 25 percent. Future invoices for that item/CLIN have no limitation as to the percentage of completion required before invoicing. (The minimum percentage of completion (25%) to be reached prior to billing each item/CLIN may be waived by the Contracting Officer on a case by case basis for large dollar items/CLINS.)</p>

<p>All payments for partial performance rendered by the Government under this contract are based on the assumption that the contractor will, in good faith, execute and honor all payment terms entered into between it, the prime contractor, and any subcontractor thereof in the performance of this contract. The contractor hereby acknowledges the Government's right to reduce or suspend progress payments based on non-payment in accordance with any payment terms of the subsequent agreement.</p>
<p>All items of work invoiced under this contract will be verified by the designated billing office and confirmed by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) as accurate and complete.</p>
<p>Any amount deemed not payable will be deducted from the contractor's invoice. Deducted amounts may be resubmitted on the next invoice for reconsideration.</p>
<p>The contractor's final invoice submitted under the contract must be marked as follows: "THIS INVOICE CONSTITUTES THE FINAL INVOICE - UPON PAYMENT OF THIS INVOICE NO OTHER MONIES ARE DUE UNDER CONTRACT NUMBER (To be assigned upon contract award).</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

STATEMENT OF WORK<br />POSITION DESCRIPTION<br />BACKGROUND<br />The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.<br />Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful and failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.<br />To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate, OTI retains a group of high-level professionals and experts under U.S. personal services contracts (USPSCs).<br />3 | P a g e<br />Solicitation for a USPSC OTI Senior Program Operations Specialist<br />SOL-OTI-14-000007<br />These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits. However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 10 of this solicitation.<br />For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives<br />INTRODUCTION<br />The Senior Program Operations Specialist is an expert in the multitude of functions that comprise program operations and management for USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives programs in the field and in the U.S. The Senior Program Operations Specialist provides services which require the highest level of professionalism, knowledge, diplomacy, and expertise.

The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."<br />(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).<br />(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:<br />(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;<br />(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and<br />(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.<br />(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible 13 | P a g e<br />Solicitation for a USPSC OTI Senior Program Operations Specialist<br />SOL-OTI-14-000007<br />following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.<br />(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.<br />(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.<br />(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.<br />(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).<br />14 | P a g e<br />Solicitation for a USPSC OTI Senior Program Operations Specialist<br />SOL-OTI-14-000007<br />ATTACHMENT 2<br />FAR 52.222-50 COMBATING TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS (FEB 2009).<br />(a) Definitions.

<DESC>The following questions have been received regarding this solicitation:
<p>1.Q: Will the Government accept parts with a Parts Manufacturer Approval (PMA)?<br />A: As the fuel pump is a Critical Safety Item, no PMA parts will be accepted by the Government. If a contractor wishes to submit a separate Source Approval Request (SAR) package citing PMA parts, that package can be sent to:<br />AFSC/SB<br />Attn: Joe Roop<br />3001 Staff Drive, Ste 1AG85A<br />Tinker AFB, OK 73145<br />joe.roop@us.af.mil<br />However, please be advised that award will not be delayed pending approval of qualification.</p>
<p>2.Q: Does the Government know how many of the 115 fuel pumps will be marked with part number 708400-1, -2, and -3?<br />A: No, the Government does not know what the split of the 115 fuel pumps will be among the three part numbers.</p>
<p>3.Q: Are the fuel pumps sent for remanufacture at regular intervals or only after being damaged in the theater? <br />A: The assets are sent for remanufacture at regular intervals.</p>
<p>4.Q: Can the Government clarify the statement in the Statement of Work 1.2.2, "serialized military parts shall not be co-mingled with or replaced by remanufactured/reconditioned commercial parts?"<br />A: The Government is aware that the F108 engine and this fuel pump exist in the commercial world; however, the Government will only accept military parts for the remanufacture, no commercial parts.</p>
<p>5.Q: Can the Government clarify the difference between "overhaul" and "remanufacture?"<br />A: Overhaul is a service for the restoration of an item to a completely serviceable condition as prescribed by maintenance serviceability standards. The goal is to extend the life of the asset. A remanufacture will include the teardown of an asset to its basic components and insert new parts to make the asset a "like new" condition.</p>

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.  The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Rm 2-1SE3401 Ft Belvoir, VA 22060-5527; Facsimile number (703) 806-8866 or 8875. Packages sent Federal Express or UPS should be addressed to: HQ Army Material Command Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Rm 2-1SE3401 Ft Belvoir, VA 22060-5527. The AMC-Level Protest procedures are found at: http://www.amc.army.mil/pa/COMMANDCOUNSEL.asp.

All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_x] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [x_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_x] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [x_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[x_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government?s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (2) (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to: (A) Change the name in the SAM database; (B) Comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; (C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor?s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov. <BR> <BR>(u) Unauthorized Obligations. (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End Use License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ?I agree? click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ?click-wrap? or ?browse-wrap? agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. (End of Clause) Alternate I (Aug 2012) When a time-and-materials or labor-hour contract is contemplated, substitute the following paragraphs (a), (e), (i), (l), and (m) for those in the basic clause.

Except as otherwise specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this clause, the cost of replacement or correction shall be determined under paragraph (i) of this clause, but the ?hourly rate? for labor hours incurred in the replacement or correction shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit. Unless otherwise specified below, the portion of the ?hourly rate? attributable to profit shall be 10 percent. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance materials and services required to be replaced or corrected without disclosing the former requirement for replacement or correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken. [Insert portion of labor rate attributable to profit.] (5) (i) If the Contractor fails to proceed with reasonable promptness to perform required replacement or correction, and if the replacement or correction can be performed within the ceiling price (or the ceiling price as increased by the Government), the Government may?

(ii) Failure to agree to the amount of increased cost to be charged to the Contractor shall be a dispute under the Disputes clause of the contract. (6) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) above, the Government may at any time require the Contractor to remedy by correction or replacement, without cost to the Government, any failure by the Contractor to comply with the requirements of this contract, if the failure is due to-- (i) Fraud, lack of good faith, or willful misconduct on the part of the Contractor?s managerial personnel; or (ii) The conduct of one or more of the Contractor?s employees selected or retained by the Contractor after any of the Contractor?s managerial personnel has reasonable grounds to believe that the employee is habitually careless or unqualified.

(B) Except as provided for in paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(A) and (D)(2) of this clause, the Government will reimburse the Contractor the actual cost of materials (less any rebates, refunds, or discounts received by the contractor that are identifiable to the contract) provided the Contractor?

It is estimated that the total cost to the Government for the performance of this contract shall not exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule and the Contractor agrees to use its best efforts to perform the work specified in the Schedule and all obligations under this contract within such ceiling price. If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe that the hourly rate payments and material costs that will accrue in performing this contract in the next succeeding 30 days, if added to all other payments and costs previously accrued, will exceed 85 percent of the ceiling price in the Schedule, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer giving a revised estimate of the total price to the Government for performing this contract with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during the performance of this contract, the Contractor has reason to believe that the total price to the Government for performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the then stated ceiling price, the Contractor shall so notify the Contracting Officer, giving a revised estimate of the total price for performing this contract, with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during performance of this contract, the Government has reason to believe that the work to be required in performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the stated ceiling price, the Contracting Officer will so advise the Contractor, giving the then revised estimate of the total amount of effort to be required under the contract.

When and to the extent that the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule has been increased, any hours expended and material costs incurred by the Contractor in excess of the ceiling price before the increase shall be allowable to the same extent as if the hours expended and material costs had been incurred after the increase in the ceiling price.

(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government?s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (2) (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to: (A) Change the name in the SAM database; (B) Comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; (C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor?s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov. <BR> <BR>(u) Unauthorized Obligations. (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End Use License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ?I agree? click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ?click-wrap? or ?browse-wrap? agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. (End of Clause) Alternate I (Aug 2012) When a time-and-materials or labor-hour contract is contemplated, substitute the following paragraphs (a), (e), (i), (l), and (m) for those in the basic clause.

The Government will perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. (2) If the Government performs inspection or tests on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish and shall require subcontractors to furnish all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties.

Except as otherwise specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this clause, the cost of replacement or correction shall be determined under paragraph (i) of this clause, but the ?hourly rate? for labor hours incurred in the replacement or correction shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit. Unless otherwise specified below, the portion of the ?hourly rate? attributable to profit shall be 10 percent. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance materials and services required to be replaced or corrected without disclosing the former requirement for replacement or correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken. [Insert portion of labor rate attributable to profit.] (5) (i) If the Contractor fails to proceed with reasonable promptness to perform required replacement or correction, and if the replacement or correction can be performed within the ceiling price (or the ceiling price as increased by the Government), the Government may?

(6) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) above, the Government may at any time require the Contractor to remedy by correction or replacement, without cost to the Government, any failure by the Contractor to comply with the requirements of this contract, if the failure is due to-- (i) Fraud, lack of good faith, or willful misconduct on the part of the Contractor?s managerial personnel; or (ii) The conduct of one or more of the Contractor?s employees selected or retained by the Contractor after any of the Contractor?s managerial personnel has reasonable grounds to believe that the employee is habitually careless or unqualified. (7) This clause applies in the same manner and to the same extent to corrected or replacement materials or services as to materials and services originally delivered under this contract. <BR> <BR>(8) The Contractor has no obligation or liability under this contract to correct or replace materials and services that at time of delivery do not meet contract requirements, except as provided in this clause or as may be otherwise specified in the contract.

The Government will pay the Contractor as follows upon the submission of commercial invoices approved by the Contracting Officer: (i) Hourly rate.

Fractional parts of an hour shall be payable on a prorated basis. (B) The rates shall be paid for all labor performed on the contract that meets the labor qualifications specified in the contract.

(B) Except as provided for in paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(A) and (D)(2) of this clause, the Government will reimburse the Contractor the actual cost of materials (less any rebates, refunds, or discounts received by the contractor that are identifiable to the contract) provided the Contractor? (1) Has made payments for materials in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice; or (2) Makes these payments within 30 days of the submission of the Contractor?s payment request to the Government and such payment is in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice.

If this is an indefinite delivery contract, the Contracting Officer may insert ?Each order must list separately the elements of other direct charge(s) for that order or, if no reimbursement for other direct costs will be provided, insert ?None?.?] (2) Indirect Costs (Material handling, Subcontract Administration, etc.). The Government will reimburse the Contractor for indirect costs on a pro-rata basis over the period of contract performance at the following fixed price: [Insert a fixed amount for the indirect costs and payment schedule.

(If this is an indefinite delivery contract, the Contracting Officer may insert ?Each order must list separately the fixed amount for the indirect costs and payment schedule or, if no reimbursement for indirect costs, insert ?None?.?] <BR> <BR>(2) Total cost. It is estimated that the total cost to the Government for the performance of this contract shall not exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule and the Contractor agrees to use its best efforts to perform the work specified in the Schedule and all obligations under this contract within such ceiling price. If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe that the hourly rate payments and material costs that will accrue in performing this contract in the next succeeding 30 days, if added to all other payments and costs previously accrued, will exceed 85 percent of the ceiling price in the Schedule, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer giving a revised estimate of the total price to the Government for performing this contract with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during the performance of this contract, the Contractor has reason to believe that the total price to the Government for performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the then stated ceiling price, the Contractor shall so notify the Contracting Officer, giving a revised estimate of the total price for performing this contract, with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during performance of this contract, the Government has reason to believe that the work to be required in performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the stated ceiling price, the Contracting Officer will so advise the Contractor, giving the then revised estimate of the total amount of effort to be required under the contract.

The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose.

(2) "Confidential commercial or financial information" means any business information (other than trade secrets) which is exempt from the mandatory disclosure requirement of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552. Exemptions from mandatory disclosure which may be applicable to business information contained in proposals include exemption (4), which covers "commercial and financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential," and exemption (9), which covers "geological and geophysical information, including maps, concerning wells." (b) If the offeror, or its subcontractor(s), believes that the proposal contains trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, (5 U.S.C. 552), the cover page of each copy of the proposal shall be marked with the following legend: "The information specifically identified on pages ______ of this proposal constitutes trade secrets or confidential commercial and financial information which the offeror believes to be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. The offeror requests that this information not be disclosed to the public, except as may be required by law. The offeror also requests that this information not be used in whole or part by the government for any purpose other than to evaluate the proposal, except that if a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of or in connection with the submission of the proposal, the Government shall have the right to use the information to the extent provided in the contract." (c) The offeror shall also specifically identify trade secret information and confidential commercial and financial information on the pages of the proposal on which it appears and shall mark each such page with the following legend: "This page contains trade secrets or confidential commercial and financial information which the offeror believes to be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act and which is subject to the legend contained on the cover page of this proposal.

Brothers Elizabeth City, NC 27909 NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester&rsquo;s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency&rsquo;s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security United States Coast Guard (CG-9131) Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 FAX: 202.475.3904 The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<p>8. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is (202).372-3695.</p>
<p>9. Questions and quotes shall be emailed to Donald.r.dean@uscg.mil . Contractors are responsible for verifying receipt of quotes.</p>
<p>10. Quotations shall be submitted not later than 0800 Pacific Time on 10JAN2014.</p>

The Contractor shall perform all necessary environmental remediation activities required to meet the performance objectives identified in the Performance Work Statement. The Period of Performance (POP) will be 120 months from date of award.<br /><br />This requirement is to provide a PBR approach for SC involving remedial action efforts at Fairchild Air Force Base, Washington. The PBR initiative has an overarching goal to implement remedies as necessary to protect human health and the environment that maximizes the number of SCs or advance sites as close to SC as practicable during the POP in a cost effective manner. It is desirable to the Government that Life-Cycle Costs (LCC) be reduced. If SC with no new institutional controls is not obtainable within the POP of this effort, the Contractor shall outline the Optimization Exit Strategy (OES) that will be implemented to accomplish SC. The Contractor shall perform all necessary environmental remediation activities required to meet the performance objectives identified in the Performance Work Statement. Reference the latest PWS dated 5 November 2013 and attachments posted to&nbsp;FedBizOpps for the latest documents.<br /><br /><strong>REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL:</strong> <br />The 772 ESS/PKS intends to award a single, Firm Fixed Price (FFP) PBR for remedial action efforts at Fairchild Air Force Base, Washington. Source selection procedures as prescribed in FAR Part 15 and FAR supplements thereto will be followed. The resultant contract is contemplated to be a stand-alone "C" contract with a FFP pricing arrangement. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this Acquisition is 562910. <strong>This requirement is being issued as a 100% Small Business Set-Aside.</strong><br /><br /><strong>Notice to Offeror(s)/Supplier(s):</strong>Funds are not presently available for this effort. No award will be made under this solicitation until funds are available. The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation, either before or after the closing date for receipt of proposals. In the event the Government cancels this solicitation, the Government has no obligation to reimburse an offeror for any costs.<br /><br />The anticipated award of the resultant contract is in the fourth quarter of FY14. The maximum POP for this contract, if all options are exercised, is 120 months from the date of award.
<p>Based on executing the current Air Force environmental restoration strategy, the Air Force's rough order of magnitude (ROM) for this PBR is anticipated to be between $10M and $15M. Offerors will not automatically be non-compliant if the proposed price exceeds the ROM.<br />Proposals shall be submitted in accordance with the RFP requirements and the date indicated in this announcement. <br /><br />Copies of this solicitation are available by INTERNET ACCESS ONLY. All solicitation documents are posted with this announcement and made available for viewing in FedBizOpps (http://www.fbo.gov). Any amendments to the RFP (if required) will be posted in FedBizOpps. Interested parties are reminded that they are responsible for checking FedBizOpps for new information concerning this requirement.<br /><br />Any communications with the Government from the date of this solicitation through contract award shall be directed in writing to the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO), Ms. Linda L. Cavazos. Email correspondence shall be sent to Ms. Cavazos with a copy to the Contract Specialist, Ms. Christina Fernandez.<br /><br /><strong>System for Award Management (SAM) Requirements:</strong>Offerors must be registered in the SAM database. If registration is not complete by date of award, the PCO will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror. Offerors may obtain information on registration at https://www.acquisition.gov.</p>
<p><strong>Environmental Insurance (EI):</strong>The Air Force is currently NOT proposing to require Cleanup Cost Cap (CCC) or any other type of Environmental Insurance (EI) for this PBR.</p>
<strong>Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI):</strong>An organizational conflict of interest may result when factors create an actual or potential conflict of interest on a contract, or where the nature of the work to be performed on the contract creates an actual or potential conflict of interest on a future acquisition. Some restrictions may apply to your firm under the proposed future action. This requirement requires offerors to address OCI issues. In accordance with the parameters set forth in FAR Subpart 9.5, the Contracting Officer must ensure that there are no conflicting roles that might bias a contractor's judgment and must ensure that an OCI does not give rise to an unfair competitive advantage. Performance of past clean-up related work at Fairchild Air Force Base may have created an OCI concerning this PBR effort. OCIs may exist in the following three ways.<br /><br />a. Unequal access to information - access to non-public information that gives a contractor an unfair competitive advantage.<br /><br />b. Biased ground rules - when a contractor has in some sense set the ground rules for another procurement action creating the potential that the contractor may have tilted the playing field in the new competition (usually toward its own strengths and away from its weaknesses).<br /><br />c. Impaired objectivity - when the contract requires exercise of judgment and the <br />independence of its judgment may be affected (e.g., when the contractor may be required to evaluate its own work in a way that could be adverse to its economic interests). Please keep in mind OCI or potential OCI issues your firm (including all subsidiaries, legacy companies, teaming partners, and subcontractors) may have with respect to the scope of effort at these sites.<br /><br />Note: CH2M HILL Constructors, Inc (CH2M HILL) has recently completed conducting investigations and/or focused remedial design pilot testing at two Fairchild Air Force Base Environmental Restoration Program sites under USACE contract W91238-06-D-0013. The two sites represent a significant part of the Fairchild Air Force Base PBR. The following documents have been delivered in draft form and will be posted to the RFP key documents site:
<p>i. Technical Memorandum, Fairchild AFB, Site SS-39 Pre-Design Investigations.</p>
<p>ii. Technical Memorandum, Fairchild AFB Site SS-39 Injection Summary.</p>
<p>However, for site SD-37 (which is included in subject contract and this PBR), CH2M HILL delivered an initial draft technical memorandum that is not sufficient for the Air Force to post at this time. We intend to post some of the associated data attachments to the CH2M HILL Technical Memorandum, Fairchild Air Force Base, Site SD-37 Datagap Investigation and Analysis, however, without the full context of the associated technical memorandum, this presents a conflict of interest where CH2M HILL has access to site investigation not available to other Offerors.<br /><br />CH2M HILL recently completed conducting optimization of&nbsp;Fairchild Air Force Base site LF002 remedy under contract FA4890-06-D-0007-0001. As part of that optimization, CH2M HILL built and operated site Soil Vapor Extraction and In-Situ Chemical Oxidation remedy optimization components. CH2M HILL representatives have stated they have all of the actual construction and operational cost data associated with the remedy optimization components readily available, but have not provided the information in their draft report of the optimization effort. This detailed information will be needed for the Fairchild Air Force Base site LF002 Proposed Plan and Record of Decision Amendment preparation, which is a required task of the PBR. This information has not been provided in a format readily available to other Offerors and therefore, potential Offerors will have to re-create by estimating all of the associated parameters and costs. Based on this, CH2M Hill has a conflict of interest because they have information that is not readily available to other Offerors.<br /><br /><strong>Proprietary Information Shall be Properly Marked by Offerors.</strong> The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations and Source Selection Procedures.</p>

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT to identify sources interested in producing the M201A1 (and variants) pyrotechnic delay fuzes.   <br>    <br>  The Army Contracting Command - Rock Island (ACC-RI) is conducting a market survey of industry to identify sources interested in manufacturing the subject fuzes.   <br>    <br>  TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Fuze, Hand Grenade, M201A1, NSN 1330-00-293-9516, DODIC G874. The M201A1 is a pyrotechnic delay igniting fuze used on M18/M83 smoke grenades and AN-M14 incendiary grenade.  The fuze is equipped with a steel safety Pin and Pull Ring. The safety pin is removed to arm the grenade while holding the lever tight to the grenade body. When the lever is released, the spring-loaded striker rotates and initiates the primer.  The primer ignites a delay element, which initiates the igniter.  The igniter then activates the smoke mix or thermate mix achieving the desired signal, screening effect, and/or heat output.  Variants of the M201A1 fuze include, but are not limited to, the M208 fuze for the M8 smoke pot and M201A1 MOD3 fuze the new SOD-VR smoke grenade.  VARIANT 1:  Fuze, Smoke Pot, M208, NSN 1365-01-564-8799, DODIC K885.  The M208 ignites the smoke mixture within the M8 Floating Smoke Pot.  VARIANT 2: Fuze, Hand Grenade, M201A1 MOD3, NSN 1330-01-603-9230, DODIC GG35.  Like the M208, the M201A1 MOD3 differs only slightly from the M201A1 fuze. The M201A1 MOD3 ignites the burster tube in the M106 SOD-VR grenade. This market survey is for information purposes only to identify sources that are interested in manufacturing any or all of the above components and not a request for proposal or an announcement of a solicitation.  The NAICS code for this item is 332993 with a business size standard of 1500 employees.  Please indicate your business size in your response.   <br>    <br>    <br>  ANTICIPATED REQUIREMENTS:  The following requirements are provided for the purposes of this survey.  Estimated requirements are expected to be from 1.5M to 2.0M fuzes over a five (5) year period to support the Load, Assemble and Pack (LAP) requirements of the government and the order may be split between 2 vendors.  M201A1 requirements comprise well over 95% of the total.  M208 requirements comprise less than 1%.  M201A1 MOD3 requirements will comprise less than 2%.  The work might also include some engineering or product improvement efforts which might arise from technology insertion or standardization requirements.  <br>    <br>  A respondent to this market survey should be able to show that they have adequate technical capability, manufacturing capacity, certification to receive export-controlled technical data (as applicable), and good past performance record in the pyrotechnic processing industry as an indicator of qualifications.    <br>    <br>  EXPORT RESTRICTIONS:  The drawings for this requirement are restricted.

<DESC>This amendment extends the response date for this solicitation to Tuesday, February 11, 2014 at 4:30 PM MT.  Sometime during the week of January 13, VIPR 6.1 will be istalled making the VIPR system unavailable for an estimated day and a half.  You can view the changes made in this update at http://www.fs.fed.us/business/incident/solicitations.php under Solicitation Template Modifications.  A current problem that will be fixed in this update is that when a vendor responds "Yes" to a yes/no question, the Yes shows up in the VIPR application, but the quote and any printed document shows it as "No."  In addition, a new wage determination will be incorporated in this install.  Although none of the wage rates changed, the health and welfare benefit rate increased slightly.  It is currently $3.71/hr, $148.40/wk, $643.07/mo and will increase to $3.81/hr, $152.40/wk, $660.40/mo.  If you have already submitted a quote and don't feel the need to change it, you do not need to re-submit it.  If you have not yet submitted your quote, you might want to wait until VIPR 6.1 has been installed so you are looking at the most current version of the solicitation.

The TB-34() array will use an electro-optical Light Weight Tow Cable (LWTC) to enable the bandwidth required to be sent from the array to the submarine.  The TB-34()s acoustic capability will be processed by the AN/BQQ-10 host sonar system.

<DESC><p><strong>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL</strong></p>
<p>MASTER PLAN within NATIONAL HISTORIC LANDMARK SITE; GSA Design Excellence Solicitation for Lead Planning, Architecture, and Engineering Services (PAE); SOLICITATION: GS11P13MKC0029; REGION: National Capital Region, Washington, DC.; CONTRACTING OFFICER: Mary E. Pineda, (202) 205-8468; CONTRACTING SPECIALIST: Nick Carroll, (202) 205- 0757; PROJECT TYPE:&nbsp; Master Plan (including a Campus Development Plan, Environmental Impact Statement, Cultural Resources Evaluation, and Transportation Management Plan); BUILDING TYPE:&nbsp;Adaptive reuse and new construction within a national historic landmark site; CLIENT AGENCY: U.S. Department of State; <em><strong>REVISED 2/24/2013</strong>&nbsp; </em><em>BUDGET:&nbsp; The total cost should range between $2,000,000 to $2,500,000</em>; GEOGRAPHIC LIMITATION:&nbsp; Nationwide, THIS PROCUREMENT IS OPEN TO SMALL AND LARGE BUSINESS (SEE SUBCONTRACTING REQUIREMENTS UNDER STAGE II HEREIN)</p>
<p>The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), in partnership with the U.S. Department of State (DOS) announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in Master Planning for the Potomac Hill Diplomatic Center (PHDC), a historic federal campus in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood of downtown Washington, DC. This solicitation represents Stage I of a two-stage Design Excellence Program solicitation process.</p>
<p>GSA's Design Excellence Program was instituted to secure top-quality design talent and has led to the development of exceptional achievements in federal workspace development throughout the nation. The program stresses creativity. It also streamlines the way GSA hires Planning, Architecture, and Engineering (PAE) Firms, substantially cutting the cost of competing for GSA contracts.</p>
<p>The Design Excellence Program operates through GSA's Public Buildings Service (PBS). PBS directs the federal government's multibillion-dollar building program, which includes construction, renovation, alteration, and repair of federal office buildings, courthouses, and other facilities. Most of GSA's work is in partnership with PAE groups from the private sector.</p>
<p><strong>PROJECT DESCRIPTION: <br /></strong>The scope of work for PHDC Master Plan requires, at minimum, the successful completion (including regulatory agency approval) of all components required for a multiple scenario Campus Development Plan; Cultural Resources Evaluation (pursuant to Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act); Environmental Impact Statement (pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act); and Transportation Management Plan (pursuant to the policies of the National Capital Planning Commission). The plan is also to include GSA and DOS design standards for secure facilities. <em><strong>REVISED 2/24/2013 </strong>The contract will range in value from $2,000,000 to $2,500,000.</em></p>
<p>PHDC is located at 2300 E Street, NW, Washington, DC 20037. The site consists of two adjoining federally owned parcels, the Navy Hill and Potomac Annex properties (NOTE: Site Drawing attached herein under&nbsp;ATTACHMENT A - SITE DRAWING). Together, these properties compose a single, 11.8-acre campus that was deeded to the federal government in the 1790s. The site is home to the first Naval Observatory and the original headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency. Mid-19th and early 20th Century buildings populate the campus today, which is bound by 23rd Street, NW to the east; the U.S. Institute of Peace property to the south; and the E Street, NW off ramp of the E Street Expressway to the west and north.</p>
<p>With DOS headquarters (2201 C Street, NW) and the U.S. Institute of Peace (2301 Constitution Avenue, NW) immediately adjacent to the site, and DOS'sneed for additional federally owned office space, GSA is currently working with DOS to transform the Potomac Annex and Navy Hill properties into a single, state-of-the-art federal campus, where history meets innovation and modernization. The campus is envisioned to serve the long-term needs of DOS and minimize the agency's real estate expenses by transitioning employees now housed in private office buildings to this federally owned site. The exact number of employees to relocate will depend on the development potential of PHDC as determined through the planning process. Therefore, a major objective of this project will be to develop a Master Plan that maximizes the full development potential of the site while meeting all regulatory obligations and Design Excellence Program standards.</p>
<p>There are eight existing office buildings located throughout the campus (three currently occupied by DOS and five vacant that are now undergoing renovation) and portions of open space that may be suitable for future development. The PHDC Master Plan will address the needs of GSA and DOS through phased development of PHDC and will turn upon such items as usable land areas, appropriate densities, highest and best use, and cultural, environmental, transportation, and regulatory constraints.</p>
<p>The PHDC Master Plan will lay the foundation for the development of a world-class federal campus that preserves the cultural legacy of the site and responds to the development needs of the Government in the modern era and beyond. The campus should complement and contribute to surrounding public and private land uses and bring unity to the federal presence in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>PHDC is listed on the District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites and is eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district. The original Naval Observatory is already designated a National Historic Landmark. <br /><br /><strong>Scope of Services Overview<br /></strong>In general terms, the scope of services will include:</p>

Authority:  <br>  <br> 	Action using simplified acquisition procedures:  FAR 13.106-1(b) (1): For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold (SAT), contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g. urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand name, or industrial mobilization).  <br>  <br> Reasons for Authority Cited:  :  Justification for Sole Source for a ATC Tooling Remanufacturing Replace is standardization, the Department of Defense (DOD), Defense Standardization Program DoD 4120.24 Chapter #3  <br> Subsection C3.4. Standardization Considerations for Buying Commands offers guidance on questions that buying commands should ask and if the answer is  quote mark Yes quote mark  for any of the questions then standardization should be considered.  And the answer is  quote mark Yes quote mark  for Questions C3.4.5 and C3.4.6 (See attached).   <br>  <br> Currently ATC has a patent for the existing fixtures and is the only source of supply for remanufacturing and replacement of existing parts . There is no other manufactures able ot supply the required manufacture and parts for these fixtures. This procurement is required to maintain the existing fixtures and should be urgently awarded .  Without the fixtures, the Advance Metal Finishing Facility would be required to plate using the old stick-anode method doubling plating times and increasing masking time by approximately 500%. <br>  <br> 5.	Fair and Reasonable Price Determination:  As Contracting Officer, I hereby determine that the anticipated cost to the Government for this contract action will be fair and reasonable. Basis for the determination will be the Contractors quoted price and previous contractor pricing from previous awards. <br>  <br> 6.	Contracting Officer's Approval:  I hereby certify that this justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.  Based on the foregoing, I approve this sole source justification subject to availability of funds, and provided that the services and supplies herein described have otherwise been authorized for acquisition.  <br>

<DESC>This request is for a follow-on six month short term contract to Spectrum Healthcare Resources, Inc. (CAGE:  061T0), to provide six months of Ultrasound and Mammography Technician Services at Bassett Army Community Hospital (BACH), Fort Wainwright, Alaska for the period of 01 February 2014 through 31 July 2014.  This contract will be a firm-fixed priced award and will mirror the current Task Order (W91YU-09-F-0011).  There will be no option period or an extension of services.  This six month short term interim contract is vital to cover Technician Services in the Radiology Department during the conversion to General Schedule (GS) on both positions.  They are currently on the Table of Distribution and Allowances (TDA) and the bridge will ensure services during the GS conversion.  By continuing services with the current Contractor, who already has well qualified/working providers, the government will continue to receive these uninterrupted critical services.  The estimated value of this acquisition is $122,857.00.  Please see the attached J&A for additional details.
