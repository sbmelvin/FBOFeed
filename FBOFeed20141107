<DESC>This pre-solicitation notice is to provide a DRAFT Request for Proposal (RFP) for the Operationally Responsive Space (ORS) - 5 Launch Services. The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) Operationally Responsive Space Office (ORSO) intends to release a solicitation for a competitive Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) contract to obtain Launch Services for the ORS-5 mission. The required Launch Services are described in the draft RFP.<br />In accordance with FAR Part 15.201, Exchanges with Industry before Receipt of Proposals, the Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) Operationally Responsive Space Office (ORSO) is pleased to provide copies of the draft RFP for the ORS-5 Launch Services program. This draft RFP is provided to assist prospective offerors in the planning and development of proposals for future submission pending release of the final version.
<p>The information in this draft pre-solicitation is subject to change prior to release of the final RFP. The final RFP is scheduled to be released in early 2015. The North American Industry Classification System Code is 336414. It is the responsibility of the prospective contractors to be familiar with the applicable clauses and provisions.</p>
<p>ORSO is encouraging industry input, comments, and questions from all interested companies.

All responsible sources may submit offers which shall be considered if received timely.</p>
<p>-------- IMPORTANT NOTICE: NEW REQUIREMENT --------</p>
<p>Due to a DOD regulation requiring "identity certificates" when accessing DOD computer systems, VIM-ASAP (https://vim.dla.mil) will soon become Common Access Card (CAC) enabled. This means that in order to access the system a company representative must have an ECA Certificate. There is a cost involved in obtaining a certificate (approximately $125.00 to $150.00 per year per certificate). VIM is scheduled to begin using the new logon from 8/23/2013 through 9/30/2013. After that date, no one may log on using the old user ID and password.</p>
<p>DoDI 8520.2 Mandates the use of DoD PKI identity certificates when accessing DoD information systems. The DoD established the External Certification Authority (ECA) program to support the issuance of DoD- approved certificates to industry partners and other external entities and organizations. ECA certificates enable contractors to securely communicate with the DoD and authenticate themselves to DoD Information Systems. ECA Certificates are individually issued digital identity credentials. The DoD relies upon these credentials to ensure the identity of the user in online environments or when a certificate holder tries accessing DoD Information Systems.</p>
<p>The following are the three entities authorized by the DoD to issue ECA Certificates. Review and apply for an ECA Certificate from one of the below organizations to access your VIM account:<br />1. IdenTrust: http://www.identrust.com/certificates/eca/index.html<br />2. ORC (Operational Research Consultants): http://eca.orc.com/<br />3. VeriSign: https://eca.verisign.com/</p>
<p>There are three types of certificates: Medium Assurance, Medium Token Assurance, Medium Hardware Assurance. If one person always signs in from the same computer they can use the Medium Assurance which gets loaded to a hard drive. If one person logs on from different computers they should use the Medium Token Assurance which is portable, similar to a thumb drive. Only one person can use an ECA certificate. Each user will need their own. Each person who needs to access the system will need one.<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Availability of solicitations: FAR 5.102(d) applies, as our office no longer issues solicitations or amendments in paper form. <br />Interested offerors can obtain a copy of the solicitation after the issuance date at: https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/. Detailed system requirements and instructions for registration can be found on the DLA DIBBS home page accessed on https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/. A few highlights of the information that will be found include: 1. On the DLA Internet Bulletin Board System (DIBBS) home page, click the VENDOR REGISTRATION link to begin the registration process. 2. In order to register for access to secure portions of DLA DIBBS, the company you are representing must already be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) system. 3. A Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code registration will be processed immediately. A User ID will appear on the registration screen and a password will be sent separately to the email address of the Super User. If a CAGE is already registered on DLA DIBBS, the name and email address of the Super User will be provided. The Super User should be contacted to set-up additional accounts, logons and passwords for their CAGE. DIBBS Super User * If your CAGE has already been registered on DIBBS, the name and email address of the person designated as your super user will be provided. * The representative who starts the DIBBS registration process has the option to accept their CCR registration POC as the DIBBS super user, or they can designate themselves or another person to act as the super user for the CAGE. * The super user acts as the account administrator for a CAGE. They can add up to ninety-eight additional users, provide user IDs and passwords, modify existing users, and control the login status of each user for their CAGEs through My Account (Account Maintenance).<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------DLA Troop Support has developed a web-based system that allows manufacturers the ability to request specifications, patterns and drawings on our contracting page. To request technical data for DLA Troop Support Clothing and Textiles solicitations, use the following link to the DLA Troop Support C&amp;T Technical Data Repository area at http://www.troopsupport.dla.mil/Portal/sreqfrm.aspx.<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Defense appropriations and authorization acts and other statutes (including what is commonly referred to as "The Berry Amendment") impose restrictions on the DoD's acquisition of foreign products and services. Generally, Clothing and Textile items (as defined in DFARS clause 252.225-7012) and "specialty metals" (as defined in DFARS clause 252.225-7014), including the materials and components thereof (other than sensors, electronics, or other items added to, and not normally associated with clothing), must be grown, reprocessed, reused, melted or produced in the United States, its possessions or Puerto Rico, unless one of the DFARS 225.7002-2 exceptions applies.</p>

This is a market survey requesting a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) for the development of training in accordance with Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 121 Operations Requirements for Supplemental Course Curriculum for FAA initial and recurrent pilot training for the following type of aircraft: Beechcraft 300/350 with ProLine 21 Avionics, Learjet-60, Challenger CL-601-r, Challenger CL-604 and CL-605 aircraft.   The ROM shall include the cost of developing a 14 CFR Part 121 supplemental training program to meet the needs of the Performance Work Statements (PWS) attached along with how the needs will be met, i.e. simulator or dry lease. The responses to this market survey ROM will be used for informational purposes only.  This is not a screening information request but a request for estimated cost in developing a 14 CFR Part 121 Supplemental Training Program versus the current 14 CFR Part 135 Training Program FIS currently uses.  The FAA is looking to see if there are commercial sources that can provide the development of and training services required.

The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey.  Therefore, any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendors expense.

At this time, the nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.

The purpose of this market survey is to solicit ROMs from both large and small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and 8(a) certified firms, capable of providing FAA initial and recurrent pilot training for the type of aircraft identified above under one contract. 

This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms.

The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 611512, Flight Training with a size standard of 25.5M.   

Interested firms are required to submit the attached Business Declaration form and a copy of their SBA 8(a) certification letter, if applicable.

In order to make this determination the FAA requires the following from interested vendors:

1. Capability Statement - This document should identify:
       a. Type of services provided by your firm, 
       b. Size and type of services provided by previous contracts (elaborate and provide detailed information and past performance), 
      	c. Number of years in business
	
2.  Geographical areas where your company can provide services.

3.  Expected programmatic approach (in-house, teaming, subcontracting, etc.) - Respondents must provide their strategy for accomplishing this work, including the percentage of work that will be done by eligible small, service-disabled veteran-owned  and 8(a) certified businesses if any.  

Attached is a copy of the current 135 PWS and a draft PWS of our end product 121 Supplemental Training requirement.  Respondents are encouraged to review the performance work statements and provide comments or possible alternatives to consider. 

All responses to this market survey must be received by December 8, 2014 at 3:00pm CST.   All submittals should be submitted to:

<DESC>The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Division of Intramural Population Health Research (DIPHR) intends to solicit proposals to award a Research and Development (R&amp;D) contract to an organization to obtain services of sonology expertise capable of using available technology to catalogue and perform 2D and 3D measurement of previously collected obstetrical ultrasound images in an existing bank of singleton and twin gestations.  There is a paucity of data on longitudinal changes in fetal body composition (subcutaneous fat, lean mass) and visceral volumes over the course of pregnancy. This data gaps contrasts sharply with available imaging technology. Knowledge of longitudinal changes in fetal body composition and visceral volumes during pregnancy has the potential for practical scientific and clinical use given that current management of many pregnancy complications is limited because the degree of severity that results in adverse outcomes remains uncertain. Moreover, given reported differences in birth size characteristics by maternal race, we will be able to use data from a prospective pregnancy cohort design with longitudinal measurements (2D and 3D) to assess body composition changes and visceral measurements for the 4 maternal racial groups.<br /><br />The anticipated contract type will be a Research and Development cost reimbursement contract with a base and two options over a three year period of performance.   The Base Period, Option Period 1, and Option Period 2 will be for 12 months each.  The RFP is anticipated to be posted on or about November 24, 2014 on FedBizOpps (FBO) website:  http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  The due date for submission of proposals in response to the RFP is anticipated to be on or about January 12, 2015.  Information in the anticipated RFP supersedes any information in this pre-solicitation announcement.  This acquisition has been designated as a full and open competition under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541712.  Any questions concerning this announcement must be submitted in writing to Ryan Hash at ryan.hash@nih.gov, Contract Specialist or addressed to NICHD Contracts Management Branch, Office of Acquisitions, NICHD, NIH, 6100 Executive Blvd., Room 7A07, MSC 7510 Bethesda, Md.  20892-7510 (if hand-delivered or sending by delivery service - use Rockville, MD and Zipcode 20852.

Are the described service areas and the capabilities required clearly defined?</p>
<p>4. What changes, additions, updates, and clarifications would you suggest?</p>
<p>5. Do you provide RHEL Linux as a part of IaaS offerings? What Open Source Linux operating Systems do you offer as part of your IaaS offering?</p>
<p>6. How would you suggest pricing this requirement? What is the best practice for Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) structure and pricing? Do you offer any volume discounts?<br /> <br />7. The IGCE for this requirement is not yet finalized; however, it is estimated that the ID/IQ ceiling could be as high as $9.9M for NOAA.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to negotiate and award a Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP), sole source contract with General Nucleonics Inc. (GN) in Pomona, CA for the replacement of Inflight Blade Inspection System (IBIS) safety covers on the CH-53 and MH-53 Heavy Lift Helicopter. The covers will resolve a potential hazard triggered by extreme pressure when utilizing the IBIS. The Contractor is expected to produce approximately 3,054 covers for delivery to the Government in FY15.
<p>This action is being awarded on a sole source basis to GN in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements." Due to the radioactive Strontium 90 element inside of the IBIS, GN will not qualify the IBIS 'safe for use' in accordance with its license by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission if another source is used to provide the IBIS cover. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, responsible sources may submit a capability statement, which will be considered by NAVAIR. Questions concerning contracting opportunities should be directed to Mr. Jonathan Mauro at (301) 757-5285.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Testing and Advanced Technology Division (TATD), National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL), Ann Arbor, Michigan, requires a complete test system for performing mid-range engine testing. These test systems will produce data of highest precision and accuracy with a high level of certainty, in a manner that can be comprehensively demonstrated and documented.  The acquisition of this Commercial item will be subject to Full and Open Competition and will be processed in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334519 Other Measuring and Controlling Device Manufacturing with a size standard of 500 employees.
EPA seeks a test cell that will be used for engine compliance testing to support EPA's compliance activities.  The engines to be tested are primarily nonroad diesel engine applications, and are used in agriculture equipment, construction equipment, and generators in the 30 to 150 kW range.  These engines are regulated under 40 CFR, part 1039, Control of Emissions from New and In-Use Nonroad Compression - Ignition Engines.  Part 1039 requires the use of 40 CFR, part 1065 for the testing procedures.  The test site will be designed for engines meeting the Nonroad Tier 4 emissions standards.  The primary usage of the test cell will be for nonroad engines, however, 2010 or later on-highway engines could also be tested.
This requirement is for a complete integrated engine test cell.  There are seven major systems included in this procurement: 1. Automation System; 2. Engine Dynamometers; 3. Emission Sampler, CVS and PM measurement; 4. Analytical Systems; 5. Intake Air Measurement; 6. Fuel System (Option); 7. Cooling Systems (Option).

All non-price evaluation criteria, when combined, are significantly more important than price.  Anticipated non-price evaluation criteria include demonstrated ability of the proposed system to meet or exceed the SOW requirements; past performance record under comparable contracts; and relevant previous experience.  The solicitation should be issued on or about December 9, 2014 on FedConnect.net.

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Market Research Request for Information</strong></p>
<p><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Instructions:</span></strong></p>
<p>Attached is the initial "DRAFT" VISA contingency contract solicitation with updated regulatory requirements and liner and charter terms and conditions for the FY16 renewal. Within, for every requirement, term or condition, comments are provided to the side of the text detailing the changes, if any. This initial draft is not all inclusive and merges the previous separate contracts common liner and charter terms and conditions (T&amp;C's) under a general T&amp;C section as well as segregates specific liner and charter T&amp;C's as appropriate. The charter T&amp;C's within are solid requirements based upon current charter contract requirements. However, the specific liner T&amp;C's are not included and are being revised based upon known changes since 2005 and validated to coincide with current Universal Services Contract (USC) liner requirements as applicable. Over the next several weeks, further requests for industry input will be requested on the historical VISA contingency contract requirements to include relevancy of recommended liner T&amp;C's from USC, how to best price the contingency contract, and preferences regarding Rate Methodologies (Revenue Based, Peacetime and Negotiated) for worldwide contingency application.</p>
<p>Please review the solicitation in its entirety and provide comments, concerns, issues and/or recommendations for consideration and discussion for the final RFP. Submit your initial VISA draft solicitation comments by 12 Dec 2014 via email to Melinda Lewis (melinda.j.lewis9.civ@mail.mil), Dave Hoag (david.m.hoag.civ@mail.mil), and Nick Weiss (nicholas.e.weiss.civ@mail.mil).</p>
<p>In addition, we plan to host an industry day with all interested carriers to further discuss the VISA contingency contract, recommended changes and way forward. For planning purposes, we are targeting a day during the week of 8 December 2014.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose:</span></strong></p>
<p>VISA's purpose is to provide a responsive transition from peace to Contingency operations through pre-coordinated agreements for sealift capacity to support DOD Contingency requirements. VISA establishes procedures for the commitment of intermodal shipping services/systems to satisfy such requirements. Accordingly, the contingency contracts need to be renewed to keep current.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background:</span></strong></p>
<p>The VISA program is a partnership between the U.S. Government and the maritime industry to provide the DoD with "assured access" to commercial sealift and intermodal capacity to support the emergency deployment and sustainment of U.S. military forces. The VISA program was put in place and is owned by Department of Transportation's Maritime Administration (MARAD). The VISA program is authorized under the Maritime Administration's authorities under the Defense Production Act of 1950, and the Maritime Security Act of 2003, and was approved as a DOD commercial sealift readiness program on January 30, 1997. The VISA program provides for a time-phased activation of state-of-the-art commercial intermodal equipment to coincide with DOD requirements while minimizing disruption to U.S. commercial operations. MARAD recently extended the VISA program to October 2019.</p>
<p>The key component of VISA has been pre-negotiated contracts between DOD and VISA Participants, providing DOD assured access to commercial sealift capacity to meet national defense contingency or emergency requirements. As initially designed, three DOD contracts accomplished VISA Drytime Charter and Ocean Liner Distribution Service objectives: the VISA Enrollment Contract (VEC), the VISA Contingency Contract (VCC) and the Drytime Contingency Contract (DCC). Multiple DOD Components were involved in awarding and administering these multiple contracts. To participate, a company was required to execute multiple contracts (one DCC per vessel, one VCC per carrier) with multiple DOD Components. Reorganization within DOD placed responsibility for sealift contingency contracting in a single organization, USTRANSCOM.<br /><br />Originally, the initial VISA liner vessel contracts were established in SDDC and charter vessel contracts were established in MSC. Both sets of contingency contracts were transferred to USTRANSCOM for adminstration in 2007 and 2011 respectively. On 1 Oct 2013, the charter and liner contingency contracts were extended and consolidated into a single USTRANSCOM agreement in which carriers agreed to a single contract identifying all vessels without any changes to the existing rates, terms and conditions. On 1 Oct 2014, the VISA contingency contracts were extended to 30 Sep 2015 for a 10th and final year of obligation and performance per statute.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Scope:</span></strong></p>
<p>The scope of the renewed USTRANSCOM VISA Contingency Contract is to re-establish the combined VISA charter and liner requirements, update vessel capacity enrollment terms, add, remove and/or update current FAR, DFAR, and USTRANSCOM regulatory requirements, add, delete, and/or revise previous charter and liner terms and conditions to coincide with current and/or similar contract terms and conditions for existing contracted charter and liner services, and eliminate any redundancies.<br /><br />In general, most of the VISA contingency contract revisions are minor. However, of interest is new Cyber Security and Facility Clearance requirements. In addition, prior to proceeding with a final VISA Request for Proposals (RFP), a meeting will be scheduled for industry to provide comments on the existing rate methodologies, recommend CLIN/rate structures on how best to price the contract as well as to provide an opportunity for an industry day to discuss recommended or revised liner and charter contract terms and conditions as detailed in the draft solicitation.</p>
<p><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Milestones:</span></strong></p>
<p>-- Socialize VISA Solicitation Changes with industry (Nov-Dec 2014) <br />-- Issue Final Solicitation for Request for Proposal (RFP) (Feb 2015)<br />-- Award VISA Contingency Contracts effective 1 Oct 2015 (Aug-Sep 2015)</p>

<DESC>The Great Lakes Acquisition Center, on behalf of the Captain James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center (FHCC), intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Cardiothoracic & Vascular Surgical Associates, S.C., Oak Lawn, IL, for after-hours on-call Cardiac Surgeon coverage and clinic services. The anticipated period of performance will be January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015. The contractor shall provide 24/7 on-call cardiothoracic/vascular surgeon services to the FHCC and one, two-hour clinic per week, as well as other elective surgical procedures for the FHCC. Providers are required to be board certified cardiovascular surgeons or board certified cardiothoracic surgeons trained in cardiovascular surgery. The on-call provider shall contact the FHCC within 15 minutes of being notified to provide assessment of the patient's condition. Should the patient's condition require the physical presence of the on-call provider, they shall report to the FHCC within 30 minutes of being notified. The contractor shall also come to the FHCC when necessary to make rounds and document in the electronic medical record their treatment as well as follow up on results from diagnostic studies (labs, imaging, etc.,) and medications that have been ordered or require follow up. Contractor shall be available to the FHCC to perform or assist in thoracic and vascular procedures on appropriate cases either at the FHCC or an off-site facility. All patient consults and new admissions will be seen within 24 hours or sooner as required by the patient's clinical condition. These services require more than one provider to be performing under the contract. Additionally, individual physicians are not allowed to provide concurrent on-call services to the FHCC and another entity. 
To the best of our knowledge, Cardiothoracic & Vascular Surgical Associates (CVSA) is the only company that is able to provide uninterrupted on-call services to the FHCC. Cardiothoracic & Vascular Surgical Associates, S.C. has Board Certified Cardiac Surgeons on staff, who are currently credentialed and privileged at the FHCC and have an adjudicated Access National Agency Check and Inquiries (ANACI) Background Investigation. Additionally, these surgeons hold clinical privileges at an off-site facility where cardiac surgeries that cannot be performed at the FHCC may be performed without a break in treatment as the CVSA surgeons can assess the patient's condition at the FHCC and perform the surgical procedure at an off-site facility.  
The authority permitting other than full and open competition for this procurement is 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1) Only one responsible source and no other supplies/services will satisfy agency requirements.  This authority is cited and justification made based on the determination that the Government's minimum needs can be best satisfied by services available from one source. The NAICS code for this requirement is 621111.
This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. No solicitation documents are available and telephone requests will not be honored. However, if a firm believes it is capable of performing these services, the following information must be provided to the Contracting Officer:
1.	CV/Resume of proposed physicians
2.	Copies of providers' licenses and any certifications (BLS/ACLS)
3.	Description of the company's background and capability to perform the required services.  Include an explanation and example a potential call schedule.
4.	Hourly Rate for Weekday on-call services.
5.	Hourly Rate for Weekend on-call services.
6.	Hourly Rate for Call-back services.
7.	Identification of off-site facility(s) where providers hold clinical privileges to perform surgeries. 
8.	Proof of completed ANACI for proposed providers or statement indicating all providers will submit to ANACI Background Investigation.

Army Enterprise System Integration Program (AESIP) is acting as the lead office and any task orders issued under the contract will support specific requirements of PM AESIP, PM Global Combat Support System (GCSS-Army), General Fund Enterprise Business Systems (GFEBS) and Logistics Modernization Program (LMP). <br>  <br> INTRODUCTION: Ms. Molly B. Condon, Contract Specialist, Army Contracting Command - Rock Island (ACC-RI) on behalf of Project PM AESIP, under the Program Executive Office, Enterprise Information Systems (PEO EIS), is conducting market research for Global Combat Support System-Army (GCSS-Army). <br>  <br> This SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT seeks to identify potential sources capable of providing the required SAP services. <br>  <br> BACKGROUND <br> Description:  <br>  <br> Global Combat Support System, Army (GCSS-Army) is conducting market research, seeking potential sources for vendors with performance capabilities to provide strategic, operational, and sustainment data management in the logistics and financial domains that are not covered under existing system integration contract.  The services being acquired are for support of commercial item - SAP Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software already deployed and utilized in GCSS-Army.   <br>  <br> Part 1.0 GCSS-Army Data Management Consulting Vendor Requirements <br> a.  Vendor must have DoD security Site Clearance <br> b.  Vendor personnel must be U.S. citizens and have National Agency Check with Law and Credit (NACLC) clearance minimum and Common Access Card (CAC); personnel requiring direct NEC-R access will need active Secret clearance <br> c.  Vendor must have  quote mark reach-back quote mark  capability to SAP for support as needed <br> d.  Vendor complementary software must be certified by SAP <br> e.  Any Vendor network software must have NETCOM certificate of net worthiness (CoN) and be provided free-of-charge if in lieu of current software already licensed by the Army; and training delivered expeditiously. <br> f.  Vendor and software should have favorable Gartner and/or Forrester ratings, or comparable endorsement by a Government agency <br> g.  Vendor must have full Data Management Lifecycle experience on at least one large (25K+ users) SAP implementation and at least three (3) additional qualifications from Government and/or Aerospace & Defense, Logistics, and Financial clients <br> h.  Vendor must have a proven methodology consistent with DAMA Data Management Body of Knowledge (DAMA DMBOK)  <br> i.  Vendor personnel must have relevant Data Management experience and certifications <br> j.  Vendor personnel must have training and experience with Data Migration and Data Steward Accelerator software used by GCSS-Army; training is at Vendor's own expense <br> k.  The work locations are Primary: Petersburg & Midlothian VA; Secondary: Northern VA Capitol Region, Huntsville, AL, or Picatinny, NJ; all at Government per diem rates. <br> l.  Vendor must be able to collaborate with the GCSS-Army Lead System Integrator and other Army organizations, e.g. Enterprise Data Management Office (EDMO), Logistics Support Activity (LOGSA), and Army Centralized Business Analytics (ACBA) <br>  <br> Part 2.0 Work to be Performed - SAP Data Management Services, FY 15 and 16 <br> 	 <br>   a. Background:  GCSS-Army has a need for SAP Data Management Services providing strategic, operational, and sustainment data management in the logistics and financial domains.  <br>  <br>   b. Scope: The GCSS-Army solution is experiencing difficulties with data quality due to deficiencies with legacy Standard Army Management Information System (STAMIS) systems, external data sources, Production System quality management, and insufficient LSI procedures (Data Stewardship), which must be addressed.  The success of GCSS-Army fielding centers on the quality and completeness of data preparation during the initial stages of cutting over from legacy systems.   This is a very intense process that incrementally transitions individual Army units to GCSS-Army during the period of performance.   The beginning of sustainment will overlap with the two fielding waves. GCSS-Army is dependent on the accuracy, completeness, relevance and readiness of its ERP data.   <br>  <br> In addition, the data from the individual commands and Army/DoD authoritative data sources (ADS) must be rationalized against the existing GCSS-Army data requirements and business rules.   The Government must cover the data quality requirement during fielding with contractor support until a long-term sustainment organization is deployed.  A centralized data governance process that identifies data cleansing opportunities and provides metrics on data quality and readiness is required.  Also, a centralized system to govern creation and updating enterprise data, with the ability to track and audit changes, is required to manage the data across the Army Enterprise.  An area where these capabilities are most critical is Equipment data, where GCSS-Army has been identified as the Army's Enterprise Equipment Master ADS. <br>  <br> Services are required to accomplish comprehensive data management and transition it to the Government.   <br>    <br>   c. Objectives:  To request information from SAP service providers capable of providing the expected level of work, possessing the required technical expertise and having the ability to perform the work in the time period required.   <br>  <br>   d.

INTRODUCTION <br><br>Fort Leonard Wood (FLW), a U.S. Army garrison, located in South Central Missouri is requesting, via this Request for Interest (RFI), responses from suppliers of electricity interested in submitting a proposal for full requirements power supply to FLW.  <br><br>The purpose of the RFI is to solicit information from qualified electrical suppliers to ascertain availability of capacity and interest in supplying FLW's electrical needs.  <br><br>Please note that an expression of interest in providing this energy product is neither binding nor promissory.  Responses will be used for planning purposes in determining available resources for firming Fort Leonard Wood's electrical needs.  Additionally, failure to respond to this RFI does not preclude the ability to respond to any future Request for Proposals (RFPs) for the purchase of energy products if issued at a later date.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes; it does not constitute an RFP or a promise to issue an RFP at a later date.  This RFI does not commit FLW to contract for any supply or service, nor is FLW seeking contract proposals at this time.  Responders are advised that FLW will not pay any cost incurred in response to this RFI and that all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested responder's expense.<br> <br>In light of the amount of time required for respondents to provide such information and for FLW to evaluate it, a decision as to whether to proceed with an RFP cannot be expected prior to January 2012.  <br>2. DESCRIPTION OF REQUEST: <br><br>FLW is issuing this RFI in an effort to solicit interest in the provision of wholesale, firm full-requirements energy supply, and corresponding capacity and ancillary services.  The requested power will be delivered to an interconnection or interface on the Associated Electric Cooperative, Inc. (AECI) system border.  AECI is a consumer-owned rural electric generation and transmission cooperative that provides transmission service over facilities located in the States of Missouri, Iowa and Oklahoma.  A copy of the Transmission Service Agreement between AECI and FLW is attached as Attachment 1.  AECI will provide transmission service from the AECI border to Sho-Me Power Electric Cooperative (Sho-Me).  Sho-Me will deliver the electric power from its interface with AECI to FLW.  FLW has a transmission service agreement with Sho-Me for the delivery of power.<br><br>AECI will provide to FLW, through their Open Access Transmission Tariff, two ancillary services (Scheduling, System Control and Dispatch Service and Reactive Supply, and Voltage Control from Generation or Other Sources Service).  Suppliers responding to this RFI must document how they intend to provide the other ancillary services (Regulation and Frequency Response Service, Energy Imbalance Service, Operating Reserve-Spinning Service, Operation Reserve-Supplemental Service, and Generator Imbalance Service).  Responders must have the capability, and should identify how they intend to forecast and schedule FLW's load, whether dynamically or in hourly blocks, and provide associated ancillary services. All projected costs for providing these services must be broken out and included in your response.  <br><br>Supply will begin January 1, 2013.  However, for planning purposes it is necessary to have an agreement in place no later than June 30, 2012. FLW is targeting a contract term between 1 and 5 years in length.  Over the most recent 12-months, FLW had a peak demand of 55 MW and consumed approximately 244,000 MWh.  Attachment 2 shows the monthly demands (kW), energy consumption (kWh) and load factors for the 12 month period ending September 30, 2011.  The expected demand in 2013 is 65 MW with a 5% annual load growth for each year through 2017.<br><br>FLW, as a U.S. government entity, is subject to certain policy mandates governing its purchase and use of electricity, specifically renewable energy.  Therefore, respondents to this RFI should identify how they intend to assist FLW in meeting the target of sourcing at least 7.5% of its annual electricity needs from renewable resources, per the Federal Energy Policy Act-2005. <br>3.  ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS:<br><br>As indicated above, AECI and Sho-Me Power will provide transmission service from the AECI border to FLW.  AECI and Sho-Me will bill FLW for said transmission service. Thus these services should not be included as part of your submission.  <br>  <br>Alternative proposals to meet the installations energy requirements are welcomed. However, any alternative proposals must fully explain the rationale and include a cause & effect (pros/cons) statement associated with applying the alternative.  <br><br><br>4.  RFI SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: <br><br>In addition to being able to successfully provide the above-mentioned power supply attributes, all responses to this RFI must meet the following requirements to be considered:<br><br>1.	Please provide a description of your company, specifically identifying the legal entity that would be contracting under a potential agreement.<br><br>2.	Please indicate the long-term debt rating (S&P, Moody and/or Fitch) of the legal entity that would be acting as the contracting party in this transaction.  If such information is not available, please provide other financial information, including D&B number or audited financials, which would be sufficient to evaluate the financial standing of the contracting party.<br><br>3.	Please include a description of the types of products that will be offered to meet FLW's energy requirements, such as on-peak/off-peak energy blocks, index pricing and fixed pricing.  Also, provide a description of the flexibility that will be available under the pricing options, such as required notice for purchasing blocks, sell back of excess block energy purchased and the index that will be used for pricing for market purchases. <br><br>4.	Please provide sample contracts for all product types offered, specifying standard terms and conditions.<br><br>5.	Please include contact name, address, phone number, fax number and e-mail address for communications regarding this RFI.<br><br>6.	Please provide indicative pricing for each term and product offered, including the effect on pricing of meeting FLW's renewable energy goals.  As discussed above pricing for terms from one to five years is desireable.<br><br><br>5.  PROCESS AND TIMING: <br><br>1.

<DESC>The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) is seeking information on how an interested contractor could provide fully automated closed caption videos for NGATube.
<p>The purpose of this request for Information (RFI) is to gain information on current industry practices that would meet NGA's requirement. NGA requires closed captioning for our videos on NGATube, the intranet video streaming site that resides on our closed and classified internal intranet system. NGA is also requesting closed captioning of live footage that is being fed to NGATube and other closed circuit televisions throughout the agency. The system does not have any outside access to the Internet. The end goal is to identify possible software solutions that will fully automate closed captioning of videos with minimal human intervention.</p>

This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, NGA at this time is not seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI - all costs associated with this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Aircraft Operations Center (AOC), located at MacDill AFB, FL intends to issue a solicitation for Multi-Mode Radar Systems for use in the NOAA WP-3D Orion aircraft which will satisfy the mission requirements.
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background</span></p>
<p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) instruments, maintains, and operates aircraft in support of a variety of meteorological and oceanographic research projects. Two of AOC's aircraft are WP-3D Orions (a variant of the Lockheed P-3C), manufactured in the 1970's. Each aircraft is equipped with a custom, horizontally scanning weather radar system, with the antenna mounted in an oblate spheroid radome under the fuselage. Commonly referred to as the Lower Fuselage (or L/F) radar, the system was originally installed in 1977. Several components (antenna, drive motor and magnetron transmitter) are from the original installation and are becoming difficult or cost prohibitive to repair. NOAA/AOC is considering alternatives to replace the current L/F radar system with a commercially available system. In addition to providing weather radar data, other modes are desired to meet future mission requirements not within the current system capabilities.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Potential Missions and Associated Capabilities</span></p>
<p>Hurricane and other Severe Weather Reconnaissance - Weather radar mode to provide in-flight situational awareness, and scientific quality reflectivity and velocity measurements for post-flight analysis. Air to Air mode to assist with separation from other in-storm aircraft.</p>
<p>Hurricane Research - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) mode for sea surface roughness studies (scatterometry)</p>
<p>Ice Patrol (potential US Coast Guard mission support) - Inverse SAR (ISAR) mode to detect, identify and classify iceberg targets</p>
<p>Marine Sanctuary and other Maritime Patrol - SAR, ISAR and integrated Automatic Identification System (AIS) to detect, identify and classify maritime targets in support of NOAA's Marine Sanctuary stewardship</p>
<p>Other Potential Missions - Oil spill detection, Oceanic garbage patch gyre mapping, Marine Mammal detection</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Installation</span></p>
<p>The intent is for the antenna subsystem to be mounted in the existing Lower Fuselage Radome, allowing 360 deg rotation and horizontal field of view. The radome, identical in shape to the US Navy's EP-3 radome, is an oblate spheroid with maximum interior dimensions of approx. 44" (1.12 m) high and 148" (3.76 m) in diameter. There is a horizontal plate at the top-center for mounting the antenna pedestal. The radome can be split into left and right halves for system installation. There is room above the mounting plate (but still in the unpressurized area below the fuselage) for an IMU/INS and/or RF duplexer as desired. There is room for 1-3 ATR-sized units in a cabin rack above the L/F radome area. Specifics of weight, space and power limits, along with data interfaces will be provided if a solicitation is issued for this system.</p>
<p>NOAA is interested in vendors that can provide a commercial off-the-shelf system with the capabilities needed to perform the missions listed above. Although there may be some software customization and a custom physical installation in NOAA's unique aircraft, the basic hardware (Line Replaceable Units), processing software, and user interface should be a proven solution with commercial (FAA) and/or military (US DOD) certification/qualification. Potential vendors should provide information about systems they may offer, including name/model number, publicly available technical specifications, and information about certification/qualification and/or examples of existing aircraft installations.</p>
<p>This is a request for information (RFI) only and is not a request for quote nor an invitation for bid, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a formal solicitation or ultimately award a contract. The above NOAA requirements and information is provided to assist NOAA in conducting market research of industry to identify sources that can meet the NOAA requirements. Responses to this notice are voluntary and therefore the Government is not liable to pay or reimburse any contractors which respond to this notice. Any costs incurred by interested companies are solely the responsibility of the contractor. The Government does not intend to contract on the basis of this request or otherwise pay for any information solicited herein and the Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part any contractor's input resulting from this RFI.</p>
<p>It is the intent of this RFI to obtain company information and company capabilities for providing such equipment. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. All responses received within 30 days after date of publication of this request for information will be considered by the Government. Responses can be sent via email to ronald.f.anielak@noaa.gov or by fax to 757-664-3844.</p>
<p>The Government does not intend to host an information exchange meeting to discuss this RFI with interested potential respondents. Requests for clarification will be accepted with the 3-week window following initial release of this RFI. Responses to requests will be provided as an amendment to the RFI at the sole discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>All responsible business sources may submit a response which shall be considered by the agency. Interested firms shall include in addition to the information requested above, in writing: the company name, address, point of contact, telephone number, DUNS number and business size; a statement regarding their capabilities and qualifications to provide the required item; sufficient information that describes or demonstrates the firm's technical capability to provide the specified item; time of delivery to include design and manufacture of the item that meets NOAA requirements in months or weeks after receipt of a contract; sufficient information that describes or demonstrates the firm's technical capability to provide the specified required item; and if the item cannot be manufactured as defined by NOAA provide rationale.

<p style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; MARGIN-LEFT: 31.5pt; mso-list: l5 level1 lfo6"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol"><span>&bull;&middot;<span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Data Integration stage</span> moves and transforms data from the ODS to a Reporting &amp; Analytics Data Store, optimized for data retrieval, using fact &amp; dimension storage;</p>
<p style="TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; MARGIN-LEFT: 31.5pt; mso-list: l5 level1 lfo6"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Symbol; mso-fareast-font-family: Symbol; mso-bidi-font-family: Symbol"><span>&bull;&middot;<span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Business Intelligence stage</span> allows users to visualize the data in the form of reports, tables, and dashboards.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>DMRS uses Ab Initio to integrate and manage data from various systems and provide that data to components of the SCES solution architecture.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The first and second stage of the DMRS architecture is constructed using the configurable components of Ab Initio that provide the building blocks for data integration and management, quality, extract transform and load (ETL), migration/conversion, sharing, and applying appropriate business rules. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For the third stage of the DMRS architecture, SCES uses Qlik's QlikView and Microsoft's SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) for dashboard and reporting capabilities, respectively.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>QlikView business discovery platform delivers self-service BI and allows users to consolidate relevant data from multiple sources into a single view, explore the associations of data, and enables the visualization of data.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>SSRS provides the ability to create, deploy and manage canned reports for the SCES user community.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These canned reports may be in a variety of formats, but SSRS allows SCES to provide the user community with published reports, schedule report processing or access reports on-demand that can be exported in a variety of formats including MS Excel.</p>
<p>The SCES DMRS is collocated with the SCES ERP in a secure commercial accessible via the NIPRNet.</p>

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT: This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE. The U.S. Geological Survey is conducting a MARKET SURVEY to determine the interest and capability of any firm eligible to compete under NAICS code 541360 with a Small Business Size Standard $15.0M for an upcoming requirement for Airborne Magnetic and Electromagnetic Survey in Fort Irwin National Training Center, California.  A magnetic and electromagnetic system is required that can image lithologic variations and structural controls (faults and folds) on groundwater within a series of basins.

Overview:

The Veterans Health Administration (VHA), a component of the Department of Veterans' Affairs, would like to invite you to participate in "market research" that VHA is conducting.  The purpose of this unclassified request for information (RFI) is to enable the National Veterans Golden Age Games (NVGAG) representatives to obtain information from vendors who can provide storage space.  The warehouse storage space will be needed starting December 1, 2014 thru November 30, 2015.

The National Veterans Golden Age Games serves as a national showcase for the preventative and therapeutic value of sports, fitness and recreation. The Games serve as a qualifying event for competition in the National Senior Games in a number of competitive events. 

The NVGAG will use this information to gain a better understanding of industry's ability to support the event's storage needs.  This information will be fundamental to shaping the Department's future facilitation efforts.  We encourage your company to participate.

Admissions will be accomplished Monday -Thursday between 8am-4pm. Friday admissions will be coordinated with the contract liaison.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command - New Jersey (ACC-NJ), Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000, on behalf of the Department of Defense (DoD) Information Analysis Center's (IAC) Program Management Office (PMO), intends to enter into a Section 845 Prototype Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) with the National Security Technology Accelerator (NSTXL) Consortium for a period of three (3) years, for the purpose of executing a coordinated research and development program designed to re-use energy-related prototype technologies and scientific and technical information (STI) that are directly relevant to weapons or weapons systems.  <br>  <br> Only one such Consortium, the NSTXL, encompasses the expertise, knowledge, technologies, and innovation to meet the program objectives and goals of the coordinated research and development program designed to re-use energy-related prototype technologies and scientific and technical information (STI) that are directly relevant to weapons or weapons systems, and foster Technology Domain Awareness (TDA). The NSTXL has extensive knowledge of, and experience working with, innovative energy-related technologies, having acted as a facilitator or enabler to prospect, vet and transition commercial, R&D laboratory and academia-based technologies and match them to specific DoD and national security community technical requirements.  The NSTXL currently encompasses a large, diverse membership base which consists of industry, utility, investment, non-governmental organization (NGO), and academic members to work as counterpart to the participating DoD military installations and operational commands worldwide.  Members will function as connectors between DoD energy challenges and the broad technology marketplace in order to maximize opportunities for technology re-use.   <br>  <br> Under this Agreement, once a Government requirement is identified, the Government will issue a Request for White Papers (RWP) and orders will be competed only amongst NSTXL members. The NSTXL is an open consortium with a low barrier for membership. Any interested company, academic institution, or contractor can become a member and join the consortium, extending the breadth of knowledge and technical expertise available to the Government through its OTA for Re-Use of Energy-Related Scientific and Technology Information (STI) for DoD Prototypes to support the DoD Information Analysis Centers (IACs).  For more information, interested Parties can visit the NSTXL website at http://nstxl.org/.  <br>  <br> Please note that this Special Notice is for information purposes only and does not constitute a request for proposal or call for white papers. The Point of Contact for this action is Mr. Peter W. Gerhard, Agreement Specialist, ACC-NJ-ET, 973-724-1469; peter.w.gerhard.civ@mail.mil

<DESC>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the procurement of products or services.  This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (now operating as the U.S. AbilityOne Commission) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) the Committee is required to complete an impact analysis related to the potential addition of the following product(s) to the PL:</p>
<p>NSN:		7530-00-NIB-1104<br />Name:		File Folder, Single Tab, 1/3 Cut, Letter, Position 1<br />Description:	A letter-sized 1/3 cut single tab file folder. Position 1. UOI is BX. BX = 100 folders.</p>
<p>NSN:		7530-00-NIB-1105<br />Name:		File Folder, Single Tab, 1/3 Cut, Letter, Position 2<br />Description:	A letter-sized 1/3 cut single tab file folder. Position 2. UOI is BX. BX = 100 folders.</p>
<p>NSN:		7530-00-NIB-1106<br />Name:		File Folder, Single Tab, 1/3 Cut, Letter, Position 3<br />Description:	A letter-sized 1/3 cut single tab file folder. Position 3. UOI is BX. BX = 100 folders.</p>
<p>NSN:		7530-00-NIB-1107<br />Name:		File Folder, Single Tab, 1/3 Cut, Legal, Position 1<br />Description:	A legal-sized 1/3 cut single tab file folder. Position 1. UOI is BX. BX = 100 folders.</p>
<p>NSN:		7530-00-NIB-1108<br />Name:		File Folder, Single Tab, 1/3 Cut, Legal, Position 2<br />Description:	A legal-sized 1/3 cut single tab file folder. Position 2. UOI is BX. BX = 100 folders.</p>
<p>NSN:		7530-00-NIB-1109<br />Name:		File Folder, Single Tab, 1/3 Cut, Legal, Position 3<br />Description:	A legal-sized 1/3 cut single tab file folder. Position 3. UOI is BX. BX = 100 folders.</p>
<p>Should these items be added to the PL, the contracting agency who will be authorized by the Committee to order the products on behalf of the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne Program&reg; will be the General Services Administration, New York, NY.<br /> <br />Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a), would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected firms are dependent on the income.   Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies.  The products that have been thus far determined to likely be essentially the same are:</p>
<p>NSN:			7530-00-NIB-1104<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	SMD 10335; SMD 10331; Pendaflex 752131; UNV 12121; BSN16490</p>
<p>NSN:			7530-00-NIB-1105<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	SMD 10336; SMD 10332; Pendaflex 752132; UNV 12122; BSN16491</p>
<p>NSN:			7530-00-NIB-1106<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	SMD 10337; SMD 10333; Pendaflex 752133; UNV 12123; BSN16492</p>
<p>NSN:			7530-00-NIB-1107<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	SMD 15335; SMD 15331; UNV 15121</p>
<p>NSN:			7530-00-NIB-1108<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	SMD 15336; SMD 15332; UNV 15122</p>
<p>NSN:			7530-00-NIB-1109<br />ETS Stock Numbers:	SMD 15337; SMD 15333; UNV 15123</p>
<p>The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Total (A-List) Government Requirement.  That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne&reg; Program.</p>
<p>These products will also be offered through the AbilityOne Distributor Program.  If your firm is currently selling these products to the Federal Government through commercial means, your firm will continue to sell these products through your AbilityOne Distributor status and there would be no impact against your firm.  If your firm is not an AbilityOne Distributor but would like to become a Distributor, please contact the AbilityOne Program for guidance.  At a minimum, your firm must have a GSA Schedule 75 contract with at least 10,000 items on the schedule contract to be eligible.  Firms can become AbilityOne Distributors for limited items such as toner cartridges or janitorial/sanitation items but must contact the AbilityOne Program for more details.</p>
<p>If your firm is selling either the item(s) listed above, or the items that have been determined to be ETS, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period.  If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>
<p>6.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>7.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response.  Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than November 24, 2014 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov.  If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this Notice or the addition of the above-referenced product to the PL, please contact Mike Jurkowski at (703) 603-2117.</p>

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE PURCHASE ORDER:  The United States Department of Education (Department), Office of Communications and Outreach (OCO), intends to award a sole source purchase order for speech writing and other writing support.  The contractor shall assist in writing speeches, op-eds and articles on specialized topics, e.g., academics and athletics, high-performing inner city schools, and education reform.
<p><br />In accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b), soliciting from a single source, OCO intends to make a noncompetitive award to David Whitman.  Mr. Whitman has previous experience serving as Secretary Duncan's principal speechwriter for over 5 years.  He knows the Secretary's voice, cadence, and vocabulary.  In addition, Mr. Whitman is uniquely qualified to do work around academics and athletics.  For example, he assisted in drafting all of the Secretary's speeches and op-eds on the subject and has staffed the Secretary on all matters related to college athletics.</p>
<p><br />Mr. Whitman is a national expert in other content topics of the speeches and writings he will help produce: specifically, high performing inner city schools and education reform.  His book about inner city schools, Sweating the Small Stuff (written before coming to the Department), received national acclaim, and his perspective is in line with Department policy.  Beyond that, he is an accomplished journalist, having covered social policy from 1985-2003 for U.S. News &amp; World Report.  He also has written articles for the NY Times, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, the Atlantic, and New Republic.</p>
<p><br />Making a noncompetitive award to Mr. Whitman will maintain the integrity of the Department's message resulting in final products that will be consistent with that message, which is the intention of the procurement.   Working with Mr. Whitman will be cost effective, helping the Department avoid overhead costs and "start-up costs" associated with bringing another entity up to speed on the Department's programs, policies and priorities or the Secretary's personal style and voice.</p>
<p><br />The anticipated total value of the award is far below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold.  The contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one sole source under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation FAR 13, soliciting from a single source, only one source reasonably available. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.   Any responses to this notice of contract action shall be submitted to Contracting Officer no later than 12:00 P.M. E.S.T.  on November 13, 2014. Responses shall include a brief description of previously performed contracts providing speech writing services and experience with national education issues, to include customer/end-use points of contact.</p>

<DESC>This is a NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only acknowledgment and a written solicitation will not be issued. This contract is being procured a sole source basis due to the fact that Olympus is the only source available to provide the software maintenance and training on the Endoworks software. Olympus is the manufacturer of this specialized medical software and equipment and it contains proprietary hardware and software. Software Support and training is required for the Olympus Endoworks Software which the facility already owns.  No other known company offers software support and training for Endoworks.  This is being procured on an unusual and compelling basis as a result of this being the only company available to provide the software maintenance and training on the Endoworks software. 
The contract duration is for twelve (12) months for the base year to include four (4) option years.  This requirement is unrestricted-insufficient small business for commercial items under the North Atlantic Industrial Classification System (NAICS) 339112.

It is postulated that there is a useful trade space in terms of launch platforms; recovery platforms; recovery techniques; the number of UAS employed; the size (and cost) of the UAS; UAS speed, range, and endurance; UAS propulsion; UAS survivability; payload types; and operational concepts.<br /><br />This RFI seeks information on concept feasibility, unique and enabling platform technologies, system architectures, concepts of operation, modeling and simulation, potential demonstration platforms and approaches, and reusable low-cost delivery vehicle (UAS) platform concepts. DARPA is primarily interested in platform-related technologies and concepts. This RFI also seeks rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost and schedule information to assist in planning a potential future DARPA program in this area.<br /></div>

<DESC>The Deschutes National Forest is seeking testing of seed for R6 Bend Seed Extractory. Seed purity, viability &amp; moisture content examinations conducted for R6 Seed Extractory must be completed by AOSA (Association of Seed Analysts) certified analyst or SCST (Society of Commercial Seed Technologists) register analyst in an accredited laboratory. Examinations are completed at the time of initial seed processing and then re-tested every 3-5 years, depending on the species; as required by the WCF Seed bank regulations (FSM 2474.23) and per FSM 2470.03,3 (develop procedures &amp; arrangements with accredited seed testing laboratories to test seed for purity viability and moisture content and to supply standard laboratory reports of tests results. Currently the only site listed in both the AOSA and SCST Oregon State list is Oregon State University (ref.http://www.aosaseed.com/ or http:www.seedtechnology.net/). Historically, the OSU Seed laboratory has been conducting these exams; based on FSH 2409.26f SEED HANDBOOK; 42.1-6 which required OSU to be the examiner. The OSU Seed Laboratory have test exam results on file as far back as the initial exam for each seed lot; so these records are available to the R6 Bend Seed Extractory should something happen to our existing documents on-site. Because of the long-standing historical use of the OSU Seed Laboratory for these exams, OSU has extensive experience in performing tree seed germination exams and has equipment to do large volumes of seed lots in a short time span. They also perform both the no-chill and multiple-week pre-chill germination exams. In addition, since OSU is within the state of Oregon, it allows the R6 Seed Extractory personnel to visit and observe their services at any time. To keep records consistent with previous seed lots exams following the viability of the seed in long-term storage, the Seed handbook requirements of using OSU Seed Laboratory and the fact they are the only AOSA accredited seed laboratory in the state of Oregon, only OSU Stateme University can perform these tests. Therefore the Government intends to award a contract for this requirement to OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY, KERR ADMINISTRATION B306, CORVALLIS OREGON 977331 This is not a request for competitive quotes. However, all interested parties who believe they may meet these requirements may submit in writing, within 5 calendar days of this notification, complete information describing the ability to meet these requirements. Information will be used solely for purposes of whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Companies that can provide an equal product must submit their technical capabilities to include technical specifications of their product, past performance information, price and delivery time. All responses to this announcement must be directed to the Contracting Officer, Maria Gonzalez mgonzalez@fs.fed.us not later than&nbsp;4:30 pm Pacific Standard Time,&nbsp;NOVEMBER 17, 2014. TELEPHONIC QUESTIONS OR REQUESTS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.

<DESC>The National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Acquisition &amp; Grants Office, Western Acquisition Division-Boulder, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) along with Statutory Exception 41 USC 253 (C) (1) only one responsible source, with the Regional Transportation (RTD) in Denver, CO for regional transportation and Ecopass permits for the Denver and Boulder areas.
<p>The sole source determination is based on the NOAA's, National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) requirement with the RTD for Ecopass permits. The Ecopass permits allow employees of the Department of Commerce Boulder Labs to utilize the services of the RTD at no cost to the employee. The sole source determination is based on the fact that RTD is the only source of bus transportation and permits covering the Denver and Boulder area. The period of performance is 1/1/2015 through 12/31/2015.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe they can fully meet the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>

<DESC>NOAA's Acquisition &amp; Grants Office, Western Acquisition Division, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with WebsEdge Ltd. of London, United Kingdom, to produce and broadcast a video for the National Council for Science and Environment (NCSE) National Conference in Washington D.C.
<p>The sole source determination is based on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) requirement for a video to communicate in a public-friendly manner the climate science, data, and information products that the agency provides to the public, policy leaders, and stakeholder communities. Specifically, the video will focus on the way in which NOAA's science, data and information products are used to help scientists and the public understand the causes and effects of extreme events caused by weather, climate, and environment. The video is to be produced for the 15th National Conference and Global Forum on Science, Policy and the Environment to be held January 27-29, 2015.&nbsp; No other vendor can meet the NOAA requirement for the video because NCSE has granted WebsEdge Ltd sole and exclusive rights to product and broadcast conference video for the Science and the Environment TV channel for the 15th NCSE National Conference.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe they can fully meet the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact within 15 days after publication of this synopsis.

<SUBJECT>Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source Contract

<CONTACT>Mark Caban, Phone 303-497-6875, Fax 303-497-3163, Email mark.caban@noaa.gov
<DESC>This publication is to notify the public of the Government's intent to award a sole source contract to Humboldt State University for continued scientific observatory services at Trinidad Head Observatory (THD) for the Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Office of Atmospheric Research, Global Monitoring Division (GMD).  The contract will provide for a 1-year base period and four 1-year option periods.  This proposed sole source is in accordance with the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1), One Responsible Source.<br />
<p>THD is located in Trinidad Head, CA and this location and its facilities are used to sample air coming from the Pacific Ocean that may influence North American air quality. Government provided instrumentation is used by the vendor to measure aerosols, surface ozone, radiation, and flask sampling for halocarbons and carbon cycle gases at THD. Bi-weekly airborne vertical profile measurements provide a continuous baseline of pollution and climate forcing agents in the air entering the United States. This monitoring occurs in collaboration with GMD Marine Sciences Laboratory due to the need of comparing the same measurements at the same site for climate trending. Two critical elements are necessary in order to ensure project success and scientific accuracy:  (1) consistency of location and (2) consistency of data integrity and data linkage via continuity of service.</p>
<p>The Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition is attached to this Notice of Intent.   This Notice is not a request for competitive proposals. However, any firm taking objection to this sole source and that believes it can meet the THD requirement may provide written notification to the Contracting Officer which must be received within fourteen days after date of publication of this notice.  Any submissions to the Contracting Officer should clearly state the submitter's capability to satisfy the necessary observatory services.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>The NAICS code for this requirement is 541990, All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services and the small-business size standard is $15.0 million in average annual receipts.</p>
<p>Any questions regarding this solicitation must be submitted in writing via e-mail to the Contract Specialist, Mark Caban at mark.caban@noaa.gov.</p>

<a href="mailto:tom.barstow@navy.mil">Mr. Tom Barstow</a>
<DESC>Naval Facilities Engineering Command Atlantic is seeking input for a possible industry forum in 2015.  With current budget considerations, we are unable to host an on-site, conference-type industry forum in 2015, but we are considering returning to an on-line webinar industry forum, similar to the format we used in 2012.  NAVFAC workload data for construction, environmental, planning, design, and IDIQ contracts is being updated now on the NAVFAC public website and will be current for FY15 prior to 31 December 2014.

Our point-of-contact is Mr. Thomas E. Barstow, Deputy Operations Officer, tom.barstow@navy.mil.  Please respond to Mr. Barstow with answers to the following questions:
- Is a webinar industry forum of value to you?  
- Would you participate, or not, in a webinar industry forum?
- If interested in a webinar industry forum, what is the desired length of the webinar and what topics should be included?
- In which quarter of our fiscal year (1 October - 30 September) would you prefer an industry forum?

We would appreciate receiving comments on or before December 6, 2014.

<DESC>*The purpose of this amendment is to change the Solicitation posting date.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Assessment and Standards Division (ASD), National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL), Ann Arbor, Michigan, requires an on-vehicle activity measurement product, hereafter referred to as an on-vehicle activity measurement system and/or Portable Activity Measurement System (PAMS) with an option for additional units within a year. The acquisition of this Commercial item will be subject to small business set a-side and will be processed in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334519 Other Measuring and Controlling Device Manufacturing with a size standard of 500 employees.
EPA seeks to engage in widespread vehicle activity measurement to better understand how, where, and when vehicles are operated.  EPA desires to measure vehicle activity to understand the vehicle technologies being built and its daily operations.  EPA needs real-world activity data to create realistic inventories of mobile source emissions.  This data includes creating modeling databases, increasing our understanding of the activity of on-highway and nonroad vehicles and assessing the effectiveness of new and existing regulations.
Vehicle parameters that need to be collected, depending on the research test program, are as follows:  vehicle engine on/off, date and time of vehicle activity, vehicle speed, vehicle direction (longitude, latitude, and altitude), engine rpm, vehicle distance traveled, accelerations, vehicle loads, decelerations, time and date stamps when the PAMS is connected and disconnected from vehicle, engine control module (ECM) signals, fuel economy, humidity, barometric pressure, and ambient temperature.  
EPA's minimum performance goal is that each of these parameters being measured shall be quantified at 1 Hz and EPA's minimum accuracy goal is +/-10% with 95% confidence on all measurements.  These performance and accuracy goals will be compared to simultaneous certified laboratory results over the full range of steady-state and transient engine/vehicle operation.  These performance goals shall also be met for real world on-vehicle operations.  The specifications, which will be included in the solicitation, describes and sets forth the requested solution configurations for the Portable Activity Measuring System and other optional items.  		 Award will be made on a Best Value Basis.  All non-price evaluation criteria, when combined, are significantly more important than price.  Anticipated non-price evaluation criteria include demonstrated ability of the proposed system to meet or exceed the SOW requirements; past performance record under comparable contracts; and relevant previous experience.  The solicitation should be issued on or about November 13, 2014 on FedConnect.net.  
Point of Contact for this requirement is Gerold Young, Contract Specialist, at (513) 487-2660, or by email at young.gerold@epa.gov.  Questions must be submitted in writing to Gerold Young via email.  Telephone queries will not be honored.

<br />
<p class="Default">As a result of a series of recent laboratory safety and security incidents that were reported at U.S. government facilities in the Summer of 2014, the White House directed federal departments and agencies to review laboratory biosafety and biosecurity best practices and protocols, as well as complete a sweep of our facilities to ensure that Biological Select Agents and Toxins (BSAT) and other infectious or toxic materials are appropriately accounted for and stored.</p>
<p class="Default">EPA completed a sweep of all EPA laboratory facilities during September 2014.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>No unregistered BSAT materials were found during this event.</p>
<p class="Default">EPA is now encouraging all state, public, university or private laboratories, with which we partner, to participate in similar enhanced laboratory safety activities. Promoting safe and secure practices in laboratory facilities protects workers and the public, and prevents potential damage to plant and animal health.

<DESC>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA)/Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) intends to negotiate a sole source contract with APRIVA ISS, LLC ("APRIVA") for Engineering and Operational Support Services for the Secure Mobile Device Gateways (SMDG). A sole source Justification and Approval document is being coordinated and, upon approval, a copy of it will be posted here on FedBizOpps to comply with the public display requirements of FAR 6.305.<br />The proposed contract action is to provide the engineering and operations support for the SMDG, providing network and architecture designs, operational engineering support, test and evaluation support, configuration management support, engineering implementation support, technical/analytical performance analysis, technical/engineering documentation, and Department of Defense (DoD) wide engineering coordination for the SMDG. The purpose of this action is ensure continuous services are provided to operate and maintain current mobile gateways supporting classified requirements at two Contiguous United States (CONUS) locations and potentially up to two locations outside Contiguous United States (OCONUS) and two CONUS locations. The contractor will be required to provide services to engineer, acquire, and integrate the SMDG equipment at these OCONUS and CONUS locations when directed. The delivery of future OCONUS and additional CONUS nodes must have a transition plan to maintain current capability while expanding or upgrading globally.
<p>The resultant firm-fixed price contract will be for a 1-year base period and two 6-month option periods for a total of 2 years (24 months). The Government requires classified mobility gateway support to Develop a Suite B, Secure Communications Interoperability Protocol 231 Secure Voice over Internet Protocol (S-VoIP) solution containing a Windows Mobile 6.5 based S-VoIP solution with high quality of service and low latency. Vendor solution must provide a Virtual Private Network (VPN) on the Commercial Solutions for Classified (CSfC) approved list that supports both Rivest, Shamir, and Adelman (RSA) and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) certification. Solution must be compliant with National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) and CSfC. Contractor must also deliver the ability to reconfigure settings of SMDG devices and support infrastructures, provide solution to execute a smooth transition from legacy devices to DoD Mobile Classified Capability (DMCC) devices, support up to 2,000 DMCC devices, and provide 365 day, 24x7, Tier II and Tier III Help Desk Support to end user administrative personnel. This support includes onsite Defense Enterprise Computing Center personnel for the care and maintenance of legacy equipment which meets the critical operational needs DISA provides the DoD. Services must also be provided to engineer, acquire, integrate, and install the SMDG equipment at additional OCONUS and CONUS locations if needed and ensure DMCC system architectures and services are sustained without interruption.</p>
<p>At this time, APRIVA is the only source capable of providing the proprietary VPN design that supports the SMDG and is currently approved by the National Security Agency for classified system use. Additionally, APRIVA will not allow other contractors to use APRIVA's proprietary design and intellectual property through a teaming or other agreement. APRIVA is, therefore, the only feasible source that can support the continued mission needs at current levels without unacceptable delays and significant duplication of costs.</p>
<p>The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304 (c) (1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Companies that can provide this service must indicate their interest in writing within 3 business days of this advertisement. All responsible sources will be considered in evaluating the determination to issue a sole-source contract. Quotations or proposals received in response to this notice cannot be accepted since this synopsis cannot be considered a request for quote or a request for proposal.</p>

Pricing Information. <br />(1) Schedule B Submission<br />a. Submit completed copy of the Government-provided Schedule B containing the Offeror's proposed amounts. Enter pricing only on the Government Schedule B. Offeror shall NOT alter the Schedule B in any way with the exception of entering pricing. If the Schedule B is found to be altered in any way other than entering pricing, the action will be considered unacceptable and consequently, a reason to reject an Offeror's proposal. Schedule B unit prices shall be limited to two decimal places. <br />b. Identify a CLIN/SLIN (Contract Line Item/Sub Line Item) as Not Separately Priced by entering "NSP" in the unit price. Identify a CLIN/SLIN as No Charge by entering "NC" in the unit price.<br />c.

Therefore, the offeror/awardee may not propose for any taxes from which the Federal Government is exempt. In reference to CLIN 0004 - "Taxes, Fees and Surcharges" (TFS), Offeror(s) must submit the supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC rulings and rates, or other documentation justifying all applicable and allowable TFS. Enter only the amount that is documented as applicable and allowable. Inclusion of any amount that is not documented may render the proposal being rejected. Provide a separate delineation or breakdown of all applicable TFS.<br />(3) Provide a statement specifying that "all pricing in the proposal is Firm-Fixed, with the exception of TFS".</p>
<p>(c) Period of Acceptance of Offers. The Offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 120 days from the date specified for receipt of offers.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. If more than one solution to the services is available, Offeror may submit multiple offers for consideration, subject to same page limitations. Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided. Failure to include exceptions will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. The basis for award will be use of best value in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award a CSA for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:</p>
<p><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p><br />Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services. <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>
<p>(x) Complete all representations and certifications electronically at the following website: https://sam.gov/. If not completed on-line, Offerors must include a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3, which can be obtained at http://farsite.hill.af.mil, FAR Part 52 or online at https://sam.gov/. In addition, complete the following Addendum I to 52.212-3:<br /><br />52.212-3 Addendum, Certification to Accept the Government Purchase Card (GPC). If the Government's intent for payment is via the GPC IAW clauses 52.232-36 and 52.212-4, Addendum, paragraph (i) (3), the Offeror must certify that it:<br />( ) (i) will accept the GPC for payments under this contract.<br />( ) (ii) will not accept the GPC for payments under this contract.</p>

If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change.

The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. Subject to the provisions contained herein, the Government intends to award a single contract resulting from the Solicitation, to the Offeror who is deemed responsible in accordance with the FAR, as supplemented, whose Proposal conforms to the Solicitation's requirements (to included all stated terms, conditions, and all other information required by the Solicitation), and provides the lowest priced, technically acceptable proposal to satisfy the requirements of this Solicitation and the PWS. <br>  <br>    a. Evaluation criteria consist of two (2) evaluation factors. The Proposals will be evaluated under the following evaluation factors:  <br>  <br> 	Factor 1: Technical Capability  <br> 	 <br> 	Factor 2: Price <br>  <br>    b. Evaluation Factors. The Government's technical evaluation team will evaluate proposals to determine either technically acceptable or technically unacceptable (price excluded).   In order to be considered technically acceptable, the proposal for Factor 1 must be determined acceptable and must demonstrate an understanding of the requirements for all task areas described in the PWS. The proposal must demonstrate a practical/functional technical approach that meets the needs of the Solicitation. Failure to meet the criteria will render the proposal to be technically unacceptable and will not be considered for award. <br>  <br>       1) Factor 1: Technical Capability - To be deemed technically acceptable, the Offeror's Mission Capability must demonstrate: <br>  <br> a) An understanding of all tasks specified in this solicitation and describes how the requirement will be satisfied through clear methodologies, techniques, and detailed technical approach to meet the required objectives in the performance of technical requirements identified in PWS.  In evaluating, the assessment will concentrate on the offeror's plans for accomplishing the PWS requirements, to include proposed processes, schedule, and approaches.  Each proposal shall be evaluated on its ability to demonstrate a clear understanding of the contractual requirements and a corresponding plan to fulfill those performance requirements in the most effective and efficient manner possible for each functional task area.   <br>   <br> b) Organizational Structure.  The organizational line and block chart shall demonstrate a feasible structure to successfully manage the PWS requirements. An effective organizational structure that demonstrates whether the Offeror has all the necessary personnel qualifications, processes and plans in effect to ensure contract performance in accordance with the requirements of the PWS.  Personnel qualifications and minimum requirements for job standards must adequately support the requirements of the PWS.   The proposal must clearly demonstrate that all requirements of the PWS are met through identifying what parts of the organization are responsible for managing and accomplishing what work and clearly and rationally identify how the Offeror will successfully manage multiple tasks.  <br>  <br>       2) Factor 2: Price. The Offeror's price submission of all CLINs and Options will be evaluated considering the response to the solicitation.  The techniques and procedures described under FAR Part 15.404 will be the primary means of assessing price reasonableness. <br>  <br>    2. Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  As part of price evaluation, the government will evaluate its option to extend services (see FAR Clause 52.217-8) by adding one-half of the Offeror's final option period price to the Offeror's total price.  Thus, the Offeror's total price for the purpose of evaluation will include the Base Period, 1st Option Period, 2nd Option Period, 3rd Option Period, 4th Option Period, and 1/2 of the 4th Option Period. Offerors are not required to enter a price for the six-month period.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).   <br>  <br>    3. A written notice of award or acceptance of a quote, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept a quote (or part of a quote), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <br>  <br> (End of provision) <br>  <br> As part of price evaluation, the Government will evaluate its option to extend services (see FAR Clause 52.217-8) by adding six (6) months of the offeror's final option period price to the offeror's total price.  Offerors are required only to price the base and option periods.  Offerors shall not submit a price for the potential six month extension of services period.  The Government may choose to exercise the Extension of Services at the end of any performance period (base or option periods), utilizing the rates of that performance period. <br>  <br> (x) Provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications Commercial Items, An offeror shall complete only paragraphs (b) of this provision if the offeror has completed the annual representations and certificates electronically via http://www.acquisition.gov .

  (1)  The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the SAM database; 
  (2)  The Contractor?s CAGE code is in the SAM database; and 
  (3)  The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record ?Active?. The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process. <BR> <BR>?System for Award Management (SAM)? means the primary Government repository for prospective federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance related processes.

(b)(1)  The Contractor shall be registered in the SAM database prior to submitting an invoice and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.
  (2)  The SAM registration shall be for the same name and address identified on the contract, with its associated CAGE code and DUNS or DUNS+4.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.
(g)(1)(i)  If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name with a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to?

   (2)  The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database.  Information provided to the Contractor?s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. 
(h)  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.

<DESC>PURPOSE. To implement an emergency aerial mulch treatment with Certified Weed Free Rice Straw to restore soil cover in critical High and Moderate Soil Burn Severity areas of the King Fire and reduce increase in flood flows, and sediment delivery on the Eldorado National Forest, Georgetown Ranger District and Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD) lands permitted by the Forest Service. Applications will be done aerially to slopes 15 to 60%. Mulching will reduce downstream peak flows by absorbing and slowly releasing overland runoff which is likely to be increased due to reduced soil cover and hydrophobic soil conditions. Mulching will also help to protect the native seedbed and retain moisture on the burned slopes to facilitate quick vegetative recovery of the treatment areas.

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

<p>(2)(i) If the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract and the lack of performance will adversely affect national security, the total amount of the monies collected that should be returned to the Contractor; or</p>
<p>(ii) If the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract but will not impact national security, a recommendation that the Contractor promptly notify the IRS to attempt to resolve the tax situation.</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database;</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>

<p>"Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code" means-</p>
<p>(1) A code assigned by the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) to identify a commercial or Government entity; or</p>
<p>(2) A code assigned by a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that DLIS records and maintains in the CAGE master file. This type of code is known as an "NCAGE code."</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code into the SAM database; and</p>
<p>(2) The contractor has completed the Core Data, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>

<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.

(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business days written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of Payment paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.

(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims).
 Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractors SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of payment paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.

(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.

(u) Unauthorized Obligations. 

(1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the 
Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C.
 1341), the following shall govern:

(i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government.

(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ``I agree click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ``click-wrap or ``browse-wrap agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any 
Government authorized end user to such clause.

(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.

(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a Brand Name requirement for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, and as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation Number RFQ0002-15 is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ) and should be referenced on all correspondence. The RFQ document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-74, effective on November 1, 2014. This solicitation is considered an unrestricted procurement.
<p>DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT: The EEOC, Acquisition Services Division is requesting quotes on a brand name specific basis for the purchase of Notify Technology Corp. software required to synchronize e-mail and personal information management (PIM) data between servers and wireless networks and devices and to centralize management and control of the Commission's wireless device platforms. In FY 2014 the EEOC migrated from the older BlackBerry&reg; devices that used the BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES) to receive e-mail, calendaring, and remote management of BlackBerry devices. The newer BlackBerry devices were no longer compatible with the BES therefore, another solution was needed. Not only has the Commission purchased new BlackBerry devices (RIM), the EEOC has also purchased Apple (IOS), Android, and MS-Windows devices as well. To continue meeting this need the Commission selected Notifylink and Notify MDM as an e-mail, calendaring, and management solution for the new devices. The Commission has placed the Notifylink and NotifyMDM applications on EEOC's Government furnished smart phones. However, we have discovered that there are some management limitations with BlackBerry devices. Currently, Notify is much more compatible with the BlackBerry devices than any other product. The Brand Name Justification for the above required services is attached.</p>
<p>SCHEDULE OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES. CLIN 0001: Subscription Fee for NotifyLink On-Demand for 449 Product Seats (Qty of 12 months) at $____ per Device; CLIN 0002: Annual Fee for NotifyMDM (Mobile Device Management) On-Demand for 449 Product Seats (Qty of 12 months) at $____ per Device; and, CLIN 0003: Annual Fee for NotifyMDM On-Demand for 20 Product Seats (Qty of 12 months) at $___ per Device. TOTAL PRICE TO GOVERNMENT:$___ (CLIN Nos. 0001 thru 0003). PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE. The period of performance will be from December 1, 2014 through November 30, 2015. The estimated award date is November 24, 2014. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: EEOC Headquarters, Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>SUBMISSION OF QUOTATION. The quoter shall submit their quotation in two volumes. The quoter shall include the following with their quote: Part I: The quoter shall provide a price and description of all CLINs (0001 thru 0003) with the total price. Part II: The name, title, telephone number, fax number and email address of the point of contact. Part III: The nine digit DUNS and Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code with their quote. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) requires all contractors who provide goods/services to the EEOC to be actively registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) located at www.sam.gov to receive contract award or payments. The Government intends to award a single firm fixed-price contract to the responsible quoter whose quotation conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other price related factors considered. Quotes must be firm-fixed priced and include all quantities listed above on an all or none basis. BASIS OF AWARD: Award will be made based on best value using the lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) evaluation approach. EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD. The evaluation of quotations shall be on GO or No-Go basis and will occur in two sequential stages: Technical evaluation determines whether quotations are technically acceptable or unacceptable, followed by a price evaluation. GO: To be technically acceptable, all of the technical requirements as specified in this solicitation are met by the quoter. The technical capability factors are as follows: (1) Authorized NotifyLink/MDM Reseller: the quoter must provide evidence that it is an authorized Notify software reseller. The quoter must provide a Corporate line card that clearly states this information. For verification, the quoter must provide a website where the information is available. The authorized reseller must be able to provide all of the technical requirements that are specified in the RFQ. (2) Time and Delivery: The quoter must provide a written statement with their quote indicating that the quoter can meet the delivery requirements and provide services for the entire period of performance. (3) Experience on Similar Contracts: The quoter must provide evidence that it has successfully performed a minimum of three (3) contracts for the same or similar services within the past two (2) years to include contract type, contract number, contract value, point of contact name and telephone number, and the type of service provided. NO-GO: An unacceptable quote contains one or more deficiencies. The quote fails to meet specified technical requirements of this RFQ and not all of the technical requirements are met by the quoter. If the quoter is other than the manufacturer, then documentation must be provided showing that the quoter is authorized to resell the NotifyLink and NotifyMDM product. Once the quotes have been determined technically acceptable, award will be based on lowest price. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which will be considered by the EEOC. Interested quoters must submit questions regarding this solicitation via email to the Contracting Officer, Doreen Starkes, Attn: Doreen.Starkes@eeoc.gov, not later than Monday, November 10, 2014, at 11:00 a.m. (Washington, DC local time). No telephone inquiries will be accepted. The closing date for receipt of responses (quotations) to this solicitation is Friday, November 14, 2014 at 11:00 a.m. (Washington, DC local time). Quoters may e-mail responses to the attention of the Contracting Officer, Doreen Starkes, at: Doreen.Starkes@eeoc.gov. The contracting office address is U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 131 M Street, N.E., 4th Floor, OCFO/ASD, Washington, D.C. 20507.

<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6 and part 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number HSCG38-15-Q-200022 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-74 effective 1 November 2014, which also incorporates the provisions and clauses of FAC 2005-77.</p>
<p>The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336411. The small business size standard is 1,500 employees. This is an unrestricted requirement. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price purchase order shall be awarded on a sole source basis to Airbus Helicopter Incorporated (AHI) as a result of this synopsis/solicitation. All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Airbus Helicopter France (Cage Code F0210). Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.</p>
<p>It is the Government's belief that AHI is the only known source to provide traceability, and genuine OEM parts, required to successfully provide these items. Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation. No alternate part numbers will be accepted.</p>
<p>SEE ATTACHED SPREADSHEET "HSCG38-15-Q-200022 - REQUIREMENTS" FOR A LIST OF REQUIRED PARTS.</p>
<p>Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of our aircrew. Best Value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight. Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or stand military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation. <br />Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 or equivalent European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) Certification, a Certificate of Conformance and traceability to the OEM. The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.</p>
<p>The contractor shall furnish a COC in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.246-15. COC must be submitted in the format specified in the clause. All replacement parts shall be NEW approved parts.</p>
<p>NO SUBSTITUTE OR ALTERNATE PARTS WILL BE CONSIDERED. ONLY NEW PARTS WILL BE ACCEPTED.</p>
<p>Consistent with FAR Provision 52.212-1(h), the Government reserves the right to make more than one award (multiple awards) for different line items, if, after considering the additional administrative cost to the Government of awarding and administering separate purchase orders, it is determined that the multiple awards will result in the best value to the Government. For purposes of evaluating the cost of making multiple awards, it is assumed that the administrative cost of awarding and administering a purchase order is $500.</p>
<p>NOTE: NO DRAWINGS, SPECIFICATIONS OR SCHEMATICS ARE AVAILABLE FROM THIS AGENCY.</p>
<p>SEE ATTACHED DOCUMENT TITLED "TERMS AND CONDITIONS - HSCG38-15-Q-200022" FOR APPLICABLE CLAUSES, INSTRUCTIONS AND EVALUTION CRITERIA.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

All quantities shown in the schedule are estimated. Therefore, there is no guarantee, stated or implied, as to the actual quantities that will be calibrated under this contract.
<p>The following clauses and provisions are included:</p>
<p>52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items Apr 2014</p>
<p>Period of Acceptance of Offers<br />(c) Prices must remain effective for 90 days after solicitation closes.</p>
<p>Notice of Pre-award Survey <br />(a) Offerors are advised that the Government may contact potential contractors to ascertain their capabilities to perform the work specified in this solicitation. In addition to financial statements and credit rating checks, the Government may visit a prospective contractor's facility(s). Areas of interest on this survey may include, but are not limited to the following:</p>
<p>(1) Performance plans <br />(2) Quality assurance and control plans <br />(3) Personnel recruitment and training plans<br />(4) Workload factor for manpower utilization <br />(5) Management plan for handling peak workloads <br />(6) Production capability.<br />(i) Plant facilities, equipment, and labor resources <br />(ii) Purchasing and subcontracting <br />(iii) Performance record and ability to meet delivery schedules</p>
<p>(b) Offerors are advised that accomplishment of this survey is a part of the evaluation process and is not to be construed as an indication that an offeror will receive or is in the best position to receive the resultant award. However, any offeror that fails to meet the requirements of the site survey will no longer be considered for award.</p>
<p>Service Contract Labor Standards<br />The Service Contract Labor Standards could apply to any contracts awarded through this solicitation. In accordance with (IAW) FAR 22.1009-4, the place of performance for this contract is unknown. The Contracting Officer has determined one possible place of performance and has included Wage Determinations for as an attachment to this solicitation. The Contracting Officer will obtain wage determinations for additional possible places of performance if asked to do so in writing at linda.j.stulick@uscg.mil.</p>
<p>Offerors must request additional wage determinations no later than (date and time will be two days before solicitation close). Offerors who intend to perform in a place or area of performance for which a wage determination has not been attached or requested may nevertheless submit proposals. However, a wage determination shall be incorporated in the resultant contract, and there shall be no adjustment in the contract price.</p>
<p>Delivery Requirements<br />F.O.B. Destination is requested as the F.O.B. point for all deliverables. All offers will be considered F.O.B. Destination unless F.O.B. origin is specified AND estimated shipping costs are included.</p>
<p>Evaluation Criteria<br />The provision at Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.212-2 Evaluation of Commercial Items is not applicable to this solicitation. In lieu of this provision, quotes will be evaluated based on the criteria listed below. Award will be made to the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer with acceptable or neutral past performance.</p>
<p>Price: The offeror shall provide pricing as requested in the attached spreadsheet titled "HSCG38-15-Q-800004 Quote Sheet". Any quantity price discounts and discounts for prompt payment should be included in this section. Total price evaluation will be for the base and all four option periods. Failure to quote pricing for the base year and all respective option years on individual line items may result in a quotation being excluded from further consideration.</p>
<p>If needed, the Government intends to exercise the option or options under FAR 52.217-8 without further competition or need for justification for other than full or open competition [or limited source justification or sole source justification]. For purposes of evaluation, the potential need to exercise the option under FAR 52.217-8 to extend the period of contract performance for the maximum period of six (6) months beyond the last option period will be considered the same for all offerors. In considering the price of the base period and any option periods, the Government will consider that if the extension of service clause (FAR 52.217-8) is exercised, it will be on the exact same rates and terms, other than length of performance, as the base or option period being extended. The Government will determine whether the price, inclusive of all options (including the options available under FAR 52.217-8), is fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>Technical Acceptability: Technical Acceptability will be evaluated to determine an overall rating of "acceptable" or "unacceptable". This will be determined by evaluating the ability of the offeror to provide a sound, compliant approach that meets all requirements listed in the Statement of Work (SOW) and demonstrates a thorough knowledge and understanding of the requirements. It is the contractor's responsibility to ensure that their quotation clearly demonstrates their ability to perform these requirements.</p>
<p>All offerors must provide the following minimum information and documentation with their quotations:<br />&bull; Ability of the offeror to meet the Delivery requirements listed in the SOW.<br />&bull; Detailed explanation of any requirement listed in the SOW that cannot be successfully accomplished by the offeror.</p>
<p>Past Performance: The Past Performance evaluation will assess the offeror's ability to successfully accomplish the proposed effort based on the offeror's demonstrated Past Performance.</p>
<p><br />Past Performance Relevance Definitions<br />Very Relevant Past Performance/Experience that involved essentially the same magnitude of effort and complexities that this solicitation requires. <br />Relevant Past Performance efforts that involved much of the magnitude of effort and complexities that this solicitation requires. <br />Somewhat Relevant Past Performance efforts that involved some of the same magnitude of effort and complexities that this solicitation requires. <br />Not Relevant Past Performance efforts did not involve any of the magnitude of effort and complexities this solicitation requires.</p>
<p>The Government may also use information available from past contracts/purchase orders with the USCG, delivery information found in the USCG's AMMIS system, and any information found using sources such as Federal Government sources, Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS)/Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS). The Government reserves the right to limit or expand the number of references it decides to contact and to contact references other than those provided by the offeror.</p>
<p>Evaluation Method:<br />Only the lowest priced offer will be evaluated for Technical Acceptability. Should the lowest priced offer not receive an acceptable technical or past performance rating, the process will continue in order of lowest priced offer until the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer with acceptable or neutral past performance is identified.</p>

May 2014<br />An offeror shall complete only paragraphs (b) of this provision if the offeror has completed the annual representations and certificates electronically via http://www.acquisition.gov .

<p>Ombudsman Notice</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

Enter pricing only on the Government Schedule B. Offeror shall NOT alter the Schedule B in any way with the exception of entering pricing.

Schedule B unit prices shall be limited to two decimal places. <br />b. Identify a CLIN/SLIN (Contract Line Item/Sub Line Item) as "Not Separately Priced" by entering "NSP" in the unit price.

<p>(c) Period of Acceptance of Offers. The Offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 120 days from the date specified for receipt of offers.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. If more than one solution to the services is available, Offeror may submit multiple offers for consideration, subject to same page limitations. Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided. Failure to include exceptions will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, applies to this solicitation along with the following addenda to the provision:<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. The basis for award will be use of best value in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award a CSA for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 -- TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence of being a telecommunications company and owning most of the facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services. <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>

<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

<p>10. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 13 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>OTI's Niger program seeks to further U.S. foreign policy objectives in Niger through support that targets drivers of instability in Niger and the region. Drivers may include, but are not limited to, political and economic exclusion, particularly among youth and marginalized groups, reintegration of returned workers and ex-combatants, the presence of extremist organizations, lack of state presence and/or good governance coupled with a lack of opportunities for political participation. OTI intends to address these critical issues through a flexible, small-grants mechanism that tailors approaches to the varied needs of communities in Niger. The program may utilize both "soft" (e.g. cultural and recreational activities, media and strategic communications) and "hard" (e.g. small-scale infrastructure) activities to strengthen linkages between communities, local actors, and the Nigerien government and to increase community cohesion. The program may also support national level activities, such as elections in 2016 or other emerging transition needs.</p>
<p>The Country Representative - Niger is a member of the Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI Africa Regional Team, and reports to the Washington-based OTI Regional Team Leader or his/her designee. The Country Representative's principle responsibility will be the development, oversight and management of DCHA/OTI's Niger program. The Country Representative will be called upon to represent OTI's mission and programs to senior-level government officials, in-country visitors, senior officials from other international organizations, bilateral donors and local government officials.</p>
<p>The Country Representative post is a senior-level position requiring supervisory management experience, the ability to serve as an effective liaison with a wide array of individuals and institutions, and an in-depth knowledge of international relations in general.  Knowledge of the sub-region is also desirable. Familiarity with a wide range of issues is necessary, including community development, mediation/arbitration, conflict resolution, democracy/governance and human rights. Excellent interpersonal, presentation and negotiation skills are necessary. Experience in contract and grant management is required. Prior work experience with U.S. Government agencies and/or managing program operations in civil conflicts is preferred. The successful candidate will possess excellent political analysis and reporting skills, and the ability to operate with a high degree of autonomy, responsibility and authority in a highly stressful environment while exercising sound judgment in politically-charged and challenging security environments. It is also essential that the incumbent demonstrate the ability to maintain staff morale in a difficult work environment. Strong team-building skills are essential.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the Country Representative requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. As a member of a highly operational office, the incumbent is willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success. The incumbent has a high level of integrity and attention to detail to ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation. The incumbent is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. She or he places a premium on the building of positive relationships with his or her respective team both in the field and in Washington, and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The incumbent is able to prioritize and complete tasks without follow-up by the supervisor, while also filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team. The Country Representative is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>
<p>Under the direct supervision of the Washington-based DCHA/OTI Regional Team Leader for Africa or his/her designee, the Country Representative will perform the following duties:</p>
<p>&bull;	Conceptualize and design program strategies and objectives in close coordination with OTI staff, USAID personnel, U.S. Embassy and local civil society officials, based on political analysis and U.S. Government policy. When necessary, refine strategic objectives and advocate on behalf of new programmatic approaches in country, linked to neighboring country programs where appropriate;</p>
<p>&bull;	As requested by embassies or USAID Missions, provide support for the design and execution of programs that follow OTI's quick-impact programming model. Support to embassies and USAID Missions may include attendance and/or facilitation of program management processes for follow-on programming including rolling assessments, strategy review sessions, program performance reviews, and management reviews;</p>
<p>&bull;	Communicate and coordinate in-country activities between OTI and its implementing partners, the U.S. Embassy, and other donor organizations;</p>
<p>&bull;	Design staffing plans to meet overall program objectives and recruit, train, supervise, mentor and evaluate the performance of in-country OTI staff, providing regular feedback;</p>
<p>&bull;	Monitor local and regional political developments and regularly brief OTI and partner staff on their potential programmatic impact;</p>
<p>&bull;	Manage and provide day-to-day programmatic, operational, and strategic guidance to OTI's implementing partners (contractors and/or grantees), ensuring that activities are contributing to OTI's program objectives and are within the partner's scope;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide recommendations to the Washington-based Contracting Officer Representative (COR) and/or the Regional Team Leader on the implementing partner's performance, budget, and appropriateness of scope in achieving OTI's country objectives, presenting modifications thereto;</p>
<p>&bull;	Provide USAID concurrence on all implementing partner activities, including final approval of grantees for grants under contract in accordance with USAID's Automated Directives System (ADS);</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure that OTI programs and activities are monitored and evaluated, and that lessons learned feed into ongoing or future activities.</p>
<p>&bull;	Analyze and report on current political developments, security concerns, and other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure appropriate resource allocation among OTI field offices and implementing partners;</p>
<p>&bull;	Prepare and maintain OTI program budgets for field operations;</p>
<p>&bull;	Serve as OTI's primary liaison with USAID personnel, U.S. Embassy staff, ambassadors, local government officials, UN organizations, indigenous and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and other pertinent agencies and organizations. Develop and maintain collaborative relationships to ensure close coordination at the field level, identify the widest range of potential partners and opportunities, and achieve maximum synergy with other programs;</p>
<p>&bull;	Prepare operational plans in collaboration with the U.S. Embassy, including logistics and property use guidelines, closeout and hand-over, security procedures, contingency and evacuation plans;</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation;</p>
<p>&bull;	Ensure that all OTI and partner field staff adhere to the in-country security guidelines set by the U.S. Embassy Regional Security Officer and other organizations such as the United Nations or host government;</p>
<p>&bull;	Prepare and disseminate programmatic, financial and quarterly reports to the U.S. Embassy, OTI/Washington and other organizations as appropriate;</p>
<p>&bull;	Supervise staff in conjunction with the Regional Team Leader (e.g. Deputy Country Representative, Program Managers, Program Assistants, Administrative Program Assistants, etc.). Provide orientation, training, and mentoring for staff supervised; assign work, explain how duties are to be performed to meet expectations, and communicate how the successful performance of those duties will be measured; evaluate staff performance; recognize good performance; communicate where performance needs to be improved; resolve complaints; and approve leave requests and timesheets as well as training, travel and program and operations requests;</p>
<p>&bull;	Perform other duties as determined by the supervisor to ensure successful OTI program implementation.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Country Representative - Niger will be supervised by the Washington-based DCHA/OTI Regional Team Leader for Africa or his/her designee as part of OTI's Field Programs Division, as well as the Niger Mission Director. The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision. Though this is a senior field-based position, the incumbent is expected to actively and proactively collaborate with OTI/Washington leadership, and to fully utilize, embrace, and become an expert on OTI systems and processes. Failure to adequately perform the scope of work above and/or failure to take direction from the supervisor may result in corrective actions, including denial of step or grade increases, extension of contract probationary periods, performance improvement plans, and/or termination for the convenience of USAID/OTI.</p>

The employee will independently plan, design and carry out programs, projects, studies or other work assignments. The employee's work will be considered technically authoritative and normally accepted without significant change, and will be reviewed in terms of fulfillment of program objectives, influence on the overall program, or contribution to the advancement of the objective.</p>

<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The Air Force Research Laboratory is soliciting white p963369pers for various scientific studies, analytical tools, algorithm developments, projects, and experiments focused on developing Multi-Source, Activity-Based Analysis capabilities to provide the Air Force the means to better conduct Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR).</p>
<p>BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>The Processing and Exploitation Core Technical Competencies (CTC) mission is to lead the discovery, development, and application of technology to enable the processing and exploitation of multi-source ISR data for commanders, decision makers, and intelligence analysts. The volume of sensor data produced is enormous and still growing rapidly; however the ability to process and exploit this data has not been able to keep pace with the sheer volume of data produced. The Multi-Source Analysis (MSA) sub-CTC, which is the intended target of this Funding Opportunity, focuses on the creation of force multipliers for the ISR operators/analysts by developing automated processes to identify, extract, analyze, correlate, and sort multi-source data in order to classify and identify activities, entities and entity-relation networks in the battlespace. It also supports analysts in developing/maintaining more comprehensive situational awareness on an area of responsibility, as well as expertise on a topic in which they specialize. Multi-source exploitation and analysis capabilities are needed to turn data into information for the analyst. The key aspect is to provide automated capabilities to help the analyst more efficiently develop target sets, answer time-sensitive requests for information and produce intelligence analysis reports.</p>
<p>The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate (AFRL/RI) has an established test-bed facility that provides evaluation, assessment and demonstration of intelligence tools. The Automated Processing and Exploitation (APEX) Center provides a facility for algorithm development and evaluation, analytical studies, on-site and network distributed simulation exercises and demonstration of fusion technologies with real and simulated multiple source intelligence (multi-INT) data. Capabilities include scenario generation, and platform and sensor modeling. Simulators have been developed for various intelligence data types such as Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) information, electronic signals intelligence (ELINT) and measurement and signature intelligence (MASINT). Highly developed multi-INT data fusion systems are available for application to the problem of ground target tracking against a variety of operational scenarios. Analytical tools that quantify established measures of performance (MOPs) are available for target tracking and other applications. In total the APEX Center helps to facilitate a broad range of intelligence capabilities, and fusion technology development.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE:</p>
<p>The Information Directorate, Activity Based Analysis Branch, is soliciting white papers under this announcement for unique and innovative technologies to explore and develop network-centric, collaborative intelligence analysis capabilities that allows the fusion of multi-INT and data sources to enable accurate, shared, real-time intelligence products that locate and characterize entities, and tracks events, activities, and adversary networks. The key aspect is to provide automation capabilities for the analyst in the development of target sets and intelligence analysis reports. The three focus areas within MSA include: (1) Integrated Tracking, Analysis and Discovery (ITAD), (2) Multi-Source Information Extraction &amp; Analysis, and (3) Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) Enterprise to the Edge (CETE). AFRL/RI intends to utilize the APEX Center capabilities to assist analytical studies, on-site and network distributed simulation exercises, and the processing of real-world, multi-INT data. The availability or use of Government Furnished Property/Government Furnished Equipment (GFP/GFE) will be determined on a contract-by-contract basis, but no GFP/GFE is anticipated at this time. Any GFP/GFE required by the offerors must be clearly identified in the submitted white paper.</p>
<p>Descriptions of Key Focus Areas:</p>
<p>1. ITAD intends to enable the analyst's ability to collect, characterize and locate activities and transactions. This includes identifying and locating actors conducting the activities and transactions, the networks of these actors, the relationships between networks, and the development of patterns of life (spatial and temporal motion statistics). ITAD seeks to develop automated processing and exploitation capabilities for activity based detection, normalcy and wide-area motion statistics. There are two major areas under ITAD: Motion Exploitation (ME) and Activity-Based Intelligence (ABI). ME includes automatic tracking and activity detection. ABI includes patterns of life, motion-augmented link and network discovery, and activity characterization. The specific technology areas of interest under these areas include but are not limited to:</p>
<p>Automatic Tracking is developing technology to perform continuous tracking of objects through the use of multi-intelligence feature and contextual data from similar and dissimilar domains. Performance must be optimized across sensor variations, target densities, real time/forensic operations, automatic/operator in the loop control, and operational scenarios.</p>
<p>Activity Detection is developing automated techniques and tools to discover activity within the motion data (events, sequences, changes) to provide clues to analysts and for automated analysis. This spans individual activities (e.g. check point avoidance) through aggregate Area of Interest (AOI) -wide motion activities (e.g. traffic volume or full retreat).</p>
<p>Wide Area Motion Statistics, characterizes and develops patterns of life in researching automated tools to exploit motion data including anomaly detection to characterize normalcy, finds origins and destinations, and relates statistical features to events.</p>
<p>The Motion-Augmented Link and Network Discovery area develops algorithms to define and exploit multi-source networks representing adversary organizational structure and behavior.</p>
<p>Activity Characterization is researching techniques to dynamically update the assessment of insurgent activity with the probable intent, phase of operation, location, timing and participants associated with observed or detected activities and events. This will characterize and assess detected activity by combining kinematic analysis with behavior analysis and social network analysis for enhanced and timely situational awareness (SA).</p>
<p>AFRL/RI is soliciting innovative research white papers of interest to the Activity Based Analysis Branch for the specific technology areas listed above. Advancements are required to optimize performance, algorithm development, researching techniques and develop automatic techniques and tools.</p>
<p>2. Multi-Source Information Extraction &amp; Analysis capabilities allow for the efficient and effective exploitation of information that is contained within large volumes of structured, unstructured and semi-structured textual data. These data sets are very challenging to exploit as they can include material from many different sources, languages, genres and domains of interest and can be so vast that the application of automated analysis and visualization tools is necessary to have a chance at achieving a comprehensive understanding of the content. Employing Multi-Source Information Extraction &amp; Analysis capabilities greatly reduces the time it takes analysts to exploit these ever increasing volumes of textual data to produce reliable decision-making information. Addressing this textual data overload is a foundational component of the Secretary of Defense's "Data to Decisions" science and technology priority. The major areas within Multi-Source Information Extraction &amp; Analysis include: (1) Entity, Event &amp; Relationship (EER) Extraction; (2) Association &amp; Resolution (A&amp;R); and (3) Analysis &amp; Visualization (A&amp;V). EER addresses the extraction of entities, events and relationships from open source text, messages, reports, social media and structured databases such as transactions, communications, social relationships, sightings, and organizational structures. A&amp;R deals with multi-source/document data association and resolution as well as consolidation and association of data across disparate information sources using techniques such as standardization, normalization and probabilistic reasoning techniques. A&amp;V is developing algorithms for analysis and visualization of entities, events and relationships as they change over time. Parallelizable batch and real time graph analytic algorithms and heuristics to derive and maintain graph measures, graph matching and graph bundling to identify semantic and structural equivalences, and graph mining to discover new patterns of interest. The specific technology areas of interest under these areas include but are not limited to:</p>
<p>EER Extraction: Data preparation (e.g. document zoning), smart filtering (e.g. document and corpus summarization), extraction of explicit and non-explicit entities, events, relationships and their attributes, within document entity and event co-reference, exploitation of idiosyncratic text types (e.g. micro text), sentiment analysis, domain customization and native foreign language exploitation.</p>
<p>A&amp;R: Cross source entity and event resolution, data source alignment, hard/soft fusion, and deception detection.</p>
<p>A&amp;V: Social network analysis, network analytics, pattern discovery, scalable algorithms, and novelty detection.</p>
<p>AFRL/RI is soliciting innovative research white papers of interest to the Activity Based Analysis Branch for the technology areas listed above, and their effective application to meet operator/analyst needs. Advancements are required to increase the speed, scalability and accuracy of textual analysis; to provide a greater depth of understanding of textual content, effectively map and link multiple concepts and relationships to increase comprehension and coordinate the derived knowledge across multiple intelligence media.</p>
<p>3. The C4ISR Enterprise to the Edge (CETE) program seeks innovative revolutionary solutions for processing closer to the sensors to minimize the latency of exploitation products associated with very high density and high throughput airborne sensors offsetting severe communication constraints by significant onboard computing capabilities. A strategic approach should take advantage of mission context and location specific exploitation, semi-automated and assistive methods to multiply analyst effectiveness and/or autonomous and dynamically steerable decision making algorithms. Fast and efficient summarization, indexing, storage, management, and delivery methods based on high performance computing are critical to this vision. Distributed computing models applicable to concurrent coordinated sensing, summarization of dynamic events, through multiple independently moving sensor platforms is critical to develop the next generation of persistent surveillance across large hostile areas. Evasive presence and opportunistic reach-back communication, and associated onboard processing are among the options. Future platforms will combine multiple independently moving passive and coordinated risk-managed active sensing including: video, hyperspectral, passive-radar, and quasi-passive multistatic synthetic aperture imaging, and must robustly address operations within a denied environment (Anti-Access/Area Denial (A2/AD)) through stand-off surveillance and autonomous operations, taking advantage of dynamic awareness derived from other sources (SIGINT). A combined advantage of sensor-persistence, on-board storage, on-board computing, and intelligent exploitation algorithms will offer a wide range of solutions to effectively meet the mission requirements. Major areas under CETE include Context-Based Exploitation Architecture Designs (CBEAD), Information Management (IM), adaptive methods of latency minimization, Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR), Mapping of Key Algorithms on versatile architecture (MoKA) to deliver "code-once and run anywhere" capabilities.</p>
<p>The CBEAD area will focus on context specific exploitation algorithms including intelligent ways of estimating resource requirements impacting onboard realization of such exploitation algorithms.</p>
<p>MoKA area will focus on developing approaches to map algorithms to on board processors of varied computational resources. The objective is to ensure that the algorithms can be effectively implemented on-board a platform within size, weight, and power (SWaP) restrictions. Furthermore, the developed solutions are required to meet the data storage requirements, and utilize computing methods to exploit both long-duration persistent data, and short-duration tactical data, while smartly adapting the computational effort to the required throughput.</p>
<p>The IM area is to ensure that the algorithms utilize big data solutions (e.g. Multidimensional Integrated Ontology (MDIO) and Managed Information Object (MIO)) that balance expressiveness with resource limitations. The IM effort will insure that the information produced by CETE can be effectively distributed across multisensory and multimodal assets, intelligently leverage database solutions and quickly disseminate products to a broad user community.</p>
<p>The CBIR area is focused on developing exploitation algorithms that can detect, track, and identify targets of interest, monitor regions of interest, measure patterns of life, etc. from standoff-sensors. The intent is for the algorithm to be agnostic to the platform and sensor specifics and to produce low-bandwidth products that can be efficiently disseminated in real time to a broad user community. Method designs should push processing closer to the sensor to eliminate communication latency constraints, improve salient content, and enable robust mission solutions.</p>
<p>AFRL/RI is soliciting innovative research white papers of interest to the Activity Based Analysis Branch for the specific technology areas listed above and will span various maturity levels. Advancements are required to increase the speed of image-based analysis, provide a greater depth of understanding of image-based content, effectively map and link multiple concepts and relationships to increase comprehension and coordinate the derived knowledge across multiple intelligence media.</p>
<p>Solutions proposed for the above three areas will undergo testing, evaluation, integration, and verification in the APEX Center. The facility may be used to perform analysis for all efforts proposed under this BAA. The overall mission is to understand, measure, and advance the state of technology in the fusion of information. Offerors should consider any potential advancements that may be required for the APEX Center to support this BAA's 3 focus areas. If specialized modeling and simulation, scenarios for testing, analytical tools, algorithm developments, or new evolving metrics and evaluation standards are required in order for the Government to perform tasks within the APEX Center, include that information within the white paper.</p>

APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:<br /><br />1. CRITERIA: Proposals will be evaluated through a peer or scientific review process using the following criteria, in which criteria (1) through (3) are of equal importance and criteria (4) is of lesser importance than criteria (1) through (3), to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit -- The approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology including technical feasibility, degree of innovation, understanding of the technical and operational approach for evaluation of the technology; (2) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge; (3) Openness/Maturity of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged, the ability to share and change software, and the appropriate technology relative maturity (e.g., accuracy, timeliness, confidence, throughput, reliability, and robustness); The potential for AFRL to transition the research and development deliverables to future Government needs. Any proposed restriction on technical data or computer software will be considered. (4) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any). No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.<br /><br />2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: (a) Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; (b) Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and (c) Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.<br /><br />3. The Government may simultaneously evaluate proposals received under this BAA from multiple offerors. In this case, the Government may make award based on adequate price competition, and offerors must be aware that there is a possibility of non-selection due to a proposal of similar but higher-priced technical approach as compared to another offeror.<br /><br />VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:<br /><br />1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.

<p>V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:<br /><br />1. CRITERIA: White papers and proposals will be evaluated through a peer or scientific review process using the following criteria, which are listed in descending order of importance, and will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: (1) The overall scientific and/or technical merits of the proposal, including the approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology; (2) The potential contributions of the effort to the U.S. Air Force Full Spectrum SIGINT, and Cyber Operations Technology mission; (3) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge, the offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques, or unique combination of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives; as well as the qualification, capabilities and experience of the proposed principal investigator, team leader, and other key personnel who are critical to achieving the proposal objectives and the offeror's record of past and present performance; (4) Openness/Maturity of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness; and (5) The reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees, if any. No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received. <br /><br />2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, and comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: (a) Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; (b) Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and (c) Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection. <br /><br />3. The Government may simultaneously evaluate proposals received under this BAA from multiple offerors. In this case, the Government may make award based on adequate price competition, and offerors must be aware that there is a possibility of non-selection due to a proposal of similar but higher-priced technical approach as compared to another offeror.</p>
<p>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION <br /><br />1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.<br />All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after white paper/proposal submission.<br /><br />2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS: Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a SECRET or TOP SECRET facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to SECRET or TOP SECRET information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. This acquisition may involve data that is subject to export control laws and regulations. Only contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) at <a href="http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/">http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/</a> and have a legitimate business purpose may participate in this solicitation.

You must submit a copy of your approved DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your Proposal.<br /><br />3. Data Rights: The potential for inclusion of Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or data rights other than unlimited on awards is recognized. In accordance with (IAW) the Small Business Administration (SBA) SBIR Policy Directive, Section 8(b), SBIR data rights clauses are non-negotiable and must not be the subject of negotiations pertaining to an award, or diminished or removed during award administration. Issuance of an award will not be made conditional based on forfeit of data rights. If the SBIR awardee wishes to transfer its SBIR data rights to the Air Force or to a third party, it must do so in writing under a separate agreement. A decision by the awardee to relinquish, transfer, or modify in any way its SBIR data rights must be made without pressure or coercion by the agency or any other party. Non-SBIR data rights less than unlimited will be evaluated and negotiated on a case-by-case basis. Government Purpose Rights are anticipated for data developed with DoD-reimbursed Independent Research and Development (IR&amp;D) funding.<br /><br />4. REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be given complete instructions on the submission process. <br /><br />VII.

<DESC>The Government intends to solicit and award through full and open competition, several Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for the purpose of procuring Manpack Radios for the Full Rate Production (FRP) phase of the program.  Manpack Radios will enable communications through seamless, high speed and digital information exchange across both vertical and horizontal hierarchies within the battlespace that supports ground, airborne and maritime domains. The Manpack Radio will support all domains for dismounted and mounted communications as a multi-functional communications platform. The Manpack Radio will provide two independent, multi-waveform channels as a software defined radio with an embedded Selective Availability Anti Spoofing Module (SAASM) to enable radios to transmit their locations to external host applications.     <br>           <br>     The current Manpack Radio requirements are stated in the Capability Production Document (CPD) for Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) Version 2.4 dated 5 April 2012 and approved on 20 May 2012.  The Government intends to procure existing and Non-Developmental Items that meet the Manpack Radio capabilities as described in the PRD.     <br>          <br>     The purpose of this RFI is to survey the ability of vendors' anticipated offerings for the Full Rate Production Manpack Radio to meet proposed changes to CPD mission weight, battery life, and range requirements.  Interested sources are encouraged to provide responses to the attached Request for Information (RFI).   This is a completely voluntary questionnaire intended to guide the Government when planning final performance requirements for the Manpack.       <br>                <br>     This notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Final Solicitation or a promise to issue a Final Solicitation in the future. This notice does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  Furthermore, the Government is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals.  Respondents are advised that the Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in responding to this notice; all costs associated with responding to this notice will be solely at the interested parties' expense.  Not responding to this notice does not preclude participation in any future Final Solicitation, if issued.       <br>          <br>     If a Final Solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website.  It is the responsibility of the potential responder to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.  If your company is interested in this planned procurement, then it is advised that you monitor the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at HTTP://WWW.FBO.GOV.      <br>          <br>     The above discussed intent is subject to change.      <br>        <br>    ---Change 1---     <br>         <br>    The purpose of this change is to provide an updated Manpack Radio request for information document for proposed CPD changes.  The updates are included in the newly added Section 3 Proposed CPD Mission Weight Detail.  Submission instructions remain unchanged from the original announcement.   <br>      <br>    ---Change 2---     <br>      <br>   The purpose of this change is to extend the submission date and revise the submission instructions for responses to the proposed CPD requirements changes.   <br>      <br>   All questions/comments pertaining to the document posted today shall be submitted no later than November 7, 2014, 12 PM ET to matthew.j.connolly1.civ@mail.mil.  Questions/comments should be in MS Office 2007 or Adobe PDF formats.  E-mail messages shall be less than 10 MB in size.  If larger files are submitted, they must be broken into separate e-mail messages.  Reference W15P7T-15-R-0004 in the e-mail subject.  All communications SHALL be submitted ONLY in writing AND directly to the email addresses identified.  Contractors shall not contact any other Government Personnel other than the person identified above.  Contacting any Government personnel other than the individual identified above could result in an organizational conflict of interest (OCI) and could result in an offeror being excluded from competition and/or award.     <br>          <br>   All communications SHALL be submitted ONLY in writing AND directly to the email addresses identified.  <br>    <br>  ---Change 3---  <br>    <br>  The purpose of this change to this announcement is to conduct a new Request for Information (RFI) for the Full Rate Production Manpack Radios. Please note that this new RFI is separate from the initial RFI posted under this announcement for solicitation number W15P7T15R0004 regarding changes to CPD requirements, which is still in effect.  <br>    <br>  The purpose of this RFI is to survey the ability of vendors' anticipated offerings for the Full Rate Production Manpack Radio to integrate onto Government specified vehicle mounts including the AN/VRC-116 Single Manpack Tray Assembly, the AN/VRC-117 Dual Manpack Tray Assembly, and the Project Manager Tactical Radios (PM TR) Manpack Universal Tray.  This is a completely voluntary questionnaire intended to guide the Government when planning final performance requirements for the Manpack.  The results of this survey are non-binding, and will be considered proprietary information, not to be shared outside of Governmental personnel.  <br>    <br>  Please see the attached document entitled  quote mark Vehicle Integration RFI quote mark  for details about the information the Government is requesting for this RFI.  <br>    <br>  To assist in responding to this RFI the Government will provide, at request, specification documents for the vehicle mounts. To obtain a copy of these specification documents, send a request via email to matthew.j.connolly1.civ@mail.mil. Include  quote mark Manpack Vehicle Integration RFI - W15P7T-15-R-0004 quote mark  in the subject line of the email request. Additionally, only U.S. Citizens shall request these specification documents and the email request for the specification documents shall provide verification that the individual requesting the documents is a U.S. Citizen.

These specification documents will not be available for request after the date and time established below for the submission of responses to this RFI.  <br>    <br>  Responses to this RFI shall be submitted no later than November 12, 2014, 12 PM ET to matthew.j.connolly1.civ@mail.mil. Responses should be in MS Office 2007 or Adobe PDF formats. E-mail messages shall be less than 10 MB in size. If larger files are submitted, they must be broken into separate e-mail messages. All communications SHALL be submitted ONLY in writing AND directly to the email addresses identified.

<DESC>W15P7T-14-R-E001 <br> Presolicitation Questions (Q) and Answers (A) <br> Received 10 January 2014 - 30 January 2014 <br>  <br> Questions received after 30 January 2014 and before 05 February 2014 will be posted separately. After February 05, 2014, no questions will be answered until after the release of the formal Request for Proposal (RFP). <br>   <br>  <br> Q11. What is the anticipated date of award? <br>  <br> A11.  The Government does not have a firm date for when the contract will be awarded. The Government anticipates the award of this requirement will most likely be 3rd or 4rd quarter of FY14, meaning most likely June - July 2014. This anticipated date is subject to change. <br>  <br> Q12. How soon after the anticipated award will vendor be required to deliver First Article units? <br>    <br> A12. The First Article Samples and Testing are to be delivered 300 days after date of award. <br>    <br> Q13. How soon after the anticipated award will the vendor be expected to deliver production units? <br>  <br> A13. The actual ordering and delivery of the Tactical Power Supplies production units would commence after the delivery of the First Article Samples and Testing.  The Contracting Officer shall provide sufficient time in the delivery schedule for acquisition of materials and components and for production after receipt of first article approval.  When Government requirements preclude this action, the Contracting Officer may, before approval of the first article, authorize the contractor to acquire specific materials or components or commence production to the extent essential to meet the delivery schedule (see Alternate II of the clause at 52.209-3, First Article Approval -- Contractor Testing).  For this particular acquisition, it is FAR clause 52.209-3, First Article Approval -- Contractor Testing, with both Alternate I and Alternate II included. <br>  <br> Q14. What are the quantities and schedule delivery requirements? <br>  <br> A14. The proposed delivery schedule for the proposed Delivery Orders (DO)s is structured in accordance with standard industry practices for production, (e.g., it considers production capacity, an initial low production rate, and long lead items). The first DO will allow 180 days after the award of the DO for the first monthly delivery of tactical power supplies.  The mix of PP-6224D/U and PP-2953E/U shall be determined by the Government at the time the DOs are issued.  The total combined delivery quantity of DOs of one or both tactical power supplies is not required to exceed 500 total tactical power supplies per month. <br>  <br> Q15. When do you anticipate the release of a formal RFQ? <br>  <br> A15. The Government will be issuing a Request for Proposal (RFP) and does not have a firm date for when the RFP will be released. We are currently anticipating that the RFP will be issued February 2014. This anticipated date is subject to change. <br>  <br> Q16. We would like to know if the above referenced SOW [DRAFT SOW/DRAWINGS/PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATION, W15P7T-14-R-E001] is eligible for set aside in part or whole? <br>  <br> A16. This requirement will be conducted on the basis of a 100% Small Business Set-Aside. <br>  <br> Q17.  Your attached survey references a technical data package. Is this different than the draft information you recently sent? Is this a build to print or new design? <br>  <br> A17.  The  quote mark Survey for Industry quote mark  had been closed since June 2012 and has been sent out for informational purposes only so that all offerors have the same information. The technical data package that was referenced in the survey is the same as the information that is currently being provided upon request to potential offerors. Please note that the documents being currently sent out are in draft format and are subject to change. This requirement is not build to print; rather it is performance based, which means the vendor will develop a design which shall meet all of the performance criteria. <br>  <br> Q18.     It appears the CECOM acquisition (initially W15P7T-12-R-A307) was transitioned to DLA (SPRBL1-14-R-0009) then transitioned back to CECOM (W15P7T-14-R-E001). Is this correct, or are there dual efforts, one being a 3 year IDIQ bridge to a former performance specification and the other being the follow-on to the bridge with the new performance specification? <br>  <br> A18. Solicitation number SPRBL1-14-R-0009 and solicitation number W15P7T-14-R-E001, (initially W15P7T-12-R-A307), are two separate efforts/notices. Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) is purchasing the previous version of the specification to provide interim Warfighter support (SPRBL1-14-R-0009), while Army Contracting Command - Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG) is purchasing the updated version with the new performance specification (W15P7T-14-R-E001). <br>  <br> If you have any questions regarding the DLA solicitation number, SPRBL1-14-R-0009, please contact:  Eric.M.Snow.civ@mail.mil.  <br>  <br> If you have any questions regarding the ACC-APG solicitation number W15P7T-14-R-E001, please contact: Roberta.C.Baldwin.civ@mail.mil.  <br>  <br> Q19.  W15P7T-14-R-E001 Notice to Industry posted January 9, 2014 solicits comments to the Draft SOW, DRAWINGS/PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATION; however, retrieving the SOW, it is footnoted with the DLA acquisition SPRBL1-14-R-0009. Should it be W15P7T-14-R-E001? <br>  <br> A19. Please refer to above question; SPRBL1-14-R-0009 and W15P7T-14-R-E001 are separate solicitation notices. In accordance with the Notice to Industry posted January 10, 2014 for W15P7T-14-R-E001, all requests for copy of the Draft Statement of Work (SOW), the five Drawings, the Performance Specification, and the Draft Exceptions to Specifications shall be e-mailed to Roberta.C.Baldwin.civ@mail.mil. E-mails shall be titled with the subject line as follows: DRAFT SOW/DRAWINGS/PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATION, W15P7T-14-R-E001.  <br>  <br> Q20.    W15P7T-14-R-E001 Notice to Industry posted January 9, 2014 advised emails be forwarded to Ms. Baldwin and Mr. Bosmans, however, Ms. Fletcher is noted as the Point of Contact. Please clarify who is the lead acquisition officer (PCO) for this effort. <br>  <br> A20.  The procurement contracting officer (PCO) is Barbara Hansen. The primary contract specialist and point of contact (POC) for this action is Roberta (Bobbi) Baldwin; the secondary POC is Brian Bosmans. All inquiries shall be directed to Roberta.C.Baldwin.civ@mail.mil and/or Brian.C.Bosmans.civ@mail.mil. No telephone inquiries will be accepted.     <br>  <br> Q21.  W15P7T-14-R-E001 Notice to Industry posted January 9, 2014 and modification January 10, 2014 do not stipulate the contract duration (originally a 5 year IDIQ to new Performance Specification MIL-PRF-49080 Rev D, then a 3 year bridge IDIQ with BEQ of 1,350 per year to a former performance specification MIL-PRF-49080 Rev B with pending Govt changes, now ???) and quantity <br>  <br> A21. The amended synopsis for W15P7T-14-R-E001 posted on December 31, 2013 on FedBizOpps states that the Government intends to award a five-year ordering period, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract. MIL-PRF-49080 Rev D, the Draft Exceptions to Specification, along with the five drawings, are the technical data package for W15P7T-14-R-E001. As stated above, W15P7T-14-R-E001 and SPRBL1-14-R-0009 are separate solicitation notices. Any questions concerning SPRBL1-14-R-0009 and MIL-PRF-49080 Revision B must be directed to the point of contact for that action, Eric.M.Snow.civ@mail.mil.  <br>  <br> Q22. To show our range of experience and examples of our custom and COTS offerings and the programs and projects we support regularly I have attached our [Company Name] Presentation.   <br>  <br> A22. The Government will not review any company presentations, brochures, diagrams or literature including specifications/model/serial/part numbers of any available products as sent as part of this presolicitation Questions and Answers. All comments and concerns should be addressed in a question format. <br>  <br> Q23. [Company Name] would like to discuss this application with your engineering team.  We have [additional technical] questions. <br>   <br> A23. Discussions with the Government engineering team are not allowed, especially since they would violate the Federal Acquisition Regulation and potentially give an unfair competitive advantage.  Only written questions may be submitted to the persons designated for receipt of questions. <br>  <br> Q24. Also, [Company Name] would like to request a copy of the current Repair Manual to provide an example of your reparability requirements. <br>  <br> A24. The Government will not release the current Repair Manual from the former contract due to solicitation number W15P7T-14-R-E001 is a new requirement. <br>  <br> Q25. CLIN Pricing Structure: <br> Will there be a separate CLIN on the contract for pre-production development, and non-recurring equipment (NRE) to support manufacturing? <br>  <br> A25.  No, there will not be a specific Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) for either of those items. The actual CLIN structure will be released with the formal Request for Proposal (RFP). <br>  <br> Q26. CLIN Pricing Structure: <br> Has the government determined the method for including FAT CLIN on the contract? <br>  <br> A26. All Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINS) for First Article Testing will be separate CLINS from the production CLINS. <br>  <br> Q27. CLIN Pricing Structure: <br> Does the government anticipate a separate CLIN be on the contract for FAT? <br>  <br> A27.  The First Article Test production units (14 Units) will have a separate Contract Line Item Number (CLIN). The associated test results and reports will be a separate CLIN. <br>  <br> Q28. CLIN Pricing Structure: <br> If so, what structure does the government anticipate using for the FAT CLIN? (CPFF, FFP, etc.) <br>  <br> A28. The Offerors' price proposal shall reflect a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) for each Contract Line Item/Subline Item Number (CLIN). <br>   <br> Q29. CLIN Pricing Structure: <br> Will the FAT CLIN be for testing only, or will the pricing include both the unit price as well as the first article testing costs? <br>  <br> A29.  The First Article Test production units (14 Units) will have a separate Contract Line Item Number (CLIN). The associated test results and reports will be a separate CLIN. <br>  <br> Q30. CLIN Pricing Structure: <br>  [Company name] is able to provide quantity price breaks as we reach economies of scale in our manufacturing process.  Will the government be including provisions allowing offerors to propose stepladder pricing to take advantage of these discounts? <br>  <br> A30. The Range Pricing spreadsheet will be attached to Request for Proposal (RFP) to allow for range quantity pricing and discounts. <br>  <br> Q31. Ref  MIL-PRF-49080D(CR) <br>    <br> Sht 13  Para  3.14.1   Identification Label Ref Fig 1: Representative PP-6224()/U  Label <br> Is a size requirement applicable? <br>  <br> A31. There are no specific dimensional requirements for the label size, but as stated in MIL-PRF-49080D the label must be compliant with MIL-STD-13231 (e.g. Paragraph 5.7 Size and form of characters) <br>  <br> Q32. Ref  MIL-PRF-49080D(CR)   <br> Para 3.3.2.1.  It appears that the immersion requirements only apply with the product cover affixed to the product. Please confirm. <br>  <br> A32. That is correct, but it should be noted that the rain test is an operational test, i.e. with the cover open. <br>  <br> Q33. Ref  MIL-PRF-49080D(CR)   <br> Para 3.3.3.3 Remote-sensing cable connector <br> In the following sentence, [The connector shall be suitable for use in fabrication at the field level of remote since cable]. What does [use in fabrication] mean? <br>  <br> A33. It means the user will connect the appropriate wiring to the connector to fabricate a cable in the field. Remote sensing is used over long cable distances where voltage regulation is critical, usually in unique applications. As such, it was decided to provide the user with the connector and instructions to fabricate a cable rather than just providing a generic cable. <br>  <br> Q34. Ref  MIL-PRF-49080D(CR)   <br> Para 3.3.5.4 Output meter <br> The output meter shall be capable of displaying DC output voltage or current. What is the required resolution for these meters? <br>  <br> A34. The resolution should be to one significant figure after the decimal. <br>  <br> Q35. Ref  MIL-PRF-49080D(CR)   <br> Para 3.3.6 DC adjustment <br> What is the required resolution for DC adjustment? <br>  <br> A35. The adjustment should be analog or to one significant figure after the decimal. <br>  <br> Q36. Ref  MIL-PRF-49080D(CR)   <br> Para 3.7.6.2 Overload protection <br> Where shall the resettable circuit breakers in the AC input circuit and the DC output circuit reside? <br>  <br> A36. An exact location is not required, but previous generations have all had the circuit breakers on the front of the power supply. <br>  <br> Q37. Ref  MIL-PRF-49080D(CR)   <br> Para 3.7.8 Remote Sense and Para 4.5.6 Remote Sense <br> The Remote sense requirement appears to be in conflict with the remote sense test. The remote sense requirement (3.7.8) is asking for 1V of remote sense. This requirement should be rewritten for clarity at some point. <br>  <br> The test of 4.5.6 will require 2V of remote sense to pass.  <br> The diagram below is how we interpret the test setup. <br>  <br> A37. The Government will not review diagrams sent as part of this presolicitation Q&A. All comments and concerns should be addressed in a question format. <br> There is no stated limit of 1V remote sense. What may be the cause for confusion is the relaxing of the requirement to 29V output at the load which is 25ft away from the power supply. This is because the power supply is only required to provide 32V, and requiring 32V at the load in this case would require a higher output voltage. <br>  <br> Q38. Ref  MIL-PRF-49080D(CR)   <br> Paragraphs 4.9.1 - 4.9.3 <br> With Safety requirement UL 60950-1, will the testing be required if the components used inside the unit are safety agency approved, but the top assembly of the item is not approved? <br>  <br> A38. Yes <br>  <br> Q39. Ref SM-D-667917 <br> Cable Assembly.  The cables that are required with the items. <br> How are they provided and shipped with the product? <br>  <br> A39. They should be provided in the same box with the power supply. Intermediate packaging may be used as appropriate. <br>  <br> Q40. Ref A328-6985 <br> Housing Assy Mounting Reqts. <br> Are there any requirements on the type of material that is used for the housing described? <br>  <br> A40. No. This is a performance based requirement. Materials chosen shall meet all requirements of the specification. For example the shock test will stress the mounts. <br>   <br> Q41: Attachment 1, Requirements for Contractor Performed First Article Testing [Sec. 3.6]: <br>  Will all FAT be conducted solely at the contractor's facility, or will government or other independent laboratory testing be required? <br>  <br> A41. First Article Testing (FAT) will be conducted at the contractor's facility or at a facility of their choice. All testing will subject to Government oversight. <br>  <br> Q42. Attachment 1, Requirements for Contractor Performed First Article Testing [Sec. 3.6]: <br> When will the First Article Test Plan [Sec. 3.6.4] be due to the government? <br>  <br> A42. See the data items A002-1 and A002-2.The data items will be provided with the official Request for Proposal (RFP) release. <br>  <br> Q43. Attachment 1, Requirements for Contractor Performed First Article Testing [Sec. 3.6]: <br> In Section 3.6.10, the SOW provides disposition instructions for 9 of the 10 FAT units.  Please confirm that, per Attachment MIL-PRF-49080D, Table I, this unit is to be destroyed upon completion of Fungus testing.  If not to be destroyed, please provide instructions for the 10th FAT unit. <br>  <br> A43. It is to be disposed of in any appropriate manner after First Article approval, or earlier with the consent of the Contracting Officer. <br>  <br> Q44. Attachment 1, Production Test Procedures [Sec. 3.6.11]: <br> Please confirm that the government intends to have Production Test Procedures be identical to First Article Testing.  Typically, FAT testing is more thorough and detailed than Production testing.  By only testing select key performance areas and eliminating or reducing the frequency of stringent testing, (environmental, thermal, EMI, and elevation, for example) costs will be reduced dramatically, and production capacity will increase. <br>  <br> A44. See paragraph 4.4 of MIL-PRF-49080D for conformance inspection requirements which are a subset of First Article tests. Note that some tests are on a sample basis or at a given time interval. When any test is required to be performed, the procedures shall be identical to First Article Testing (FAT). <br>  <br> Q45. Attachment 1, Production Test Procedures [Sec. 3.6.11]: <br> Consider allowing a Production Test Plan be presented for approval that allows an abbreviated version of the FAT tests. <br>  <br> A45. The Government intends to require all tests as described in the specification. Alternate testing requirements will not be considered at this time. <br>  <br> Q46. Attachment 1, Production Test Procedures [Sec. 3.6.11]: <br> If the government intends for the FAT and production test to be identical, please explain the relationship between Attachment MIL-PRF-49080D, Table I and the production units.  I.e. will all units be tested for all 21 items in the table, or since Electromagnetic Interference testing is only performed on 10% (1 of the 10) FAT units, will we be required to perform Electromagnetic Interference testing on only 10% of the production units as well? <br>  <br> A46. See answer number A42 above. <br>  <br> Q47. Attachment 2, Requirements for Low Pressure (Altitude) Testing [Sec. 4.6.11] <br> What leakage rate is acceptable? <br>  <br> A47. See MIL-PRF-49080D paragraph 3.10. <br>  <br> Q48. Attachment 2, Requirements for Low Pressure (Altitude) Testing [Sec. 4.6.11] <br> The defined connectors are pressure rated but not hermetically sealed. <br>   <br> A48. The specification is performance based and equivalent connectors are permitted. <br>  <br> Q49. Attachment 2, Remote Sensing [Sec. 4.5.6] <br> When using this in remote sense is there a situation where it switches over to the battery source or is this strictly an AC powered test? <br>  <br> A49. Battery changeover is not tested during this test. <br>  <br> Q50. Attachment 2, Remote Sensing [Sec. 4.5.6] <br> Our concern is that the power supply can be adjusted down to 24VDC and feed the battery input with a higher voltage while using the remote sensing cables. <br>  <br> A50. If the user requires a specific voltage other than the battery voltage, a battery should not be used in the application. <br>  <br> Q51. Attachment 2, Surge Immunity [SEC. 3.7.6.5] <br> How many joules of energy in the 2Kv surge? <br>  <br> A51. Refer to IEC 61000-4-5 for information on the test method. <br>  <br> Q52. Attachment 2, Immersion [Sec 4.6.4] Low Pressure (Altitude) [Sec. 3.8.3] Air-Seal [3.10] <br> Will the front cover from (Sec 3.3.2.1) be in place during these tests? <br>  <br> A52. Yes, the front cover may be in place. <br>  <br> Q53. Attachment 2, Weight [Sec. 3.4] <br> Will the power supply in its packaging for a total of 44lbs include the cables? <br>  <br> A53. Yes. <br>  <br> Q54. Attachment 2, Grounding Continuity [Sec. 4.9.4] <br> Is external grounding stud required? <br>  <br> A54. No. <br>  <br> Q55. [Company Name] also requests the full mechanical requirements for this power supply.  The mechanical drawings provided do not provide a complete definition of the requirements.  The A3286985 drawing does not show specific locations desired for indicators and connector interfaces. And [Company Name] would like to understand better the various installations for these power supplies related to thermal mount and thermal dissipation expected in the various environments.  Where does it get mounted? Is it always mounted the same way? <br>  <br> A55. Exact locations for indicators and connectors are not specified and it is expected that exact placement will vary among different designs. The power supply is universal in nature and has no one particular application.  <br>  <br> Q56. In drawing SM-B-667921.pdf  it mentions as copied below that this is a pressurized rated connector.  Is the power supply itself pressurized? <br>  <br> A56. The power supply is not pressurized but it does have immersion and altitude requirements. <br>   <br>  <br> Q57. In drawing SM-D-667917_80063_0001_A.pdf  is the Length defined for the final proposal phase in the bid request?  Below is the remarks from that drawing: <br>  <br> A57. Cable lengths are specified in MIL-PRF-49080D. <br>  <br> Q58. In drawing SM-D-667953.pdf  is the Length defined for the final proposal phase in the bid request?  Below is the remarks from that drawing: <br>  <br> A58. Cable lengths are specified in MIL-PRF-49080D. <br>  <br> Q59. Is power factor correction acceptable for this project?  <br>  <br> A59. As this is a minimum performance based requirement, any enhancement that is not directly in contradiction with any stated requirements would be acceptable. <br>  <br> Q60.  Paragraph 3.9.  of the spec requires that the product shall comply with the applicable emissions and susceptibility requirements from  line 3 (Aircraft, Army, Including Flight Line) MIL 461 Table V. However, the requirement mentions that RS103 shall be performed from 10kHz to 400MHz while MIL STD 461F specifies different frequency ranges.  (see below) RS101, radiated susceptibility, magnetic fields, 30 Hz to 100 kHz RS103, radiated susceptibility, electric field, 2 MHz to 40 GHz. <br> Shall we meet the spec requirements instead of RS101 and RS103? <br>  <br> A60. Yes, MIL-PRF-49080 takes precedence over MIL-STD-461 for this acquisition. <br>  <br> Q61. Do the current limits from paragraph 3.7.6.3 apply in battery backup mode as well? <br>  <br> A61. Yes. <br>  <br> Q62. Does paragraph 3.7.3 apply only for normal mode (AC voltage input)? (It is not 100% clear just from reading the spec) <br>  <br> A62. See MIL-PRF-49080D paragraph 4.5.1.2 for specific test voltage inputs. <br>  <br>

<DESC>W15P7T-14-R-E001 <br> Presolicitation Questions (Q) and Answers (A) <br> Received 30 January 2014 - 05 February 2014 <br>  <br> No additional questions will be answered until after the release of the formal Request for Proposal (RFP), with the exception of Q74 (see below). <br>   <br> Q63. Referencing synopsis W15P7T-14-R-E001, our records show no updates as of late. Can you tell me if it has been issued as a formal RFP, canceled, or awarded already? <br>  <br> A63. The Government has not issued the related Request for Proposal (RFP). When the RFP is issued, it will be announced.  All interested parties must respond to that solicitation announcement separately from this Q&A. <br>  <br> Q64. The Tactical Power Supplies PP-622D/U and PP-2953E/U has been going on for quite some time. When do you anticipate a release for the actual solicitation?  <br>  <br> A64. The Government does not have a firm date for when the Request for Proposal (RFP) will be released. We are currently anticipating that the RFP will be issued March 2014.  This anticipated date is subject to change. <br>  <br> Q65. Can we bid on this solicitation? Or this one is for preapproved sources and specific vendors only? <br>  <br> A65.  All companies that can classify as a small business under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 335999 may respond to the solicitation number W15P7T-14-R-E001 for Tactical Power Supplies. <br>  <br> Q66. I would appreciate it if you could let us know how we can get the drawings for this solicitation? <br>  <br> A66. The Government will continue to send Draft SOW, Drawings, Performance Specification, and Draft Exceptions to Specifications to all requests until further notice. If any potential offerors have not requested and received the Draft SOW, Drawings, Performance Specification, and Draft Exceptions to Specifications; please request that information as soon as possible. Please send your request to the primary point of contact (POC) for this action Roberta.C.Baldwin.civ@mail.mil. <br>  <br> Q67. We are ISO 9001:2008 certified (Please see attachment). Is this quality level acceptable for this solicitation? <br>  <br> A67.  There is not a specific quality certification or compliance level in this requirement.  In addition, the Government will not review any company certifications, forms, presentations, brochures, diagrams or literature including specifications/model/serial/part numbers of any available products as sent as part of this presolicitation Questions and Answers.  <br>  <br> Q68. Enclosed please find our form DD 2345 [Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement]. <br>  <br> A68. See above concerning forms; in addition, all comments and concerns should be addressed in a question format. <br>  <br> Q69.  We request clarification concerning the use of lubricants in the assembly.  Drawing SM D 667953 note 4 states no lubricants. Is that correct? <br>  <br> A69.  The use of lubricants is at the discretion of the vendor. Per MIL-PRF-49080D, paragraph 3.3.3.2, in reference to the above cable it states  quote mark This drawing is referenced for dimensional and interface purposes only. quote mark  As such, if all 'dimensional and interface' requirements are met, the actual assembly of the cable is up to the vendor.  <br>  <br> Q70.    Regarding drawing SM D 667917, note 5 describes an additional current path to ground by way of the connector body.  Is there a recommendation for achieving this or is it left to us to solve? <br>   <br> A70. Implementation is up to the vendor. <br>   <br> Q71. Is the output voltage to be selected by a front panel switch? <br>  <br> A71. As this is a variable voltage power supply, a switch would not be sufficient to set the voltage. The control (e.g. dial or similar) for the output voltage should indeed be on the front panel. <br>    <br> Q72. Older versions of the power supply had three ON/OFF switches on the front panel, but the new performance specification (REV D) mentions only two ON/OFF switches? <br>   <br> A72.  Only 2 circuit breakers are required as per the current specification. <br>  <br> Q73. What is the required number of front panel voltage selection switches? <br>  <br> A73.  See A71. <br>  <br> Q74. Are the drawings and specifications export controlled documents?  Are there ITAR consideration precluding us from building these assemblies in China? <br>  <br> A74. Q74 will be answered in a subsequent Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) posting.  Please continue to monitor FedBizOpps for the response to this question. <br>  <br>

INTRODUCTION <br><br>Fort Leonard Wood (FLW), a U.S. Army garrison, located in South Central Missouri is requesting, via this Request for Interest (RFI), responses from suppliers of electricity interested in submitting a proposal for full requirements power supply to FLW.  <br><br>The purpose of the RFI is to solicit information from qualified electrical suppliers to ascertain availability of capacity and interest in supplying FLW's electrical needs.  <br><br>Please note that an expression of interest in providing this energy product is neither binding nor promissory.  Responses will be used for planning purposes in determining available resources for firming Fort Leonard Wood's electrical needs.  Additionally, failure to respond to this RFI does not preclude the ability to respond to any future Request for Proposals (RFPs) for the purchase of energy products if issued at a later date.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes; it does not constitute an RFP or a promise to issue an RFP at a later date.  This RFI does not commit FLW to contract for any supply or service, nor is FLW seeking contract proposals at this time.  Responders are advised that FLW will not pay any cost incurred in response to this RFI and that all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested responder's expense.<br> <br>In light of the amount of time required for respondents to provide such information and for FLW to evaluate it, a decision as to whether to proceed with an RFP cannot be expected prior to January 2012.  <br>2. DESCRIPTION OF REQUEST: <br><br>FLW is issuing this RFI in an effort to solicit interest in the provision of wholesale, firm full-requirements energy supply, and corresponding capacity and ancillary services.  The requested power will be delivered to an interconnection or interface on the Associated Electric Cooperative, Inc. (AECI) system border.  AECI is a consumer-owned rural electric generation and transmission cooperative that provides transmission service over facilities located in the States of Missouri, Iowa and Oklahoma.  A copy of the Transmission Service Agreement between AECI and FLW is attached as Attachment 1.  AECI will provide transmission service from the AECI border to Sho-Me Power Electric Cooperative (Sho-Me).  Sho-Me will deliver the electric power from its interface with AECI to FLW.  FLW has a transmission service agreement with Sho-Me for the delivery of power.<br><br>AECI will provide to FLW, through their Open Access Transmission Tariff, two ancillary services (Scheduling, System Control and Dispatch Service and Reactive Supply, and Voltage Control from Generation or Other Sources Service).  Suppliers responding to this RFI must document how they intend to provide the other ancillary services (Regulation and Frequency Response Service, Energy Imbalance Service, Operating Reserve-Spinning Service, Operation Reserve-Supplemental Service, and Generator Imbalance Service).  Responders must have the capability, and should identify how they intend to forecast and schedule FLW's load, whether dynamically or in hourly blocks, and provide associated ancillary services. All projected costs for providing these services must be broken out and included in your response.  <br><br>Supply will begin January 1, 2013.  However, for planning purposes it is necessary to have an agreement in place no later than June 30, 2012. FLW is targeting a contract term between 1 and 5 years in length.

Q3) We do not report Acrolein which is on the target list.
A) Acrolein may be reported as a target compound or as a TIC at no extra cost.

Q4) We can achieve all required reporting limits in Table 1 via low-level SCAN mode.  Is this acceptable in lieu of SIM?  
A) Low-Level full SCAN method is acceptable in lieu of SIM provided all required SIM reporting limits in Table 1 are achieved. 

Q5) The laboratory does not offer TO-15 SIM analysis; however, we do have a TO-15 Low Level full scan method which does meet the requested TO-15 SIM reporting limits for most compounds in this solicitation.  
A) Low-Level full SCAN method is acceptable in lieu of SIM provided all required SIM reporting limits in Table 1 are achieved.

Q6) Please note that the laboratory only analyzes indoor air or ambient air samples by the TO-15 Low Level analysis.
A) SIM or Low-Level analyses shall only be performed on indoor air samples or ambient air samples. 

Q7) Method TO-15 Low-Level: The laboratory cannot achieve the requested RLs of 0.07 ppbv for chloromethane and dichloromethane. The laboratory?s RL for chloromethane and dichloromethane is 0.10 ppbv.
A)  0.10 ppbv MRLs are acceptable for Low-Level chloromethane and dichloromethane as long as the lab reports results down to the associated MDL.  Results reported between the MDL and MRL shall be qualified ?J?.  

Q8) The laboratory does not support the following compounds by method TO-15 Trace (low level): o Freon 113 (CAS # 76-13-1) o Styrene (CAS # 100-42-5) o 1,3-dichlorobenzene (CAS # 541-73-1) o Benzyl chloride (CAS # 100-44-7) o 1,4-dichlorobenzene (CAS # 106-46-7) o 1,2-dichlorobenzene (CAS # 95-50-1) o 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (CAS # 120-82-1) o Hexachlorobutadiene (CAS # 87-68-3)
A)	Low level analyses shall not be required for freon 113, styrene, 1,3-dichlorbenzene, benzyl chloride, 1,4-dichlorbenzene, 1,2-dichlorbenzene, 1,2,4-trichlorbenzene, and hexachlorobutadiene.   

Q9) For the LCS % recovery - Can the laboratory use control chart generated limits rather than 70-130%?
A) The laboratory may use their control chart generated limits as long as they are equal to or tighter than 70-130%.

Q10) Typically a canister is considered ?clean? for SCAN analyses if the analysis shows <0.2ppbv of any target analyte and less than the MRL for SIM analyses. Canister cleaning requirements clarification is needed because in the US EPA SOW p6 of 39 states canisters will be cleaned to less than the detection limit concentrations for SCAN or SIM.
A) Cleaning to <0.2ppbv for SCAN and less than the MRL for SIM or Low-Level is acceptable.

Q11) Do you have a projected schedule of sampling events and the number of cans required per event? 
A) The Govt does not have a projected schedule of sampling events and the Govt does not have the number of cans required per event. Estimates are based on previous years historical data. This does not mean the Government will order estimated amounts again.  Please refer to the guaranteed minimum set forth in the RFQ.  

Q12) Can [quoters] provide separate pricing for SCAN and SIM mode analysis?
A) See revised schedule.

Q13) Please clarify how the laboratory is to populate the surcharge SIM field.  Should there be a field for standalone SIM Pricing?
A) See revised schedule.

Q14) In the SOW it is stated that "On occasion, the project shall require reporting of compounds not listed in Table 1.   For these projects, the compounds shall be reported as Tentatively Identified Compounds (TICs)."   Can we provide separate pricing for those samples that will require TO-15 analysis and TICs?
A)  All samples shall require TICs to be reported. TICs shall be reported at no extra cost to the Govt.

Q15) Can you provide an estimate of how many samples will require TICs to be reported?
A) All samples shall require TICs to be reported.  TICs shall be reported at no extra cost to the Govt.

Q16) Can cans be batch certified or do they each need to be certified clean?
A)  All cans shall be individually certified clean at no extra cost to the Govt.

Q17) Is it acceptable to have the vacuum/pressure gauge attached to the flow controller or does the gauge need to be part of the can? 
A) It is acceptable to have the vacuum/pressure gauge attached to the flow controller. The Govt will not be charged for any restocking fee for any canister that, upon receipt, is found to have ?leaked? and lost vacuum. The lab contractor will be responsible for any return shipping fee regarding any canister that, upon receipt, is found to have ?leaked? and lost vacuum.

Q18) Please note that the laboratory does not certify the entire sampling trains for cleanliness, as only the canisters are certified.  The flow controllers do go though [sic] a cleaning process.
A) Entire sampling trains need not be certified.  It is acceptable for only the canisters to be certified provided the flow controllers go through a cleaning process.   

Q19) Are unlined passivated canisters acceptable??
A) Unlined passivated canisters are not acceptable.  

Q20) Typically clients choose 1 unit for EDDs. For EDDs, please specify the units you would like these reported in.
A)   EPA requires both units to be reported in the EDDs.

Q21) The laboratory will supply a ?CLP-like? level IV data package including a table of contents; however, the data package will not include ?DC-1?, ?DC-2?, or original documentation.
A) DC-2 is equivalent to the table of contents and this is acceptable.  Copies of original documentation, either photocopies or electronic in PDF format are acceptable.  Information included in the DC-1 may be presented in other forms (eg: laboratory narrative).

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) BEING RELEASED PURSUANT TO FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION (FAR) PART 10 MARKET RESEARCH. This RFI is issued solely for informational, market research, and planning purposes. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is not at this time seeking proposals, and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondents are advised that the USPTO will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party's expense. Please be advised that all submissions become Government property and responses to the RFI will not be returned. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if one is issued. Responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the USPTO to form a binding contract. It is the responsibility of the interested parties to monitor the Federal Business Opportunities (www.fbo.gov) site for additional information pertaining to this RFI.
<p>1.0 RFI OBJECTIVE: <br />The USPTO, as part of the White House executive actions to strengthen the quality and the accessibility of the patent system, is exploring ways to make it easier for technologists and engineers from industry and academia to provide technical training and expertise to patent examiners. See White House FACT SHEET (February 20, 2014).</p>
<p>To determine whether an invention is patentable, a patent examiner must evaluate it in light of the state of the art. But innovation moves fast and important advances may be documented only in hard-to-access corporate records or any number of other widely-dispersed repositories. The most relevant information about a particular technology in an application is sometimes difficult for examiners to locate and use. Because this information often resides with the technical and scientific community, crowdsourcing and third-party submissions are promising ways to uncover hard-to-find prior art. A growing number of organizations from a wide range of industries have expressed a willingness to help with crowdsourcing these efforts by pledging to provide public product documentation, educational materials, and other forms of "prior-art."</p>
<p>The USPTO envisions a cooperative, mutually beneficial relationship with a private or public sector firm with the objective of providing easily accessible materials that have been pledged to the USPTO through the above-described crowdsourcing effort. Industry partners and other interested parties will electronically supply materials including product documentation, educational-training materials, and other forms of "prior-art" to the USPTO on a voluntary basis or in response to requests for assistance in newly developing technological areas. These materials would be made available to both USPTO staff and to the public via the Internet at no cost to the USPTO or the public. <br /><br />The USPTO is seeking information from qualified firms that are capable of electronically receiving and potentially hosting millions of structured/indexed and unstructured documents. The firm shall index and/or add searchable metadata (e.g. keywords, author, date of public availability, etc.) to the received materials. The firm shall have the capability to provide access to a publically searchable database. Qualified firms shall provide tools and capabilities for the public to search the database containing the indexed materials. Capable firms will respond to the notice and takedown provisions codified in 17 USC &sect; 512 (Digital Millennium Copyright Act) at no cost to the USPTO or the public. Qualified firms shall have the capability to fund the ongoing operation of the infrastructure, including the maintenance of the materials and periodic updates for up to five (5) years, and perhaps longer, at no cost to the USPTO. <br /><br />2.0 ACQUISITION STRATEGY: <br />The USPTO seeks market information and suggestions on the best ways to structure any potential acquisition strategies, agreements or contracts for indexing and providing searchable access to materials being pledged to the USPTO. If the USPTO determines a requirement for the services stated in this RFI, the acquisition strategy may include solutions offered in response to this RFI. Respondents to this RFI are encouraged to identify and provide any unique solutions. Acquisition strategies being considered by the USPTO are as follows: <br /><br />a. Using a single prime contractor for hosting materials in a searchable database. <br />b. Using multiple contractor(s) for hosting materials in a searchable database. <br />c. Other acquisition alternatives and suggestions offered by industry.</p>
<p><br />3.0 INSTRUCTIONS FOR RFI RESPONDENTS: <br />RFI responses should be no longer than ten (10) pages and shall include, at a minimum:</p>
<p>1. Point of Contact Name, Company Name, Address, Email, Phone, DUNS number, and GSA FSS contract number, if applicable; <br />2. A brief capability statement with reference to each of the requirements, capabilities and acquisition strategy solutions as included herein; <br />3. An indication of whether teaming is intended, and if so, identification of each vendor involved in the team; <br />4. For each vendor involved in a response, the business size for NAICS 541519; <br />5. Past performance summary of work performed that was of similar size and scope; and <br />6. An indication of interest in responding to a solicitation, should one be issued. <br /><br />Telephone calls requesting a solicitation will not be accepted or acknowledged. Any questions regarding this RFI shall be submitted in writing to:</p>
<p>Heather.Bakos@uspto.gov and shall be received not later than 11:00 AM Contracting Officer's Local time on October 21, 2014.</p>
<p>Participation and responses to this RFI are voluntary and their source shall be treated as confidential. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested respondent's expense. The objective of this RFI is to assess vendor capabilities and interest. Review of the responses to the RFI will focus on the offeror's technical capability to provide a quality solution, corporate experience/past performance for same or similar activity with commercial activities or government agencies, and responsiveness to the RFI.</p>
<p>Interested firms who possess the above capabilities should respond no later 11:00 AM, Contracting Officer's Local time on <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DECEMBER 16</span></em></strong>, 2014. Responses received to this announcement that are marked "Proprietary" will be handled accordingly. Proprietary information submitted in response to this RFI will be protected from unauthorized disclosure as required by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). All proprietary markings should be clearly delineated. The respondent shall identify where data is restricted by proprietary or other rights and mark it accordingly.</p>
<p>Responses shall be emailed to: Heather.Bakos@uspto.gov<br />Please include reference to RFI #PTOHMB201501 in the subject line to the response and any other correspondence.</p>
<p>4.0 FORMATTING OF RESPONSES <br />Responses shall be formatted as 8.5"x11" and be not more than ten (10) pages in length. Font size should be 12 point, Times New Roman.

<p>Not responding to the RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP. If a solicitation is released, it will be issued via the Federal Business Opportunities website (www.fbo.gov). It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor this website for any information that may pertain to this RFI or a future RFP. The information provided in this RFI and any future changes to the RFI are subject to change and are not binding on the USPTO. <br /><br />5.0 POTENTIAL CLARIFICATION OF RFI RESPONSES <br />To fully comprehend the information contained within a response to this RFI, there may be a need to seek further clarification from those respondent(s) identified as capable. This clarification may be requested in the form of written communication; electronic communication; or a request for a presentation of the response to a specific USPTO group or groups. The USPTO reserves the right to seek additional information from those vendors identified with unique solutions that are determined to be beneficial to the USPTO.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this special notice is to satisfy the requirement at FAR 8.402(f) to publicize the addition of items not on the Federal Supply Schedule in accordance with FAR 5.101(a)(1) and (2).   <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Jacksonville District (SAJ) has established a Small Business Set-Aside, General Services Administration (GSA), Multiple-Award, Blanket Purchasing Agreement (BPA) in accordance with Federal acquisition regulation (FAR) 8.405-3(c)(2) under GSA Federal Supply Schedule 899-1 - Environmental Consulting Services.   <br> 		 <br> This award was made under NAICS Code 541620 - Environmental Consulting Services; the Small Business size standard for this NAICS Code is $14,000,000.   <br>  <br> GSA Federal Supply Schedule 899-1 - Environmental Consulting Services is defined as follows:  The services include, but are not limited to: Planning and Documentation Services for the development, planning, facilitation, coordination, and documentation of and/or for environmental initiatives (or mandates such as Executive Order 13423) in areas of chemical, radiological, and/or hazardous materials; ISO 14001 Environmental Management System (EMS) and sustainable performance measure development; Environmental Assessment (EA) and Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) preparation under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA); Endangered species, wetland, watershed, and other natural resource management plans; Archeological and/or cultural resource management plans; Environmental program and project management; Environmental regulation development; Economic, technical and/or risk analysis; other environmentally related studies and/or consultations; Homeland Security solutions that include Biochemical protection; Crime prevention through environmental design surveys (CPTED); Economical, technical and/or risk analysis; Identification and mitigation of threats inclusive of protective measures to mitigate the threats; and Vulnerability assessments.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR SINGLE SOURCE AWARDS IAW FAR 13.106-1
(OVER MICRO-PURCHASE THRESHOLD($3K) BUT NOT EXCEEDING THE SAT ($150K))
IAW FAR13.104, COs must promote competition to the maximum extent practicable to obtain supplies and services from the source whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government, considering the administrative cost of the purchase. When competition is not practicable, IAW FAR13.106-1(b), COs solicit from a single source for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.  COs may solicit from one source if the CO determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization). IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3),COs are required to include additional statements explaining the absence of competition (see 13.106-1 for brand name purchases) if only one source is solicited and the acquisition does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (does not apply to an acquisition of utility services available from only one source) or supporting the award decision if other than price-related factors were considered in selecting the supplier.  This template when completed can be used to document single source awards IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3).  Note: Statements such as "only known source" or "only source which can meet the required delivery date" are inadequate to support a sole source purchase.  
1. PURCHASE REQUEST OR REQUISITION NUMBER:
656-15-1-083-0003	1A. PROJECT/TASK NUMBER
	1B. ESTIMATED AMOUNT: 
$35,000.00
2. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED AND THE INTENDED USE:

Complete installations and commissioning of 20 Guldmann, Inc. GH3 ceiling mounted patient lift/mobility systems in 20 separate room locations as part of phase 3 of the Bldg 49 renovation. 

3. UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED:  . 
The patient lift systems purchased by VHASTC are manufactured by Guldmann Lift, Inc. Installation requires the physical installation of the lift system as well as final calibration and weight testing of installed equipment. 
4.  REASON THAT SUGGESTED SOURCE IS THE ONLY SOURCE, WHICH CAN PROVIDE THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES:  
No other vendor is authorized or trained by the manufacturer to install and weight test the equipment inclusive in this system. Guldmann Lift, Inc. will not support any equipment warranty or accept liability where initial installation calibration and testing were not performed by their own technicians. 

5. DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND RESULTS OR STATEMENT WHY IT WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
Extensive research was done via the internet and telephone conversations with the vendor to determine the existence of available vendors certified to install and certify Guldmann Lift, Inc. patient lift systems. Guldmann Lift, Inc. stated they have no outside source commissioned to install their patient lift systems.


6. Contracting Officer's Certification: Purchase is approved in accordance with FAR13.106-1(b). I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
