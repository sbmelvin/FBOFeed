<DESC>This is not a request for either a quote or proposal, or an invitation for bid.  The intent of this Pre-Solicitation Notice is to notify potential offerors of the Navy's requirement under RFP N40084-09-R-0020, FY08 P-180 for Wharf Utilities Upgrade at U.S. Navy Support Facility, Diego Garcia, British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT).  The project will be solicited as an unrestricted procurement using the source selection procedures in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 15.101 and 15.3.  The solicitation utilizes source selection procedures which require offerors to submit price and technical proposals. Evaluation of proposals will be based on price and technical evaluation factors as stated in the solicitation, with contract award to be made to the offeror submitting the best value to the Government.  The contract resulting from this solicitation will result in contract award to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and i! s determined to be the most advantageous to the US Government considering price and technical evaluation factors.  This project is a Design Build effort and will include but is not limited to the design and construction of upgrades to the wharf utilities to accommodate a Land Class vessel.  The work includes a steam plant consisting of 2 boilers units with gross output capacity of 3430 KW (350HP) each, steam line, and steam outlets at the wharf, site improvements and incidental work.  The work also includes, but is not limited to labor, supervision, tools, materials, and equipment necessary to perform new construction. Performance period is estimated at 20 months from notice to proceed. Estimated cost is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 236210, Industrial Building Construction with an annual size standard of $33.5M.  At time of proposal, interested parties will have to be a joint-venture between a United ! States firm (minimum 60%) and a United Kingdom firm (minimum 20%).  Anticipate a one-time Pre-Proposal Conference and Site Visit on or about the third week of April 2009 on Diego Garcia which will be restricted to registered planholder firms only.  Due to the logistical constraints posed by the location, each firm will be allowed only three attendees on the site visit.  Each request must include the following information: full name, gender, citizenship, nationality, name of firm representing, position/title, social security number, complete company and home address, passport number (place of issuance, date of issue, expiration date), and e-mail addresses.  Due to the lead time for visitors to receive area clearance to Diego Garcia it is imperative that each firm provide the above information to the Contracting Officer within 5 business days from receipt of the Request for Proposal (RFP). It is the responsibility of the planholder to arrange transportation to Singapore. A Government sponsored MAC flight will be available to transport planholder! s from Paya Lebar, Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) Base, Singapore, to Diego Garcia. It is highly recommended that flight arrangements to Singapore be changeable in the event that the scheduled MAC flight becomes delayed or encounters unscheduled changes. Failure to submit all required information by the date to be determined at the time of the issuance of the RFP will preclude the firm's eligibility to participate in the site visit and pre-proposal conference.  No additional names will be accepted after the registration deadline.
Interested offerors can view and/or download the solicitation from Navy Electronic Commerce Online at http://neco.navy.mil when it becomes available March 2009.

3. Access covers, not less than 12 inches in diameter, shall be installed in the lid of each compartment to facilitate easy access for cleaning and inspection. The covers shall be placed so that all internal piping is accessible for maintenance and inspection. The cover shall be at or near, but not below the finished grade.
