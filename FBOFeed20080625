<DESC>The Standard Procurement System (SPS) Joint Program Management Office (JPMO) has an existing SPS contract that supports the maintenance of the twenty (20) standard service interfaces to SPS.  In addition, this contract provides functional and technical support to the service Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) that are developing interfaces with SPS.  As a result, the SPS JPMO currently uses proprietary software, ETI Solution Version 5, which is provided by ETI to maintain the interfaces for the SPS suite of products.<BR><BR>The software licenses for the ETI tool are used to develop code and sustain standard service interfaces to SPS. The ETI tool is also self-documenting and hosts the SPS JPMO metastore, which is required to ensure access to the translator code and the historical repository of translator changes. The product also provides an extensive reporting capability that is used to fully document each service integration in a functional specification document.  Therefore, the SPS JPMO has a requirement to continue using the ETI software licenses for the remaining three years of the SPS contract.  <BR><BR>The Government intends to award a sole source contract, valued at approximately $464k, to ETI for a one year base period plus two one year option periods for the maintenance and license of the ETI Solution Version 5.  ETI is the only known company that can provide a renewal and maintenance of the current license.  This notice is NOT a request for proposals. The Government will not issue a solicitation.  A determination not to compete this procurement based on response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC><p>The Air Force Research Laboratory is announcing to business and academia its intent to solicit proposals under this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA). THIS ANNOUNCEMENT DOES NOT REQUEST PROPOSALS AT THIS TIME. SOLICITATIONS FOR PROPOSALS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED VIA CALLS TO THIS BAA. The over-arching strategy of the BAA involves the use of this 5-year open-ended BAA which is focused on the five Technical Directorates at Wright Research Site (Human Effectiveness, Sensors, Propulsion, Materials &amp; Manufacturing and Air Vehicles) and the two Technical Directorates at Kirtland AFB (Space Vehicles and Directed Energy). AFRL will be seeking innovation through the coupling of different disciplines in solving war-fighter needs. The objective of this BAA and future calls will be to enable the rapid formation of teams, representing diverse expertise and knowledge, to formulate and conduct innovative strategies to address complex research opportunities that impact current or projected adversary threats. The scope of the solutions sought may include some or all of the following activities: conceptualize, analyze and assess solution options including research alternatives; design, develop, fabricate and demonstrate prototypes; design, develop and conduct simulations. Results must be presented in a way to show compatibility with relevant warfighting environment. The Air Force Research Laboratory's (AFRL) Technical Directorates perform cutting edge research and development projects to support war-fighter near, mid and long term needs. To ensure these projects stay on the cutting edge of technologies a heightened emphasis has been placed on exploring both innovative technology development processes and innovative acquisition strategies. This BAA represents both of these strategies. From a technology development perspective, AFRL is seeking innovation through the coupling of different disciplines in solving war-fighter needs. This entails linking technical expertise, experience and concepts from two or more Directorates in pursuing innovative technology concepts, from traditional and non-traditional sources. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT DOES NOT REQUEST PROPOSALS AT THIS TIME. SOLICITATIONS FOR PROPOSALS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED VIA CALLS TO THIS BAA. Wright Research Site's five Technical Directorates (Human Effectiveness, Sensors, Propulsion, Materials &amp; Manufacturing and Air Vehicles) and Kirtland Research Site's two Technical Directorates (Space Vehicles and Directed Energy) have identified general technology areas that are envisioned as the development space where projects may be identified. Address technical questions to: Michael Hitchcock, AFRL/RY, 937-255-2620 or email at <a href="mailto:michael.hitchcock@wpafb.af.mil">michael.hitchcock@wpafb.af.mil</a></p>

Examples of exterior work include asphalt/concrete paving, sidewalks, curbs or gutters, excavation, waterproofing, roofing, decking, exterior painting, security fencing, or landscaping.     

JOB ORDER CONTRACT:  The contracts are unit price standard type arrangements for a one-year period with four, one-year renewal options.  The initial contract value will be $750,000, increased by modification in increments of $250,000, up to an amount not to exceed $9,500,000.  Bonding will be increased accordingly.

STATEMENT OF WORK - for the retrofit of water control structures at the Kii Unit of the James Campbell National Wildlife Refuge and Honouliuli Unit of Pearl Harbor NWR
1. GENERAL:
1.1 The Kii Unit of James Campbell National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) and the Honouliuli Unit of Pearl Harbor NWR are both part of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Oahu NWR Complex (66-590 Kamehameha Highway Rm 2-C, Haleiwa, HI 96712). The work sites are spread out to various ponds within the 134 acre Kii Unit located on the north shore of Oahu near the town of Kahuku and the 36 acre Honouliuli Unit of Pearl Harbor NWR, the former Barber's Point Naval Air Station. These refuges were both set aside specifically for the recovery of endangered Hawaiian waterbirds. The project will be designed to minimize disturbance to these endangered bird species. The site is composed of ponds and dikes. Access to the water control structures will be along the existing dikes and access roads.
1.2 The goal of this project is to construct seven (7) catwalk structures for existing water control structures based on attached schematic drawings and the specifications below:
2. SCOPE/TASKS:
 	Welding seven (7) walkways of varying length (average of 8'.)  Material used will be non-skid and constructed from aluminum. One end of the ramp will be anchored to the water control structure and the other end to the road/dike at ground level (see attached pictures).  	Decking will be a type of aluminum grip strut decking in order to provide traction when wet. 	In order to meet OSHA requirements 1910.23(c) (e), a standard railing shall consist of top rail, intermediate rail, posts, and toe board and shall have a vertical height of 42 inches nominal from upper surface of top rail to floor, platform, runway, or ramp level.  	The top rail shall be smooth-surfaced throughout the length or the railing. The intermediate rail shall be approximately halfway between the top rail and the walkway or ramp. The ends of the rails shall not overhang the terminal posts except where such overhang does not constitute a projection hazard.  	Walkway will have an access door from top of walkway to allow the opening and closing of water way (see structure schematic).  	Structures will be installed at James Campbell NWR in Kahuku and Pearl Harbor NWR in Pearl Harbor Naval Base on the island of Oahu. 	Structures will be anchored at the dike-end of the walkway via concrete foundation blocks (see attached picture). 	A chain will be included across the structure to close off access on the dike side.
3.  PLACE/DELIVERY AND PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: 
3.1 Within the 134 acre Kii Unit of James Campbell NWR is located five (5) ponds with water control structures which need this safety retrofit. Within the 36 acre Honouliuli Unit of Pearl Harbor NWR is located two (2) ponds with water control structures which also need this safety retrofit.  
3.2 The designated time frames for this project are as follows: Fabrication of the walkway structures may begin after the contract is awarded. Installation of the structure is restricted to July 31 - February 15 so as to not deter, disturb, or otherwise negatively affect nesting by the endangered Hawaiian stilt.

4.  INSPECTION AND ACCEPTANCE:
Evaluation and acceptance will be determined by the Refuge biologist or maintenance supervisor. The contractor must coordinate all work activity with these staff members. Equipment, tools, shoes, gloves, etc. are required to be clean of alien plant seeks or plant parts prior to beginning each work day on the refuge. Refuge staff may perform routine inspection of equipment, tools, and personal gear prior to work each day to minimize the importation of invasive plant species to the refuge.

5.  GOVERNMENT FURNISHED EQUIPMENT OR MATERIALS/INFORMATION:
See 2. SCOPE/TASKS:  for an email copy of the drawing you may email lorrie_gleghorn@fws.gov
6.  AVAILABILITY:
6.1 During the agreed upon work season, normal work site hours may occur any day of the week from dawn to dusk. Security of the site must be maintained by ensuring that the gate remains closed. A combination to the electronic gate will be provided to the contractor. The contractor shall provide contact information to the refuge prior to beginning work on the site, in the event of emergencies.

<DESC><p>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), plans to procure on a sole source basis services regarding Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Electronic Pathology Software, upgrades and enhancements with Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (AIM) Inc., 2 Berkeley Street, Suite 403, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5A 2W3.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12, Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13 to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 511120 and the business size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: Performance shall be for one base year plus four option years.</p>
<p>The SEER Program of the National Cancer Institute is an authoritative source of information on cancer incidence and survival in the United States.  The SEER Program currently collects and publishes cancer incidence and survival data from 11 population-based cancer registries and three supplemental registries covering approximately 14 percent of the US population.  The expansion registries increase the coverage to approximately 26 percent of the US population.</p>
<p>Utilizing information technology to automate this process is both labor saving and error eliminating when compared to current hands-on methods.  Referred to as "Electronic Pathology" or EPath, the software to accomplish such automation requires the following capabilities: (1) Pre-existing pathology reports, consisting of both text-based and coded portions of the overall report, must be searched in order to select the potential cancer cases.  Text-based portions of the report are parsed and the potential cancer cases selected through comparisons to an appropriate dictionary of reportable terminology.  Coded portions of the report are selected using a rules based process.  No standard report format exists for pathology laboratories to follow, so the software must also be flexible enough to accommodate a variety of report formats; (2) selected cases are then transmitted from the pathology laboratory to the registry.  This must include complete tracking and an audit trail.  The transmission system must be secure and conform to all HIPAA requirements; (3) once received; the information must be easily incorporated into the registry's data management operation.</p>
<p>The contractor shall:<br /> -Maintain and update the existing infrastructure<br />-Build out a portion of the remaining laboratory installations in the four new SEER registries as well as any shortfalls in the remainder of SEER<br /> -Expand to the Seattle registry <br /> -Expand ePath into the Alaska Native and Cherokee Nation registries<br /> -Expand the existing ePath system to take advantage of the new Synoptex add-on.<br />-Install Positive Case Identification software at laboratories with the SEER Los Angeles cancer registry catchment area.</p>
<p><br />Artificial Intelligence In Medicine, Inc. (AIM) is the sole-source provider of software developed to automate the review of pathology reports for cancer case finding and the forwarding of those that are required by a cancer registry.  These products are proprietary to AIM, Inc. and are unavailable through any other distributor.</p>
<p>This notice is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party has the unique capabilities, resources and personnel to perform the requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EDT, on July 7, 2008.  For further information please contact Melissa Marino, Contract Specialist via electronic mail at marinome@mail.nih.gov.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted. No faxed or emailed capability statements will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).

<DESC>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences is soliciting proposals, from all Small Businesses, for the National Toxicology Program (NTP) Technical Reports Preparation Support Services.  This notice is, in essence, a re-issuance of a notice for solicitation NIHES2008017, which was cancelled for as a result of a NAICS Code appeal.  The previous notice was cancelled after a NAICS Code appeal.  The previous solicitation was under NAICS Code 541712, Research and Development.  This notice and solicitation are under NAICS Code 511130, Book Publishers.  The Contractor shall serve as a resource to the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences for the preparation of Public Health Service documents describing NTP studies of the toxicology and carcinogenicity of selected chemicals.  The documents to be produced are generically known as Technical Reports, which are government-produced, peer-reviewed, book-style documents describing in full detail studies conducted and overseen by the NTP.  Two principal kinds of reports will be produced, differing primarily in length and the type of review process they undergo.  The first are book-length monographs (approximately 150 to 300 pages) that provide an overview of the literature on the biologic effects of a particular substance or set of chemicals and full details of the conduct, results, and interpretation of long-term (generally 2-year) NTP studies of the effects of the test chemical in rodents.  The subject matters in these reports include general toxicology, animal physiology, histologic and clinical pathology, chemistry, genetics, and statistics, and may also on occasion include pharmacology, molecular biology, immunotoxicity, developmental and reproductive toxicology, or other related disciplines.  Historically these reports have primarily consisted of Technical Reports on long-term carcinogenesis studies, but future reports, similar in size and complexity, may deal with other specialties such as reproductive or developmental toxicology.  The short reports also describe a variety of toxicity studies in rodents, generally shorter in duration.  Historically these reports have been NTP Toxicity Reports on short-term toxicity studies in rodents, but future reports may also deal with other specialties such as immunotoxicity.  These reports are generally shorter in length (50 to 150 pages) and involve the same subject areas as the long reports.   The Contractor shall work in concert, with NTP staff scientists and NTP contractors to provide technical writing, copy editing, proofreading, word processing, desktop publishing, graphics, file research, and record keeping services.  File research is broadly defined as reviewing laboratory reports and extracting relevant experimental information and also capturing, downloading and reformatting files of tabular data.  The Contractor shall engage in report preparation activities, at the direction of the Project Officer, for approximately 40 reports in various stages at one time.  Each report will be prepared in a series of five or four drafts, each incorporating text, materials, and revisions from NTP staff.  Each report will be presented for outside peer review at one of the intermediate draft stages; some reviews of Technical Reports are conducted in public session.  The Contractor shall provide review draft reports for each draft stage and shall also prepare desk top publishing files for use by the Government and PDF and/or HTML files for display on the NIEHS World Wide Web servers.  Approximately 24 reports shall be presented for review and printed each year; the Contractor should expect to commence preparation of approximately two reports per month and to deliver approximately two drafts per week.  The Contractor should be prepared to provide flexibility in scheduling deliverables, in consultation with the Project Officer, to accommodate Program needs, particularly to accommodate the presentation of several (as many as eight to ten) reports for review at one time. The contractor shall archive all materials received, maintain a log of all materials received and delivered, and submit a biweekly status report detailing the status of each report in preparation and the cumulative labor hours spent on each report.  All materials sent to the Contractor are considered the property of the Government, and are not be used for any other purpose.  Each report shall follow a standard format and will contain a cover page, various front matter, (e.g. Note to the Reader; Title Page; Tables of Contents, Figures, and Tables; lists of contributors; and in later drafts, lists of reviewers and summary of reviewers comments and an overall summary) separate sections for an Abstract, Introduction, Materials and Methods, Results, Discussion, References, and various Appendixes.  Page layout will include text, tables (both embedded in pages of text and multi-page data sets), line art graphics, and photomicrographs with captions.  In various drafts, text may have different spacing and columniation.  Pages will carry headers and/or footers identifying the report by name and number, draft status, and page number.  At various draft stages the page numbering may be either numerically consecutive from the front or alphanumeric for individual appendixes.  Contents and format requirements are subject to periodic revision by the Program and the Project Officer.  Examples of currently produced reports are available for view under NTP Study Reports on the NTP website http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov.  Reports are to be prepared with suitable software publishing package with the capability to incorporate the entire report, including all headings, text, tables, line art images, and photomicrographs, into a single file.  The Contractor shall be able to produce hard copies, electronic files, and Portable Document (PDF) files of the entire report, or sections thereof, for use by the NTP.   The contractor shall provide Section 508 Compliant web-optimized PDF files for those draft stages that will be placed on the NTP web site.  The Contractor shall be able to receive and capture electronic files with text, graphics, and tables from a variety of sources, platforms, and programs.  Electronic data accessing methods will include reading disks, e-mail attachments (originating both from Macintosh and PC platforms), and World Wide Web sites.  These files may be in a variety of formats and programs, including but not limited to MS Word (various versions) for text files, Excel spreadsheets, and TIFF (Tagged Image File Format), GIF, or JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) files for photographs.  The Contractor should also be able to read and capture text with citations incorporated in reference libraries (e.g., EndNote).  The Contractor shall be responsible for ensuring the accuracy of transcription of any electronically converted or hand-keyed text or data.  On occasion the Contractor may be asked to prepare graphical displays of data (e.g., time plots or bar graphs) or chemical structures and metabolism pathways.  These should be prepared as transportable files with programs such as Photoshop for line art, Freehand for graphics, and Chem Draw or ISIS/Draw for chemical structures and not be embedded in a proprietary format.  The contractor shall have the capability of scanning line art graphics (e.g., chemistry spectra, schematic diagrams) into electronic files at a resolution of 600-1200 dpi.  In the event that photographs (rather than digital files) of photomicrographs are provided, the contractor shall have the capability of scanning the photograph at the original quality and producing a TIFF file at a final resolution of 300 dpi for color images or with gray tones for black and white images.  For all graphics the contractor shall use programs that capture the required information in a file format without loss of quality of the image. During the report preparation process the Contractor shall be able to extract portions of entire sections or the report and send them as electronic files to NTP staff for review.  The Contractor will certify that a written enforced administrative process to identify, manage, reduce and eliminate conflicting financial interest is currently in effect.  The anticipated effective date of the subsequent award is January 1, 2009.  The performance period for the base contract is expected to be 60 months.  Should the Government choose to exercise the time extension options for continued support; the period may be extended to December 31, 2019.  For estimating purposes the Government anticipated an approximate level-of-effort of 12 person-years per year for the length of the contract and for each one-year extension option.  The Government anticipates the participation of a principal investigator, a production supervisor, senior science writers, technical writers/copy editor, desktop publishing specialists and clerical staff.  There is no prescribed mix of writers/editors and or desktop publishing specialist, but rather bidders should develop a strategy and team they feel is appropriate for performing the required task.  The expected release date of the RFP is July 10, 2008 with proposals due August 11, 2008 (per FAR 5.203(e)).  Interested organizations should request a copy of the RFP in writing from David C. Sedgley, Contract Specialist, P.O. Box 12874, 79 T.W. Alexander Drive, Building 4401, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709; by telephone (919) 541-4027 or by FAX request (301) 435-2709.  On the release date an online version of the RFP will be available on the internet in a PDF format attached to this synopsis.  The proposed contract is 100% set aside for small business concerns.

<DESC>Responses to this Broad Agency Annoucement (BAA) are sought to demonstrate aerospace Mini-RF advanced technologies.  The key focus for these demonstrations is to miniaturize/integrate the RF modules allowing for more sensors to be utilized by the various platforms.  The purpose of this announcement is to support Aerospace Mini-RF Advanced Technology Program Demonstrations for Department of Defense (DoD) and other Government programs.  The Signals Warfare Mini-RF team, Code 452400D, Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD), will survey the Mini-RF technologies that are currently available or will be available in the near future that will meet current and future program needs.  NAWCWD will award contracts based on current program needs and/or will select Mini-RF technologies that could provide a significant technology push for DoD and DoD related programs.  To fulfill its mission, the Aerospace Mini-RF technology team may require the Contractor to support and/o! r transition the advanced concept(s) developed under these contracts to a source for fabrication, integration, and/or demonstration.  The goal of the Aerospace Mini-RF Advanced Technology Program is to demonstrate the feasibility of affordable multifunction/integrated miniature RF technologies that can be utilized on various aerospace platforms.  Thus, the Aerospace Mini-RF technology team takes a systems engineering approach to identify the key RF related technology concepts that exhibit sufficient potential for future development efforts.  The Aerospace Mini-RF Advanced Technology Program Demonstrations will integrate modules and components with various RF functionalities, and demonstrate the performance and technical potential of these components.  Proven integrated concept components may be retained as part of future demonstration systems or transitioned to operational systems. The major objective of the program is the rapid concept development and demonstration of reliable Mini-RF aerospace sensors.  Functional sensor areas for the Mini-RF technologies to be addressed include but are not limited to:   a. Mini-RF sensors b. Mini-RF Communication (Comms) Subsystem c. Mini-RF Integrated Sensor and Communication Subsystem  d. Mini-RF Multi-Function Sensor Contracts to be awarded under this BAA shall require work specified in one or more of the functional sensor areas contained in this announcement.  The Contractors are expected to submit White Papers on one or more of the following module/component technologies within any functional sensor area.  Some very basic requirements have been identified; however, it is the Government's intent to focus on advanced lightweight technologies that can be used for advanced lightweight aerospace demonstrations. a. Wideband Transmitter Power Amplifiers       - Frequency Range 2 - 18 GHz      - Frequency Range 2 - 8 GHz      - Frequency Range 6 - 18 GHz      - Peak Power out (RF) 20W - 1 KW b. High efficiency Transmitter Power Amplifiers      - S Band, X Band, Ku Band c. Receivers (analog and/or digital) and Processors      - Up to 750 MHz input bandwidth d. Waveform Generators e. Synthesizers      - Miniature design with various tuning steps f. Wideband and Lightweight Antennas      - Frequency Range 2 - 8 GHz  6 - 15 GHz   g.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center (NAVFAC ESC) under FAR 6.102(d)(2). This announcement is open until 1 June 2009 in which NAVFAC ESC is seeking technologies and methodologies to prevent concrete deterioration from alkali silica reaction (ASR).  ASR has resulted in significant damage to Department of Defense (DOD) airfield pavements, with expenses in the tens of millions of dollars at each airfield.  So far over 30 airfields have reported significant problems.  While mitigation of existing ASR deterioration may be considered, the main emphasis of this announcement is on prevention of deterioration.  Work under this award will be conducted in up to five (5) phases, with each of the phases costed and negotiated separately, and lasting approximately not more than one year each. All five phases may not be awarded nor may all phases be awarded in consecutive order.  The announcement for this award is for abstracts only, of approximately five (5) pages or less of technical material. The abstracts will outline the topic(s) of interest selected and the phased approach proposed.  The abstract may be supplemented by resumes and list of publications relevant to this announcement which will not count against the five (5) page limit. The initial award will be made for Phase I only and is estimated for up to $100K.  Abstract emphasis should be on the proposers Phase I effort with subsequent phases identified more broadly. Multiple awards may be made under this announcement.  
Topics of interest described below are provided as guides to areas that may be included in your abstract for the various phases. It is not expected that any individual abstract will include all topics, nor is it expected that abstracts limit their approach to only the areas specified in the topic list.
Individual topics of interest are as follows:(a)	Develop a methodology for determining the suitability of fly ashes with high calcium oxide contents to prevent concrete ASR deterioration.  Current DOD guidelines limit fly ash usage to Class F ashes with additional limits on their composition.  Recent DOD research had shown that Class C ashes close to Class F ashes could be used, but further assessment of effects of the deleterious components in Class C ashes is needed.(b)	Recent DOD research has shown the effect of fly ash chemical composition on its effectiveness to prevent ASR.  However this research was limited in terms of the available data and needs further validation using a wider sample of U.S. sources, as well as sources from contiguous geographical areas.(c)	Class N natural pozzolans and calcined clays have also shown effectiveness in mitigating ASR.  However, some pozzolans may not be as effective as fly ashes with similar chemical composition.  Further assessment of pozzolans is needed.(d) 	Ground granulated blast furnace slag (only grades 100 and 120 are considered) can be effective in preventing ASR, but at higher replacement amounts than fly ash.  Unlike fly ash, slag can be efficient at preventing ASR even at high CaO contents.  Hence further investigation into slag effectiveness based on chemical composition, which is different than for fly ash, is needed.(e) 	For both fly ash and slag, effectiveness in preventing ASR may also be linked to mineralogy, not just chemical composition.  Further assessment of mineralogy and its potential effect on current assessments based on chemical composition are needed.(f) 	Fly ash fineness has been shown to be a significant factor in preventing ASR.  Fineness needs to be combined with chemical composition to develop a joint metric for effectiveness.(g)	Since both fly ash and slag can prevent ASR, combinations of both are expected to be effective as well, and this is reflected into current DOD specifications.  Such binary (or tertiary) blends can also improve the concrete strength gain rate.  Further correlations between ash content, slag content, and concrete strength gain rate are needed. (h)	ASTM C 1260 and C 1567 are currently used by the DOD to prevent ASR.  The DOD expansion threshold was initially 0.08% at 14 days, which is more conservative than ASTM recommendations, but recent research suggests that 0.08% at 28 days would be more representative of actual field behavior.  Further insight into this lower threshold and its attainability with supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs), as well as comparison with other field or test data (e.g. ASTM C 1293 at 2 years) are sought.(i)	Recent efforts by FHWA, FAA, and the Army are looking at the effectiveness of lithium nitrate topical applications to mitigate existing ASR.  Assessment of lithium nitrate application would enable the determination of this methods ability to control expansion, and, in particular, the determination of the cost-effectiveness of topical lithium applications versus pavement replacement.  (j)	Rubblization and crack and seat technologies at ASR affected airfields as alternative cost effective repair/reconstruction techniques (to removing and replacing) need to be evaluated.  These techniques involve cracking or breaking the existing concrete into small particles and overlaying with asphalt.  However, the effects of continued deterioration and expansion of the cracked ASR-affected concrete need to be evaluated before these techniques can be used.
A NAVFAC ESC technical review board will evaluate the abstracts to this BAA.  The abstracts will be evaluated based on the following CRITERIA (listed in descending order of importance):  (1) the scientific/technical merits and objectives of the abstract;  (2) the contractor's capabilities related experience, techniques, or unique combination of these that are integral factors in achieving the contractor's proposed objectives; (3) the qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the principal investigator, team leader, or key personnel who are critical in achieving the objectives of the abstract; (4) the cost relative to the proposed scientific/technical approach, and (5) the applicability of the conclusions to guidance and criteria.  Subsequent to review, the NAVFAC ESC technical Board may request a full scale Proposal of no more than 25 pages. NAVFAC ESC may share the abstracts and the proposals with other DOD personnel of offices associated with this topic.  Information that is sensitive or proprietary must so be marked page by page in the abstract and or proposal. Multiple awards may be made. The request for a proposal does not obligate the government in awarding a contract.  CRITICAL NOTE: A CONTRACTOR IS REQUIRED TO REGISTER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (CCR).  NO CONTRACT AWARD WILL BE MADE TO ANY CONTRACTOR THAT IS NOT REGISTERED OR IN THE PROCESS OF REGISTERING WITH THE DOD CCR.  THE DOD CCR MAY BE REACHED AT (888) 227-2423, OR WEBSITE WWW.CCR.GOV.  THERE IS NO COMMITMENT BY THE NAVY EITHER TO MAKE ANY CONTRACT AWARDS OR TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY MONEY EXPENDED BY THE CONTRACTOR BEFORE A CONTRACT AWARD.  Any information that may be sensitive to review by such personnel should not be submitted.  Eligibility notification will be sent to all contractors, who have submitted an abstract, after the Navy's Technical Evaluation Board (TEB) has reviewed all abstracts submitted by an internal periodic cut-off date.  The internal periodic cut-off date may occur several times within the period from the BAA announcement to the closing date for receipt of abstracts. Abstracts may be submitted at any time but to ensure review by the first meeting of the Technical Evaluation Board (TEB) abstracts should be received by July 31st, 2008. Abstracts received after this date will be evaluated by subsequent meetings of the Technical Evaluation Board (TEB) with such subsequent awards being made dependant upon results of evaluations and budgetary constraints.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516   BACKGROUND:NAICS Code: 334516 Currently Radiation and Indoor Environments (R&IE) National Laboratory maintains radiological instruments and equipment to meet Homeland Security defense capability for radiological emergency response requirements and as EPA first responders of the Radiation Emergency Response Team (RERT) requires routine field radiation assessments.  Field operation personnel might be required to take reading and measurement in the location and in order to obtain these reading specialized field handheld instruments will be utilized.  The handheld instruments are considered mobile, lightweight, and versatile when it comes to field support equipment.  The Office of Radiation and Indoor Air, Radiation and Indoor Environments National Laboratory (ORIA/R&IE) in conjunction and collaboration with the Office of Radiation and Indoor Air, Washington D.C., and Office of Radiation and Indoor Air, National Air and Radiation Environmental Laboratory (ORIA/NAREL) is continuing its effort to provide defensible radiological analytical values to the Public and other Governmental Agencies.  R&IE supports Superfund projects in cleanup, removal, remediation, and radiological emergencies.  EPA under the National Response Framework (NRF) and other federally-mandated regulations would be tasked as the primary and coordinating agency for specific radiological emergency responses.  ORIA/R&IE is requesting to purchase specialized detection equipment to be used during RERT deployment.  The detection equipment will be used to determine reading specific to radiation detection.  The type of instrument requested is the state of the art Canberra Inspector 1000 that provides high resolution (<3%) for gamma radiation identification and approximate quantification with additional detection for neutrons. CANBERRA INSPECTOR 1000 DIGITAL HANDHELD MULTICHANNEL ANALYZER MCA system that incorporates the LaBr detectors and neutron probes (IPRON-N) together in on complete system. R&IE currently maintains approximately 250 various instruments and this requested purchase is to maintain consistency for training, calibration, maintenance, and Standard Operating Procedures.  The high resolution hand held Multi-Channel Analyzer (MCA) is for the EPA first responders of the Radiation Emergency Response Team (RERT) and routine field radiation assessments.  Canberra Multi Channel Analyzer is the only MCA with source-less compensation required for energy stabilization.  Canberra Multi Channel Analyzer is the only MCA compatible with GENI 2000 data software used for all RERT gamma analysis.   A determination not to compete the proposed Purchase Order based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All questions should be directed to Rasheda Sherron via email at sherron.rasheda@epa.gov.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 511210   The US EPANational Enforcement Investigations Center (NEIC), under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Rules (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Vertere Inventory Control Systems of Portsmouth, RI forVertere Inventory Manager software, a one year software maintenance contract, training, installation and hardware options.  The justification is as follows.  NEIC develops and implements innovative techniques, practices, and procedures using its scientific and technical expertise, devises specialized methods and/or technical field applications, and transfers these capabilities to state, local and Federal environmental enforcement and compliance assurance programs.  Consequently, there is a need for automated inventory support with barcodes, fast and accurate report generation and accurate reporting to local emergency response personnel in regards to risk level assessments.  The Vertere Inventory Manager has gained near uniformity across the EPA laboratory system.  Currently, nineteen laboratories use the VIM software, including nine of the ten regional EPA laboratories.  Uniformity in inventory management allows for the potential for the integration and sharing of information between the laboratories at a later date.  VIM software was recommended for Agency use in order to facilitate chemical inventory and tracking.  NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE IS AVAILABLE.  Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting this requirement may submit a response, which if received within two days of the closing date of this announcement, will be considered.  Responses to this announcement must be in writing to daniels.ryan@epa.gov.

<a href="mailto:schopler.angela@epa.gov">ANGELA M. SCHOPLER</a>
<DESC>The EPA has a need for a contractor to provide support to the EPA?s Office of Water, Office of Wastewater Management (OWM), in supporting the implementation of water-efficiency programs.  In 2006, EPA launched a voluntary public-private partnership program that seeks to protect the future of the nation?s water supply by promoting water efficiency and enhancing the market for water-efficient products, services, systems, and practices.  This market-enhancement program helps end-users identify water-efficient products and programs. The WaterSense? label indicates that these products and programs meet water-efficiency and performance criteria. WaterSense labeled products perform well, help save money, and encourages innovation in manufacturing.  The contractor?s efforts will broadly support the EPA?s efforts to increase water efficiency in the U.S.
The successful contractor will be expected to provide technical and administrative support services to aid the Agency in the following task areas primarily in the water efficiency arena: market transformation strategy development; technical analysis of programs and products; voluntary specification development for products, programs, and/or services; general voluntary program support; market/industry analysis; partnership development; product certification and conformity assessment; tracking, evaluation & analysis; marketing and outreach; consumer education; customer service/relationship management;  recognition; website development and maintenance; and general outreach materials development such as, case studies, newsletters, slide shows, brochures, videos, public displays, etc.  
The resulting contract will include management of multiple, concurrent workassignments which will require long-term as well as quick turn-around responses essential to the responsibilities of the Office of Water within the WaterSense programs.  This will be a performance based acquisition including a performance work statement and quality assurance surveillance plan.  The anticipated contract type level-of-effort, cost-plus-fixed-fee contract consisting of a base period performance of twelve months, followed by four (4) optional performance periods of 12 months each.  
The base period will consist of a maximum amount of 47,500 professional direct labor hours, with 32,500 base direct professional labor hours plus 15,000 optional quantity direct labor professional hours. Option period one, two, three and four will each consist of a maximum amount of  47,500 professional direct labor hours, with  32,500 base direct professional labor hours plus 15,000 optional quantity direct labor professional hours.  There will be a maximum potential combined total of 237,500 direct labor professional hours, base and all optional quantities, over the potential five (5) year life of the contract.

<DESC>Small Business Set-Aside
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires professional architect and engineering services to support remedial planning and oversight activities in Region 9 which includes California, Nevada, Arizona, Hawaii, Guam, American Samoa, the Territories in the Pacific and Tribal Land.  The services include site management; remedial investigation feasibility studies; engineering services to design remedial actions; engineering evaluation and cost analysis for non-time critical removal actions; construction management for implementing remedial actions and non-time critical removal actions, including issuing and managing subcontracts for construction of the selected remedy and engineering services in overseeing construction; enforcement support, including oversight of remedial investigations/feasibility studies, remedial design and remedial action, and negotiation support; and other technical assistance, including community relations, sampling and analysis support, and pre-design investigations.  Services may include technical and management services supporting EPA's coordination and oversight of remedial actions where they are performed by a state, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, or responsible parties identified in enforcement actions. 

The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 562910 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  At least fifty (50) percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the prime contractor.  
This procurement envisions the award of two (2) Response Action Contract (RAC), one under full and open competition and one small business set-aside.  This announcement pertains to the small business set-aside.  The unrestricted/full and open competition project is issued under a separate announcement.  The contracts will be firm fixed rate, Indefinite Delivery/ Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) award term contracts.  The base period of performance will be three (3) years, with three  award terms periods, two (2) year, three (3) years and two (2) years, for a potential total period of ten (10) years.  Work will be issued by Task Orders.  The total estimated of this proposed contract, including award terms, is $110,000,000.00.  The Government reserves the right to issue multiple awards under either of the procurement announcements, the unrestricted and/or the small business set-aside.
The contract will be awarded in accordance with the Brooks Act Procurement procedures.  For this procurement, EPA requires that the offerors organize the information so as to highlight responses to the technical Evaluation Criteria.  Firms interested in responding to this announcement are invited to submit completed Standard Form 330 (SF 330) to the office shown below by June 29, 2007, 2:00 PM Pacific Time.  Responses must be received at the designated Region 9 location by the deadline; postmarks will not suffice.  Responses to this announcement, including SF 330 and all attachments, shall not exceed fifty (50) pages.  No alterations to the SF 330 are permitted. The response should be single sided, with a minimum of 10 point font, 8.5 X 11 only (no other size page(s) will be allowed).  This page limit does not include the cover letter, the front and back cover of the SF 330, tab/divider pages or the table of contents.  There is no page limitation for any individual section or portion of the SF 330 or attachment(s), the only limitation is the overall page limitation stated above. Offerors shall follow the instructions for completing the SF 330. Offerors whose response exceed the page limitation and do not comply with instruction provide will be non responsive.  Submit one (1) original and seven (7) copies, a total of eight (8), and one (1) electronic copy on disc in the following formats (Word Perfect, MS Word) of  your response to the following address:  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Region 9, Contracts Section: Attn: Paul Casagrande MTS-4-3, 75 Hawthorne St., San Francisco, CA 94105.  
	
	There is no prohibition against a firm participating in both the RAC full and open competition and the RAC small set-aside.  All proposals will be evaluated in an identical manner and in accordance with specified evaluation criteria.   The Government does not envision awarding contracts to a respective firm that would be the Prime or Sub-contractor in both the full and open and the set-aside procurements.  Pursuant to FAR 36.6, the source selection official has the latitude to consider selection of another of the ranked offerers.  Rationale for considering such action could be the Governments goal to provide alternate sources for its requirements, including the mitigation and management of conflict of interest (COI) issues.  In the event that firms propose under a joint venture agreement, both firms must demonstrate the ability to implement the requirements of the tasks described in the Statement of Work independently. 

	The EPA Region 9 is not going to hold a pre-proposal conference.  This announcement is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  However, the RFP will be posted shortly on the EPA web site for informational purposes only.  A bidders list will not be provided or posted.  Following EPA's review of the SF 330, a "short list" of the most highly rated firms will be developed.  Short listed firms will be referred to as "selected firms."  Selected firms will be invited to participate in oral presentations.  The specific details on the oral presentations will only be provided to the selected firms.  Selected offerors should be aware that their overall rating depends on both written submissions and their oral presentations.  Following oral presentations, the proposals will then be ranked and the source selection authority will make the final selection from among those firms.  The most highly rated firm will be asked to submit a cost proposal, Conflict of Interest Plan, Quality Management Plan and Representations and Certifications.  The contractor will also be required to have an acceptable accounting system that allows for segregation and tracking of costs.

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate a sole source purchase order under Simplified Acquisition Procedures to IN/US Systems, 5809 North 50th Street, Tampa, FL 33610 for the acquisition of a B-RAM Model 4B Micro Fast LC Detector. This instrument is needed to measure radioactivity from an ultra high pressure liquid chromatography (UPLC) system. The B-RAM Model 4B has a small footprint (only 348 x 152 x 330mm) and can accommodate the latest UPLC techniques. This instrument also has a broad dynamic range over 5 orders of magnitude. Because the B-RAM Model 4B can detect small peaks in the presence of large peaks, it is the most sensitive radiodetector for fast liquid chromatography. The B-RAM Model 4B can also operates low flow pumps (down to 200ul/min) to increase the sensitivity in detection of radioactivity. IN/US is the only company that makes a radiodetector that EPA research requirements of small footprint, detects gamma and beta emitters, and can operate at a low scintillant flow rates (200ul/min). This instrument will a vital role in that it will allow fast and more precise liquid chromatography analysis. The EPA has identified IN/US Systems as the only vendor capable of satisfying this requirement. The circumstance permitting "Other than full and open competition" is FAR 13.106-1 (b) only one source reasonably available.  The intent of this notice is to determine if any other source(s) exist; and therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available.  Consequently, any response failing to provide the aforementioned data and instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will be ignored.  The information received in response to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.

DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The OWH has 13 very different ASIST2010 programs serving diverse populations and located in diverse organizations.  The goals of the ASIST2010 program are to:  1) Support existing public health systems/collaborative partnerships that add a sex and gender focus to the selected HP 2010 Focus Areas and objectives identified above, and 2) Provide additional support to HP 2010 objectives that track the health status of women to help them move towards their targets. It is anticipated that the contract will be for a period of 26 months.  This is a presolicitation notice, not a solicitation.

The contractor will produce geologic maps of western Oregon and Washington used to define potentially active faults and sources of earthquake and volcanic hazards.  Access to these data in a systematic geologic map database is essential to understanding the processes of crustal deformation, structure and history, and provides a framework for assessing hazards from crustal faults and resource potential.  This requirement is an extension of geologic mapping that was previously performed by the contractor.  The contractor has the essential technical expertise in the development of geologic mapping in these quadrangles to complete the required task, and is the only source in possession of the data necessary to revise the original maps.  The Government intends to award this requirement noncompetitively in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) under the Simplified Acquisition Threshold of $100,000.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, but interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement to the Purchasing Agent via e-mail (pcharles@usgs.gov) no later than the response date shown in the announcement.  The RFQ will be unrestricted under NAICS code 541360, size standard $4.5 million.

Special Operations Command intends to contract with AAI Corporation, Hunt Valley, MD for two (2), Advanced Boresight Equipment (ABE) System Test Kits for use with MH-60L/M Direct Action Penetrator (DAP), MH-60M Assault and MH-47G helicopters for the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR) Airborne (A).  The purpose of this requirement is to acquire an advanced state-of-the-art boresight technology system that will support Special Operations Forces (SOF) equipped helicopters at the 160th SOAR (A), provide a boresight test capability that will not require the aircraft to be lifted prior to operation, as the current test set requires, and to support repair and trouble shooting capabilities for the aircraft armament system.  The system must be light weight because of the deployment requirement, without requiring recalibration of equipment by field representatives in the field prior to use.  The system must not have a “line of sight” requirement. The system must be compatible with all aircraft stated above with minimum adaptations and time required for the change.  The Government intends to contract with AAI Corporation for this requirement on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  The period of performance shall be 432 calendar days after receipt of order with no option years.  AAI is the designer, developer and manufacturer of the ABE Model 310A and owns all proprietary data for the equipment. This is a DO-A1 rated contract.  The solicitation number is H92241-08-R-0027. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 336413; the business size is over $17,000,000.00 and the average number of employees is over 1,000.  Equipment shall be delivered to Ft. Campbell, KY.  All interested parties must contact the listed POC for this requirement by 11 July 2008, 2:00 PM local time and should be addressed to:  Technology Applications Contracting Office, Attn: AMSAT-D-TK (Attn: Stanford Williams), Lee Blvd., Building 401, Ft.

Mukuka L. N. Zimba; Permanent Secretary; Ministry of Communications and Transport; P.O. Box 50065; Lusaka, Zambia; Phone: 260 21 1254158; Fax: 260 21 1251795 


Zambia: Airports Master Plan Feasibility Study.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for the Zambia Airports Master Plan.

Zambia’s civil aviation sector has experienced explosive growth during recent years, with passenger traffic volumes growing between five and six percent at major international airports. This growth is projected to continue. The aviation infrastructure is vital for the country’s economy as it facilitates increasing tourism to the Victoria Falls region and supports the mining industry in the copperbelt region. However, the existing infrastructure of the airports is not sufficient to handle the projected increase in demand.  

Zambia has three major international airports: Lusaka, Ndola, and Livingstone. Lusaka was established as a commercial airport while Ndola and Livingstone were originally established for government use and later transformed into civil and commercial use facilities to support trade and mining activities in the Copperbelt region and tourism traffic to Victoria Falls respectively. There is a fourth smaller international airport that is growing in importance which is the Mfuwe airport that services the Luangwa Valley.  

Lusaka:
Lusaka International Airport is the hub for passenger, aircraft and cargo operations in Zambia. It is situated approximately 27 kilometers east of the central business district of the city of Lusaka. The airport, which was established in 1967, has seen significant increases in air traffic in recent years and it is estimated that passenger traffic will continue to grow at a rate of four to five percent per year during the next five years. Passenger traffic at Lusaka is composed mostly of international passengers (85% in year 2005). Aircraft movements and cargo traffic have also increased steadily at Lusaka International Airport. 

Ndola:
The modernization of the Ndola International Airport is needed not only due to the increase in traffic resulting from tourism, but also due to the large investments in copper mining in the region. Ndola International Airport was built during World War II to serve as a military post and was later converted into a commercial facility to facilitate trade in the copperbelt region. The airport is located in the city of the same name, the second largest in Zambia, and the main hub for mining activity in the country. Mining investments in the area in the next five years should exceed three billion dollars. This level of business will demand the expansion and modernization of the Ndola Airport to allow the operation of larger aircraft. 

As in the case of Lusaka, air traffic at Ndola International Airport has increased in the range of five to six percent per year during the last five years and is composed of two thirds international passengers and one third domestic passengers. The National Airports Corporation Limited (NACL) has estimated that passenger traffic in the next five years will grow at a rate of four to five percent per year and will exceed 100,000 passengers per year in 2009.

Livingstone:
Traffic at the Livingstone Airport is projected to increase at approximately 10% per year for the next five years. The airport is located in an area of tourism development servicing tourists visiting Victoria Falls. New hotels, resorts, restaurants and other related facilities have been established in the area during recent years. 

Mfuwe:
Mfuwe airport recently achieved international status and plans are afoot for international airlines to fly directly to Luangwa Valley.  South Luangwa is one of the most impressive wildlife sanctuaries in the world due to the concentration of game around the Luangwa River.

NACL: 
In 2000, NACL created an Airports Development Plan for the years 2000-2005. As of 2006, NACL had completed several improvements at the three major airports, estimated at a $70 million, as a part of the company’s Development Plan.  These investments corresponded to about 100% of the planned improvements for Livingston, approximately 75% of the planned improvements for Lusaka and approximately 25% of the planned improvements for Ndola. The modernization and improvement projects had included mainly upgrades in the physical security of the aerodromes, modernization of the check-in areas and electronic ticketing capability, compliance with the International Civil Aviation Organization and the International Air Transport Association regulations and recommendations to assure airport certification from these international organizations. 

This track record demonstrates that NACL is capable of defining reasonable development plans and implementing them. This is the major reason United States Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) is confident that the new USTDA-funded planning effort will be put to good use in Zambia. Despite the mentioned progress, many other improvements are necessary to cope with the increasing demand. NACL and airport authorities have been working in an efficient manner towards this goal and have identified priority developments for the airport for the period of 2006-2010. Some of the identified priorities include:
•Upgrade of security systems; 
•Rehabilitation of fire stations; 
•Replacement of  standby generators; 
•Rehabilitation of international departure area;
•Extension of taxiways; and 
•Purchase of new automated vehicle parking system.

The objective of the masterplan study is to develop a technical and financial roadmap for development of four airports in Zambia (Lusaka, Ndola, Mfuwe and Livingstone). The project should not only provide recommendations for improvements and expansions needed, but also detail a phased program that is financially viable. Alternatives should be assessed and recommended to promote private sector participation. The master plan would be composed of the following elements (please note that the full Terms of Reference (TOR) and requirements for this study are located in Annex 4 of the Request for Proposal):

•A demand-capacity analysis to assess development requirements based on projected air traffic demand; 
•A development plan that identifies and prioritizes investments for the short, medium and long terms; 
•A financial plan to finance the proposed improvements and recommend concession strategies, if appropriate; and 
•An evaluation of environmental and developmental impacts associated with recommended projects. 

The project is a priority of the Government of Zambia (GOZ) for several reasons.  First, the economy is growing rapidly, particularly due to increased mining activity in the copperbelt region.  As such, increased investment in the country’s air transport infrastructure is critical to accommodate the current growth. Second, the GOZ sees tourism as a major driver for economic growth and realizes that a modern and efficient air transport infrastructure is essential to maintain and grow this industry.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $725,050 grant to the Ministry of Communications and Transport (Grantee) from USTDA.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the TOR, and a background desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to: https://www.ustda.gov/USTDA/FedBizOpps/RFP/rfpform.asp.  Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 p.m. local time on August 15, 2008 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<CONTACT>Priscilla Lee, 202-461-6807
<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs Central Office (VACO) intends to issue a sole source contract to TSI Incorporated, St. Paul, MN for the following equipment:PortaCount Pro+Respirator Fit Tester, # 8038, 65 each; and Fit Test Proble Refill Kit for 8025-N95, 65 each.  This notice of intent is not a request for quotes.  The Government intends to acquire the supplies via FAR 6.302-1 and FAR Part 12.  Interested organizations may submit descriptive literature containing sufficient literature to the extent necessary to allow the government to determine the technical acceptability of specification.  The aforementioned information should be submitted in writing to the Contract Specialist (email: Priscilla.Lee@va.gov) not later than 2:00 p.m. local time on July 7, 2008.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.    Please reference RFQ #VA-101-08-RQ-0217.  NAICS #339113.  Below is the Justification for the aforementioned supplies, in accordance with FAR 11.105:JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL FOROTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITIONUpon the basis of the following justification, I hereby approve the issuance of the contractual action described below using other than full and open competition, pursuant to the authority cited herein.1.  Identification of AgencyDepartment of Veterans AffairsOffice of Acquisition and LogisticsCenter for Acquisition Innovation (049A1)810 Vermont Avenue, NWWashington, DC  204202.  Nature of Action Being Approved:  This document sets forth the facts and requests approval for the issuance of a contract to TSI Incorporated, St. Paul, MN for TSI PortaCount direct reading fit testing units to support medical facilities within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA).  Respirator fit testing is mandated under OSHA 29 CFR 1910.134.  The proposed price is $674,129.14.3.  Description of Service and Supplies:  The TSI PortaCount is a direct reading fit testing unit for determining if a respirator or mask correctly fits the user's face and provides adequate protection from harmful particulates.  The unit streamlines the OSHA fit test protocol to a series of timed exercises (breathing, deep breathing, at rest, etc) providing a visual pass/fail score.  The unit detects leakage of the face piece mask by comparing the particle count inside and outside the mask.  This unit replaces a lengthier fit test procedure that involves subjecting the employee to a corrosive atmosphere.  This equipment is safer, faster, and the standard in the industry.  4.   Statutory Authority:  The statutory authority for this justification is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1) or 41 U.S.C. c(1) and FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.5.  Justification Rationale:  TSI is the sole source for nuclei condensation counting using ambient air particles for comparing concentrations inside and outside the mask with calculation of respiratory protection factor while the employee is wearing the actual respirator. No other company offers this technology, and it is considered the defacto method to meet the OSHA requirement. The TSI PortaCount is the only type of equipment that VAMCs have been purchasing for the past 10 years to meet OSHA quantitative fit testing requirements.  The number of staff requiring respiratory protection will greatly increase during a SARS/Pandemic flu event, thus we require additional units to ensure that our facilities will be prepared in the event of an emergency.

<CONTACT>Linda Simpson, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-427-1705, Fax 301-427-1740, Email linda.simpson@ahrq.hhs.gov
<DESC>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Contracts Management, is conducting a market survey to seek potential sources from qualified small business firms under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541611 ($5 Million), which have the capability to assist AHRQ in developing criteria for assessing the evidence base for the context-sensitive effectiveness and safety of patient safety practices (PSPs).

For purposes of this sources sought notice,  we define patient safety practices as interventions, strategies, or approaches intended to prevent or mitigate unintended consequences of the delivery of health care and to improve the safety of health care for patients.  PSPs may include clinical interventions; systems, organizational and behavioral interventions; and various combinations of these.  The effectiveness of PSPs may be affected by the nature, number, and sequencing of components; where they are implemented; with whom, for what purposes; as well as by features of the external environment as noted above.     For purposes of developing criteria for evidence review, it is important to note that the labels given to these PSPs often do not convey the full range of the PSP intervention or construct.
  
The source must be able to demonstrate the capability to:
1.   Form an interdisciplinary panel of experts in patient safety practice, frontline healthcare delivery, clinical and health services research, behavioral and social sciences, research and evaluation design and methodology, systems engineering, management science, and other disciplines as necessary.    
2.  Identify a diverse and representative set of PSPs to be used as initial subjects for helping to iteratively develop criteria for rigorous and systematic assessment of the context-sensitive effectiveness and safety of PSPs.
3.  Identify research and evaluation models, methods, and designs that could be used to rigorously evaluate the PSPs identified as part of item 2 above.   
4.  Develop a set of criteria, including criteria for strength of evidence,  to be used for assessing future studies and reports. 
5.   Identify specific needs for further development of theories, constructs, and research/evaluation designs and methods to further strengthen evaluations of PSPs and criteria for systematic review.  
6.  Provide a final summary report of the methods employed to develop the criteria, and recommendations for next steps. 

AHRQ is looking for qualified firms willing to optimize their creativity and flexibility to achieve optimum results.

Qualified firms must demonstrate substantial experience with patient safety and health quality improvement concepts and practices.  Qualified firms must have experience with assessing study quality and standardizing criteria for evidence reviews and syntheses.
Minimum qualifications include:
      •  A minimum of 5 years’ experience assessing evidence in health care delivery research.
      •  Staff experienced in assessing the roles of clinical factors, contextual factors and implementation processes in patient safety improvement implementation research and evaluation.
      •  Project leadership with an advanced degree such as a Ph.D. in social sciences and knowledge of the health care delivery system and patient safety issues, or MD with experience in organizational, engineering, management science or similar fields and knowledge of the health care delivery system and patient safety issues..
      •  Ability to attract a trans-disciplinary and diverse set of technical experts and maintain their involvement in the development of criteria for systematic evidence reviews in patient safety. 
      •  Ability to translate complex research and evaluation concepts into language accessible to potential implementers of patient safety improvement practices.
      •  Corporate experience citing a minimum of 10 relevant projects over the past 10 years.

Note: A qualified contractor does not have to have prior experience working for AHRQ, rather, a contractor must show a significant presence working in the health care industry specifically dealing with patient safety implementation research/evaluation.

Interested firms should submit their capability statement (no more than 10 pages in length) to Linda Simpson, Contract Specialist, by email at Linda.Simpson@ahrq.hhs.gov, no later than 12pm (noon) EST on July 9, 2008.  Generic capability statements will be considered non-responsive.  Capability statements must be tailored to this request and identify the source’s capabilities to complete this requirement including information on key staff experience and education, and a description of corporate experience with similar projects.

7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Mexico City, Mexico
8. JOB DESCRIPTION: See below 

GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CONTRACTOR

A. BACKGROUND: The Narcotics Affairs Section (NAS) is the office within the U.S. Embassy to Mexico that manages assistance activities funded through the State Department's Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL). In the Mexican context, NAS manages a bilateral assistance program that helps design, build and otherwise nurture the capabilities of Mexico's law enforcement agencies (LEAs), by investing in the professionalization of their personnel, the creation of their infrastructure and the provision of other needed goods and services. Future programming may support Mexican LEAs across a greatly expanded range of initiatives, in the context of the multi-year Merida Initiative (MI). 

NAS also works through the Embassy's Law Enforcement Committee to coordinate policies across the many U.S. law enforcement agencies represented at post. NAS complements the efforts of these USG LEAs by financing the travel, training and equipping of their Mexican counterparts. 

Finally, NAS finances the activities of Mexican governmental agencies and non-governmental organizations that support programs that address prevention/rehabilitation and the culture of lawfulness.

B. PURPOSE: The Policy Advisor will provide continuity to the NAS Management with respect to the process that resulted in the Merida Initiative: from the bilateral agreements reached during the original validation meetings, to the MI package’s submission to Congress, through the planning for the NAS’s administrative “right-sizing,” into the development and delivery of projects implementing the Merida Initiative and the development of support projects using regular NAS budget that provide the training and other aspects of the “tail” not otherwise provided for in the MI package as approved by Congress. This responsibility requires direct involvement (often with secretaries and sub-secretaries of Mexican Government (GOM) secretariats or their equivalents) in the design of the set of projects that constitute the Merida Initiative, the conceptual oversight to maximize the interoperability of the implemented activities across Mexican LEAs (as well as across USG LEAs) and the planning required for continuity into the future. A key part of the responsibility involves the identification of potential projects that support USG and GOM policy objectives and the championing of these projects to NAS Management. Another responsibility involves the development of means to track the status of ongoing projects and the implementation of the Initiative as a whole for NAS Management. The incumbent also proposes short-/medium-/long-range plans for the NAS, for the use of the Director, Deputy Director and Program Coordinators/Advisors.

I. STATEMENT OF WORK

A.	ESSENTIAL DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES: 

The Policy Advisor directly supports the Director and Deputy Director in ensuring the coherency of the implementation of the Merida Initiative, proposing top NAS Management the strategic direction to be implemented through projects (in conjunction with the GOM) and working to establish complementary goals across the GOM’s LEAs. The incumbent must be both visionary and pragmatic, to address the needs of the key constituents. The Policy Advisor will propose the means to integrate the projects that NAS undertakes to ensure consistency across GOM organizational lines and internationally, including with USG LEAs, as appropriate. 

Specific duties and responsibilities will include:

1.	Identify, develop and implement projects consistent with concepts negotiated under Merida Initiative and as amended by US Congress. Ensure that these projects advance USG interests and build upon investments the NAS has already made. 
2.	Establish a plan for implementing the “tail” of projects that have been initiated with MI funding into out-years, to ensure that the best value is gained from the investments made.
3.	Establish appropriate advisory and governance mechanisms to ensure productive interaction between implementers (including USG agency personnel, as well as non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and contractors) and customers (usually GOM personnel, but also including personnel from Mexican state governments and NGOs). 
4.	Build the broadest possible alliances across all interested parties (USG and GOM, state governments and civil society) to ensure USG resources are managed effectively, ensuring a competitive and efficient cost structure. 
5.	Oversee the development of staff and ensure that the NAS has a quality workforce with the technical skills and competencies needed to accomplish its greatly expanded mission.

<DESC>The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) is interested in receiving market information for software maintenance and enhancement help desk support and web hosting.  This is a request for information seeks to obtain industry concepts, capability and market information.  This RFI does not in anyway constitute a Request-For-Proposal (RFP) and as such, shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this notice, nor otherwise pay for proposal preparation costs supporting submission of a response to this RFI.  Responses to this RFI shall include the name of the organization, point-of-contact, disclosure of small business status against the above referenced NAICS code, corporate capabilities, and experience  of potential key personnel as it relates. 

SOFTWARE MAINTENANCE AND ENHANCEMENT 
HELP DESK SUPPORT AND WEB HOSTING

Overview

The DLA Office of General Counsel (DG) requires contract support for the software program entitled the Case Management System (CMS).  Specifically, DG requires hosting and maintenance of the software program on servers with access to the program via the World Wide Web (internet) and Citrix Metaframe.  The contractor shall provide Help Desk support on an as needed basis during normal working hours of 9 to 5, EST.  There is a plan in place to migrate the hosting service from the contractor site to DLA servers, currently residing on contractor servers.

Environment

The contractor currently operates the software program CMS on a Dell server accessed via the Internet using Citrix Metaframe.  All transactions between Office of General Counsel personnel users and the host server will be through standard http protocols using standard web browsers (Internet Explorer) and must not require mobile code (i.e. postscript, active-X).  Hosting of the CMS application and database (Interbase) will be migrated to DLA.  CMS maintenance releases will be provided by the contractor to DLA personnel and scheduled for implementation within the DLA infrastructure when DLA becomes the hosting facility.

Work Location and Rules

All work will be performed at the contractor’s facilities or at the HQC on Fort Belvoir.  It is expected that work at the contractor’s facilities will comprise 90% or more of the hours and work at Fort Belvoir will be 10% or fewer hours.  DLA J6 does have an ongoing initiative to transfer the hosting responsibility for CMS to the DLA HQC local area network.  DLA will provide the contractor with a computer that will be used to access the CMS application, the CMS Database server, and any other server that is deemed pertinent to the support of the CMS system on the DLA network.

The hosting facility will be responsible for ensuring adequate physical security of their servers and the Government software programs at their facility. 


Tasks

CMS must remain operational and accessible 24/7, except during the performance of maintenance that requires the system to be off-line. Once DLA assumes control of the CMS System hosting, the contractor will be limited to ensuring that anything related to CMS application system (e.g. Application Code, Database operation) remains operational. DLA will ensure access at that time and not the contractor.


Technology Overview

The contractor shall review the contract requirements and brief DG on enhancements or modifications to the software prior to initiating any enhancement or modification. 

The contractor shall: 
Implementation

&#61607;         Host CMS Software on appropriate strength servers. (This mission will transfer to DLA.)
&#61607;         Upgrade CMS Software as required to maintain its utility. These upgrades will include software version upgrades for the application and supporting components. 
&#61607;         Perform and/or coordinate with DLA, all maintenance, upgrades, troubleshooting and improvements necessary to ensure the CMS application remains fully operational, 24/7. Application requires thorough knowledge of the CMS Client/Server Windows application written in Borland/Delphi, the Interbase database platform and related administration and performance techniques, and the supporting third-party software component used with CMS for reporting and ad-hoc queries, currently using Shazam Wizard.  
&#61607;	Provide Help Desk support for all matters related to the CMS application access, installation, configuration, and operation of CMS during normal business hours of 9 to 5, EST. Help desk support requires an intimate understanding of the functional user requirements in the CMS process, technical understanding of the interactions of the multiple application screens and software components, and authorization procedures to access the application.
&#61607;	Provide technical liaison support for DLA/DG regarding DLA/Government interface partners, system technical capabilities, and provide input, where applicable, for compliance with any government directives concerning the application. 

Deliverables

Web hosting of CMS on appropriate strength servers. (This deliverable will transfer to DLA.)


Help Desk support during normal working hours. 
CMS System maintenance support (on-going).

Deliver a copy of the CMS database and access codes to DLA DG. 

Provide assistance to DLA in migration of the CMS System from contractor facility to DLA, including; all supporting software components, database files, and user authorization credentials.

Provide cost and schedule estimates for any requests from DLA Contracting Representatives for system enhancements, alterations, and changes that are outside of the scope of normal maintenance activities, when requested.

<DESC>This notice is issued by the NASA/GSFC to post a Request for Information via theinternet to seek industry comments and input regarding the availability of Medium SunSensors (MSS) for the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Core Observatory attitudecontrol system.  This document is for information and planning purposes and to allowindustry the opportunity to verify reasonableness and feasibility of the requirements, aswell as promote competition.The GPM mission is one of the next generation satellite-based Earth science constellationmissions that will study global precipitation (rain, snow and ice).  GPM Core Observatorywill be carrying both a dual frequency radar instrument and a passive microwaveradiometer. The Core Observatory will serve as a calibration standard for the othermembers of the GPM constellation. The mission life requirement of GPM is 3 years, withthe goal of 5 years.GPM is a scientific observatory, carrying instruments designed to characterize theprecipitation over the globe on a continuous basis. Scientists must control, veryprecisely, where each instrument on the observatory is pointing so that data can begeo-located for future analysis. As the instruments fields-of-view move from target totarget, knowledge of where data was taken must be accurately recorded as the observatorymoves through space.The Medium Sun Sensor may be packaged in a single housing or as multiple sensor headsaffixed to a mounting structure, where the mounting structure interfaces with thespacecraft.  The MSS will be used to determine the position of the sun in the local x-ycoordinate plane, which is the plane orthogonal to the MSS mounting surface.In order for GPM to comply with NASAs end-of-life disposal requirements in the mostefficient manner, the Core Observatory will be designed to demise (burn up or melt away)upon atmospheric re-entry to the greatest extent possible.  The debris casualty areaallocated to the MSS is 0 m2, meaning that the MSS are required to completely demiseduring re-entry.  This is not expected to be an issue with a component the size of theMSS, but it must be examined.The GPM Project is planning an acquisition strategy for two flight MSS. Some fundamentalinformation is requested from industry to assist the GPM project with the development ofan acquisition strategy for the MSS.  Through this RFI, the GPM Project wishes toidentify MSS requiring none to minimal non-recurring engineering (NRE) costs that willmeet the GPM observatory performance needs and satisfy the total demiseability guidelinesfor the GPM mission.The following are requirements for the MSS:Description	RequirementAccuracy	+/- 2 degrees (per axis, 3 sigma)Field of View (half cone angle) 17.5 degreesTolerance: +/- 2.5 degreesPower	0W(1)Temperature Range (operating)-40C to +93CMass (including all brackets and baffles)&lt;500 gSize (including all brackets and baffles)Fits within 5x5x5 inch cube1  MSS is to be a current source only with no external power required.With regard to alignment: the MSS sensors will require placement, knowledge and stabilitytolerances of +/- 0.2 degrees each. An alignment cube, with surfaces normal to less than5 arcsec, will be used for MSS alignment to the spacecraft.  It is desirable to have thealignment cube delivered as part of the MSS.  If it cannot be, the spacecraft may be ableto provide an alignment cube on the MSS mounting bracket.The GPM Project encourages all industry sources with expertise in providing sun sensorsto respond to this RFI.  The responses should demonstrate technical feasibility,operational robustness and reliability.  Sources with relevant information to this RFIare encouraged to respond by submitting a white paper that includes the followinginformation: Background and Description of Proposed Approach:  Describe in detail the specificcomponents being proposed for GPM Projects consideration.  Describe the current state ofdevelopment, past use, types of interfaces, and expected performance.  Please address anymodifications to existing designs necessary to meet the GPM requirements, and describethe qualification approach to ensure success.Component specification: Provide the component specification and the requestedperformance data. These topics should either be addressed in a white paper or submittedas a separate document.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT MS VIRGINIA (GINNY) SLAYTON @ 706-787-2019 OR virginia.slayton@us.army.mil OR Mike Tierney, (706) 787-2093, michael.tierney1@us.army.mil  65-Medical Supplies-Potential Sources Sought<BR><BR>A.	General Information.  <BR><BR>     The Southeast Region (TRBO Reg. 3 & 4), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 46 Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the states of Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, and affiliated MTFs in countries of Puerto Rico, Honduras, and Cuba announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Incontinence Products Pediatric Diapers. <BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.<BR><BR>The major facilities in the Southeast Region include, but are not limited to Eisenhower Army Medical Center (FT Gordon, GA), Winn Army Community Hospital (FT Stewart, GA), Martin Army Community Hospital (FT Benning, GA), Naval Hospital Jacksonville (NAS Jacksonville, FL), 96th Medical Group (Eglin AFB, FL), Naval Hospital Pensacola (Pensacola, FL), Naval Hospital Beaufort (Beaufort, SC), 81st Medical Group (Keesler AFB, MS) and the 6th Medical Group (MacDill AFB, FL).  <BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products. This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.<BR><BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two year(s) (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years.)  Anticipated selection date is October 2008.  The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors.  Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important. The selection will be determined utilizing Best value/ trade-off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  A multiple vendor RIA selection may provide the best-value, lowest overall cost alternative if: 1) The requirements of the Region for Incontinence Products-Pediatric Diapers product line can be met in the most clinically effective manner by more than one vendor, and 2) The requirements of the Region for Incontinence Products-Pediatric Diapers product line can be met with the lowest overall cost, by more than one vendor.   <BR>Point of Contact:  Mike Tierney, (706) 787-2093, michael.tierney1@us.army.mil, or Ginny Slayton, (706) 787-2019, Virginia.slayton@us.army.mil.   <BR><BR>B.	Products & Performance Required.  <BR><BR>The Southeast Region is seeking product line items in the category of Incontinence Products-Pediatric Diapers, which at a minimum includes the high volume lines below.  Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $17,417.96.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  The top high volume usage lines for this project are shown in the Technical/Company Criteria below.<BR><BR>At the request of the Southeast Regional MTFs, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing during implementation, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors.  <BR><BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their detailed responses to the technical/company criteria and (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to the enclosed POC.   Submissions must be received by 5:00 PM EDT on the specified closing date/time of this sources sought notice.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating in the standardization process.  <BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes.  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its initial submission, quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00PM EDT on the date listed for closing (per the FBO RFQ), will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative.  All email communications between vendors and the Region should be digitally signed by the issuer.<BR><BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria.  <BR><BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Southeast Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  <BR><BR>The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  Vendors are to provide quote on discounts, in response to this RFQ.  <BR><BR>Phase I  Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their detailed responses and required documentation to the POC by the required response date.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  a.) In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: (1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line of products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (2) the vendors information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. <BR>NOTE: Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional, more-specific definition of technical acceptability.  The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.<BR><BR>The following equally weighted Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:<BR>1.	Vendor MUST provide a complete line of Incontinence Products  Pediatric Diapers.  A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. <BR>a.

Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the TRBO, on behalf of the CPT, will request product sample sets from the product group to be sent to select MTFs for evaluation.  Vendors are required to ship their samples directly to the designated MTFs and will be allowed 14 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery.  Samples and literature must be shipped to arrive at the MTF by COB, 5:00 PM EDT, on the (14th) calendar day after the notice to ship.  Vendors failing to deliver the literature and product sample sets by the deadline will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.  NOTE: all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the quantity, products, description of items, and date of shipment from the vendor, anticipated delivery date and individual who signed for literature and product sample sets.  Specific MTFs will evaluate the vendors product sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a clinical (patient care) setting using a Likert scale, with a one to five rating.  The scale descriptors are: one (1)-not acceptable, two (2)-minimally acceptable, three (3)-acceptable, four (4)-more acceptable and five (5)-highly acceptable.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.  The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for 30 calendar days.  The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.0 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative -- at or near 3.0 -- depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.0, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and will be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  <BR>To determine acceptability, a Clinical Product Team (CPT) comprised of medical professionals from multiple disciplines will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below.  <BR><BR>The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative:  Vendor products meet the Clinical Acceptability Target Threshold:  3.0.<BR>1.	(Patient Safety) Diapers backing protects linen from wetness. <BR>a.   The products ability to protect linen from wetness will also protect patient from   <BR>      contact with skin irritation from bodily fluids.<BR>            b.   This criterion will be evaluated by 10 trials in a clinical (patient care) setting. <BR>c.   Clinician will inspect patients linen for signs of wetness during diaper use.<BR>2.  (Patient Safety) Pediatric Diaper draws wetness away from patients skin. <BR>a.   Drawing wetness away from patients skin will help prevent skin breakdown/damage due to contact with skin irritant (i.e. bodily fluids).<BR>            b.   This criterion will be evaluated by 10 trials in a clinical (patient care) setting.<BR>c.   During patient assessments clinician will inspect whether patients skin remains dry while when diaper is damp.<BR>3.   (Patient Safety) Re-sealable closure tabs remain adhesive after multiple uses. <BR>a.   Re-sealable closure tabs allow for multiple opening and closing episodes to facilitate  <BR>      frequent skin assessments without altering diapers proper position.<BR>            b.   This criterion will be evaluated by 10 trials in a clinical (patient care) setting.<BR>c.   Clinician will pull sealed tab, on side of diaper, open& inspect patients skin <BR>      condition and then close and reseal the adhesive closure tab.  The clinician will visually and manually assess that closure tabs remain adhesive after multiple opening and closure procedures.<BR>4.    (Patient Safety) Diaper does not tear or fall apart during use. <BR>            a.   An intact diaper protects patient from skin irritation caused by bodily fluids.<BR>            b.   This criterion will be evaluated by 10 trials in a clinical (patient care) setting.<BR>c.   Clinician will visibly observe whether diaper tears or falls apart during use (ex: patient repositioning self or clinicians repositioning patient).<BR>5.    (Patient Safety) Diapers elastic waist and leg bands provide a tailored non-leak fit.<BR>a.    Elastic waist and leg bands that adapt to various widths provide a comfortable fit while helping prevent wetness to linen and other body parts thus eliminating skin irritation.<BR>	b.    This criterion will be evaluated by 10 trials in a clinical (patient care) setting.<BR>c.    Clinician will manually stretch waist and leg bands and visually observe that bands return to original position (evaluating elastic memory).  While patient is wearing diaper, clinician will visually observe that leg and waist bands remain snug to patient thus providing a non- leak condition. <BR>	<BR>Phase III  Pricing Analysis Process.  After the clinical/performance evaluation is completed and analyzed, all vendors in the clinical evaluation group who met the minimum clinical acceptability target threshold (-- at or near 3.0 -- depending on the location of any break in vendors average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors average scores) as determined by the CPT, will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes (as well as product cross-reference data) based on committed volume of 80% of the total Regional requirement.  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.0, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and will be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  Vendors will be provided 14 calendar days to submit their price quotes in a prescribed format via email.  Price quotes must be received by 5:00 PM EST on the 14th calendar day.  Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified from further consideration/ participation.  (Note: vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified.  Note: Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.)  The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions as noted above.<BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two year (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region.  (Post-Standardization Costs).  This represents the new estimated annual cost or the total cost post standardization and includes the vendors products, and the products that could not be matched.  It reflects the amount the Region would pay the vendor using the RIA pricing.  (2) Potential Cost Avoidance.  Cost avoidance is calculated by subtracting the RIA price from the Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) price and multiplying by 12-months of usage.  This is included as a reporting Matrix.  (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines.  The unmatched lines make it difficult to compare the prices of the various vendors, because the evaluator cannot compare similar product lines for each vendor.  Those items that are considered in the high usage category will have a higher impact to the region for the unmatched product line and the end post-standardization costs. (4) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor.  The Region intends to reduce the number of SKUs that must be handled per period.  Vendors that can supply the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, will be more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative. THE CLOSING DATE IS 21 JULY 2008 5:00 PM EDT<BR><BR>

<DESC>Contracting Office Address: Department of the Treasury, Bureau of the Public Debt (BPD), Division of Procurement, 200 Third Street, Avery 5F, Parkersburg WV, 26101.

Description: National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign Evaluation and Recommendations

The Bureau of Public Debt, on behalf of the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), seeks comments and recommendations regarding a strategy for evaluating the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign (the Campaign). Commentators are prohibited from communicating with ONDCP regarding this request for comments. Discussions with ONDCP may jeopardize any proposal submitted by or on behalf of your organization in response to future related solicitations. Interested parties are advised not to submit proposals in response to this RFI. The Government intends to release a request for proposals for the study in the fourth quarter of Fiscal Year 2008.

The ONDCP Reauthorization of 2006, Public Law 109-469, Section 709 requires the Campaign to be evaluated in two ways. The “Testing and Evaluation of Advertising” is not part of this requirement. The second requirement is for evaluation of the overall effectiveness of the Campaign. The Campaign is to be evaluated in a manner that enables consideration of whether the national media campaign has contributed to reduction of illicit drug use among youth. The effectiveness of the national media campaign shall be evaluated based on data from—

1.	The Monitoring the Future Study published by the Department of Health and Human Services;
2.	The Attitude Tracking Study published by the Partnership for a Drug-Free America (PATS); and
3.	The National Survey on Drug Abuse and Health (formerly National Household Survey on Drug Abuse).
4.	Data from other relevant studies or publications, including tracking and evaluation data collected according to marketing and advertising industry standards, may be included if approved by the COTR.

The Campaign has not had an overall evaluation since 2004.

Many challenges are expected in evaluating the Campaign. These include:
1.	The Campaign was launched before there was opportunity for a baseline measure and because this is a national campaign designed to reach youth and parents nationwide, no control group is feasible.
2.	Other influences on youth drug-using behaviors, such as school-based drug education programs, community drug prevention efforts, the pro-drug movement and pro-drug influences on teens’ social and technological environment are difficult to measure, much less to control, therefore attribution of changes in behavior over time are difficult to attribute to the Campaign or to any other single strategy.
3.	Although existing cross-sectional surveys are of value in tracking changes in youth knowledge, attitudes and behaviors, including expose to anti-drug messages over time, they do not include measures specific to this Campaign so they cannot be used to attribute attitudinal or behavioral changes to the Campaign. 
4.	As the annual appropriations for the Campaign have declined dramatically, the resources necessary to field a large-scale evaluation are rapidly diminishing. 
5.	The required methamphetamine campaign essentially adds a third target audience – youth adults – thus adding further complications to a comprehensive evaluation.
6.	Measure of media exposure is increasingly complex. Self-reported exposure to anti-drug messages is known to be unreliable, especially because teens most interested in drugs are more likely to be attentive to both pro and anti-drug messages, and today’s media world is increasingly fragmented with dynamic shifts in use of the TV and the internet, with much simultaneous exposure (multi-tasking) occurring, especially among youth.

In developing its strategy, the government would like comments on the following questions:
(1)	How can existing formative and process evaluation procedures be improved and possibly used to strengthen the overall evaluation?  Are these the best formative and process evaluation procedures? Are there new procedures from either industry or academia that could improve the evaluation?  
(2)	What improvement and/or expansion of the PATS should be considered for outcome evaluation purposes?
(3)	What are the best methods to measure actual advertising exposure, given apparent problems with self-reported media exposure?
(4)	What are the strengths and limitations of survey methods that rely on the Internet or other newer technologies? Are such methods appropriate evaluation tools for this campaign?
(5)	Given the congressional requirement that the campaign address methamphetamine use (which has declined rapidly among youth in recent years and is largely a regional problem), as well as the core target audiences of youth and parents, what should be the priority for evaluation, given limitations of funds? 
(6)	What factors outside the campaign's control, such as exposure to other anti- and (especially) pro-drug messaging through the media (including internet, social networking sites and music) should be monitored?  And if they should be monitored, what are the best methods?
(7)	What effects size over what timeframe should be expected from a campaign of this size and scope?  What impact does that have on key issues such as sample size and statistical power and therefore on costs?  
(8)	What safeguards against unintentional (undesirable) normative (counterproductive) effects should be included in evaluation design? What other theoretical "boomerang" results should be monitored (e.g., reactance)? How? 
(9)	How should campaign success be defined?  Should a sub-population of youth (e.g., high sensation seekers) be the target audience rather than all youth?  Should youth be segmented by drug use intention status (e.g., committed users, committed non-users and non-committed youth) rather than by other variables?  If so, should the evaluation instrument be able to capture such segments as well as the youth population as a whole?  If so, what are implications for design, sampling and costs?
(10)	Should the underlying theory of the campaign, Theory of Reasoned Action, be reviewed or reconsidered?  What competing theories are worthy of consideration as a basis for campaign operations and evaluations?
(11)	What additional recent literature should be reviewed? 
(12)	Would your firm be interested in pursing a contract to provide the evaluation as described above?
(13)	Do you currently perform similar evaluation services for federal agencies and/or national campaigns? If so, please provide contract information.
(14)	Do you have suggestions concerning the language of the required services to improve clarity, streamline proposal preparation and promote interest from vendors in this acquisition approach?

A website has been established to provide materials pertinent to this requirement, including future requests for proposals.  To request a password, complete the form found at http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/utilities/contact_rfc.html
  	A logon id and password will be emailed to you.

<DESC>6/25/08 - Second Group of QuestionsQuestions and AnswersSolicitation Number VA-259-08-RP-0146Havre CBOCPrior questions and answers were numbered 1-43 and posted on 6/24/08Question 44:  Will contractor be authorized to schedule Enrollment Exams for VA beneficiaries who call and request enrollment at the CBOC?Answer 44:  In other Contact Clinics, the VA clerk works closely with contractor to coordinate scheduling of patients and they are scheduled into the VA scheduling database (if contractor wants to have own scheduling system that may be justifiable). Performance Standards listed in the contract state that all new veterans must be seen within 30days of their enrollment.Question 45:  Can contractor conduct marketing efforts to increase enrollment?Questions 45:  I am not aware of any restrictions on conducting marketing to increase enrollment.  Question 46:  Of the 4,325 veterans in the area, how many are currently enrolled?Answer 46:  Out of the 4,325 (from solicitation) that are veterans in the catchment area, approximately 1300 was the number of enrollees on or around January 1, 2007.   Question 47:  What will be the number of enrollees to the Havre CBOC on the first day of services?Answer 47:  We have no way of knowing what veterans may CHOOSE to use the Havre CBOC, remain at other VA clinics or stay with private provider.Question 48:  Considering the contract base year will be less than an eight week period, is it realistic to estimate a growth of 167 additional enrollees by October 1, 2008?Answer 48:  As stated before, the numbers are estimates and projected numbers.  Question 49:  Will the VA assign/enroll any current enrollees to Havre CBOC?Answer 49:  No, they will not automatically be moved over to the Havre CBOC. Veterans will be enrolled to the Havre CBOC at their request. Enrolled veteran will get a letter announcing the opening of the new clinic and will be given the VA clerk's (in Havre) phone number to call if they want to get care at this clinicQuestion 50:  Pages 10 to 19 in the solicitation identified encounters/visits from 1/1/07 to 6/4/08.  What was the population base used to obtain these encounters/visits?  How much of the population base was enrolled?Answer 50:  The total unique users for the last three FY's are 1,302.  The total veteran population for FY 2005 was 4,325.53.  The total three year market penetration (total users/total vp) was 30.09%.    Question 51:  Please clarify how the VA will pay the contractor.  Will the Government pay contractor a price per enrollee per month for all enrollees who have been treated in the past 12 months or yearly payment for each new annual visit/enrollment or a combination of the two?  Answer 51:  Invoices are submitted to the COTR monthly for the capitated rate of the number of veterans enrolled plus payment for any new enrollees. Question 52:  The wording of the NOTE on page 7 leads one to believe that each option year starts with zero enrollees.  Is this correct?Answer 52:  For each contract option year the enrolled patient must receive a minimum of one office visit before receiving payment for the option year.  Once the patient is enrolled, they will not re-enroll with the exception of the disenrollment (not seen by contractor provided for 2 years).  In other words, they all carry over in the next year unless they are disenrolled because they have not been seen within the two year period.    Question 53:  Will all radiology films be read by the contractor's radiologist?Answer 53:  YesQuestion 54:  Of the 4,325 veterans in the area, how many are female?Answer 54:  We do not have that data, statewide the percentage is 3.9%Question 55:  If the VA is projecting an estimated enrollment growth rate of 167 enrollees per year, why would not the schedules on pages 6 and 7 reflect the estimated number of Enrollment Exams to be 167 rather than just 10?     Answer 55:   The exam numbers are estimates and the growth rate is a projection.  We do not have the exact numbers.

<DESC>It is the intent of this agency to award a sole source purchase order using the acquisition procedures for commercial item (FAR Parts 12 & under the authority of the test program for commercial items (FAR 13.5); section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 for the rental of Audio-Visual Equipment and Support from the Host Marriott Hotel, the location selected for IRS Employee Training, July 15-17 & July 29-31, 2008.  Estimated value of this action is $162,000.00 or less.

Background:  The Internal Revenue Service / Human Capital 2008 Continuing Professional Education (CPE) is being held in New Orleans, Louisiana on July 15 – 17 and July 29 – 31, 2008.   The decision to hold this CPE in New Orleans on the specified dates was based on an analysis of the overall cost to the Government, including travel, room rates and per-diem, and all related expenses estimated at $3,330.000.

A nation-wide market survey was initiated by the Internal Revenue Service by utilizing a National Hotel Broker Service to solicit the interest of hotels capable of providing accommodation and classroom space for 2,200 attendees (two sessions of approx. 1,100 each; three day sessions).  New Orleans was chosen as the geographic location, based on the best overall value to the Government based on all factors, including the non-procurement factors such as travel and per-diem costs specific to the IRS employees attending these two CPE sessions. 

A survey of Hotels in New Orleans resulted in a single acceptable source, The Host Marriott Hotel, 555 Canal Street, New Orleans, LA 70130.

Notice of Intent to award on a sole-source basis:
IRS intends to award to the Host Marriott Hotel on a sole source basis Audio-Visual services required to support this CPE, including in-house rental of Internet Access and related Telecommunications, Audio-Visual Equipment set-up and rental, Audio- Visual Engineering Services including Camera and Audio Support for General Sessions and up to 35 break-out rooms per day.  Final configurations (number of break-out rooms required per day) are yet to be completed, therefore the cost is yet to be determined, but is estimated $100,000.00, however is not anticipated to exceed $162,000.00.

 A determination by the Government to not compete this purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received from interested parties will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.5. There is no solicitation available for this requirement. This requirement will be awarded through the Simplified Acquisition Procedures under FAR Part 13. The award will be made on July 9, 2008. Questions concerning this procurement may be addressed to Jim Gensler, Procurement Analyst by email: jim.gensler@irs.gov.

Participation by non-U.S.organizations is welcome but subject to NASAs policy of no exchange of funds, in whicheach government supports its own national participants and associated costs.The objectives of the ACT Program are to research, develop, and demonstrate component-and subsystem-level technology developments that: Reduce the risk, cost, size, volume, mass, and development time of Earth observinginstruments and platforms, and Enable new Earth observation measurements.The ACT segment of the overall Earth Science Technology Office (ESTO) program advancescore component technologies to a technology readiness level (TRL) that enables them tograduate to other programs, such as the Instrument Incubator Program, or to directlyinfuse them into a mission.This opportunity focuses on advancing the components and subsystem technologies that arenecessary to implement the measurements described in the National Research Council's(NRC) Decadal Survey (Reference: Earth Science and Applications from Space: NationalImperatives for the Next Decade and Beyond, ISBN: 0-309-66900-6 (2007) or access a freepdf download from http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11820.html  ). Measurements called for inthe Decadal Survey have been assembled into fourteen (14) mission concepts with startdates ranging from 2010 to 2020 for implementation by NASA. The ASCENDS mission, as described in the NRC Decadal Survey, requires simultaneous laserremote sensing of CO2 and O2 in order to convert CO2 atmospheric concentrations to mixingratios. The CO2 mixing ratio needs to be measured to a precision of &gt; or = to 0.5percent of background (slightly less than 2 ppm) at 100-km horizontal length scale overland and at 200-km scale over open oceans. LaRC is seeking potential partner(s) with thepotential for making significant contributions to enhancing the technology readiness ofthe ASCENDS measurements recommended by the Decadal Survey.

Measurements called for inthe Decadal Survey have been assembled into fourteen (14) mission concepts with startdates ranging from 2010 to 2020 for implementation by NASA. The Global Atmospheric Composition Mission (GACM) mission, as described in the NRCDecadal Survey, requires transformational improvements in the understanding ofchemical-weather processes on regional to global scales and to make a revolutionaryimprovement in the ability to model and forecast global atmospheric chemistry, airpollution, and surface UV radiation. Achieving those objectives requires measurement ofthe global distribution of tropospheric O3 at sufficient vertical resolution tounderstand tropospheric chemistry and dynamic processes in tropical, mid-latitude, andhigh-latitude regions and the measurement of key trace gases (CO, NO2, CH2O, and SO2) andaerosols that either are related to photochemical production of O3 or can be used astracers of tropospheric pollution and dynamics. The objectives of GACM require a uniquecombination of passive and active remote sensing instruments in low Earth orbit (LEO).Passive nadir measurements of CO, O3, NO2, SO2, CH2O, and aerosols can be made globallyfrom a Sun-synchronous orbit, which is the implementation recommended here. To achievethe desired high-vertical-resolution O3 measurements to better than 2 km across themiddle to lower troposphere with concurrent profiles of aerosols and atmosphericstructure to better than 150 m, an active system operating in a polar LEO is required.The measurements can be made with a differential-absorption lidar (DIAL) system operatingin the UV (305320 nm) for O3 and in the visible (500650 nm) for aerosols. LaRC isseeking potential partner(s) with the potential for making significant contributions toenhancing the technology readiness of the GACM measurements recommended by the DecadalSurvey.  In particular, NASA LaRC is seeking potential partners with capabilities in the followingtechnical areas:1)	Space-qualifiable UV laser transmitter components and subsystems, including butnot limited to second harmonic generator, seed laser, optical parametric amplifier,optical parametric oscillator, and sum frequency generator technologies, meeting the GACMrequirements;2)	Technologies and components with the potential of reducing the power-apertureproduct required for GACM measurements;3)	Supporting technologies including, but not limited to, cavity locking schemes,drive electronics, energy efficient compact packaging designs coupled with optimizedcooling technologies, and high speed digitizing electronics.Teaming with providers of and leveraging emerging technologies, such as current andrecent Small Business Innovative Research awards(http://sbir.gsfc.nasa.gov/SBIR/awards.htm  ), is of special interest.If selected through this synopsis, it is expected that selected partner(s) will work withNASA LaRC scientists and engineers to jointly develop the proposal.

FBO is the primary point of entry to be used when access to synopses and solicitations from the World Wide Web is required.  However, the NECO webpage as well as the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Acquisition webpage serve as alternatives if the FBO website is unavailable. Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane Division plans to modify the existing firm-fixed price contract with Aeroflex Cupertino, 10411 Bubb Rd, Cupertino CA 95014 for additional signal generator hardware and software.   The contract was awarded to Aeroflex Cupertino, 10411 Bubb Road, Cupertino CA 95014 using other than full and open competition and the procedures at FAR 13.5.  Delivery will be FOB Destination, NSWC-Crane, Crane IN 47522-5000, within 120 days ARO.  The proposed contract action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, Aeroflex Cupertino, under the authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. The basis for restricting competition is the proprietary information of Aeroflex Cupertino, form, fit, and function compatibility and the duplicative cost to the Government to utilize another source to satisfy the Governments requirements.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, San Diego (SSC-SD) code 532, insupport of Joint Forces Command (USJFCOM) requires a software architecture thatcan bring network management to the Deputy Secretary of Defense charteredInformation Operations Range and VisIOn initiatives. (See attached Draft SOW).Circadence, Inc, (4888 Pearl East Circle, Suite 101 Boulder, Colorado 80301) asmall business, is presently supporting the Government in this area. Circadencehas developed the WARP appliances which, when applied to a networkinfrastructure, increases the throughput capability without having to increasebandwidth.   The USJFCOM engineering staff recently conducted an analysis ofWARP technology.  Initial efforts involved analysis of data from WARPtechnology currently in use by the Marine Corp, Army, and the commercialsector.  Based on favorable results, the Government purchased an initial set ofthe WARP appliances through a Northrop Grumman prime contract, under whichCircadence was a subcontractor.  WARP performance testing indicated asignificant improvement in speed and accuracy. When WARP was applied to largedata files traversing the range network, average gains of 200%-350% in networkperformance were achieved.  No other technical alternatives were identifiedcapable of producing similar results without impacting the design andreliability of current systems. These capabilities, combined with the abilityof WARP to be integrated into other applications, are believed to be unique andnot readily available in other commercially available alternatives. Previousmarket surveys conducted by the US Army, US Marine Corps as well as independentcommercial evaluations support the findings from IO Range testing and researchconfirm the belief that the Circadence WARP platform provides industry uniquecapabilities in performance, portability, and usability.
For these reasons, the Government intends to award a sole source fixed pricecompletion contract to Circadence for this effort. The contract Period ofPerformance is estimated at 24 months (12 month base period, with a 12 monthoption). The estimated value of the effort is $8.95 Million. NAICS Code 541512.Note 22 Applies.

<DESC>The USDA, Agricultural Research Service (ARS), Eastern Regional Research Center (ERRC), Microbial Food Safety (MFS), intends to negotiate solely with Koch Equipment LLC, in Kansas City, MO to purchase one each of 1)  Koch/Gunther Injectamatic Part No. 333125-Model PI-21 Automatic Pickle Injector (injects bone-in or boneless product), the equipment includes twenty-one spring–loaded stainless steel needles for bone-in or boneless product; Needle head operates at 42 strokes per minute, 4mm diameter needles standard 3.0mm available for fish, bacon or poultry applications; Variable pump percentages.  Handy control adjusts pump pressure to desired level  (0 to 45 p.s.i.) (minimum level approximately 8%); Consistent pump percentages from batch-to-batch using a triple filter system consisting of canister, screen and bag-type filters to keep needles clear; Easily removable 280mm (11 in)  wide, high-impact, interlocking polyethylene conveyor with intermittent movement in conjunction with needle head operation; USDA acceptance with easy cleaning and maintenance features; 8.6-in maximum product clearance.   Dimensions:  58-in. long x 22-in. wide x 76-in high  Electrical:  230 volt, 60 Hertz, 3 phase (9.6 amps); 2)  Steaker Knife Tenderizer Part No. 333218;  3)  Deluxe stainless steel positive displacement pump Part No 333135; 4)  Stainless steel brine truck w/ drain and plug Part No. 014988;  5)  Product  “Short-Stop” Inserts Into Injector Part No. 330006.  This equipment is needed to deliver enough injection and brine solution per unit of meat to perform experiments to determine the transfer of food borne pathogens into beef subprimals and their subsequent dispersion throughout the meat as the brine is injected.  This study will be vital in providing data for a collaborative risk assessment that we will be conducting with the USDA-Food Safety and Inspection Service to determine the hazards that consumers would face if they ate steaks cut from these subprimals.  Koch Equipment is the sole manufacturer of a pilot-scale size needle injector that is large enough and fast enough (42 strokes per minute) to deliver enough injection and brine solution per unit of meat to perform experiments to determine the transfer of food borne pathogens into beef subprimals.  Companies with the demonstrated capabilities of providing this instrument must submit a descriptive statement, including descriptive literature, specifically addressing the equipment’s components and availability.  The NAICS is 333993.  The statement and literature must be submitted to the Contracting Office Address within 10 days of publication of this notice.  This is not a request for proposal.  NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE.

The relevant NAICS code is 541310 (Architectural Services).Interested offerors are invited to submit complete qualification packets (SF 330) on or before July 16, 2008 to the following address:Jason V. White, Contract SpecialistSamuel S. Stratton VA Medical Center113 Holland Ave., Room C67Albany, NY 12208Electronic submissions will also be accepted at Jason.White@va.gov.  Electronic submissions should reference the RFP number in the subject line of the email.  Telephone inquiries will not be accepted.Offerors will be evaluated primarily based on the interior design experience/ability evident in the proposed team, supplied past performance, and educational/professional qualifications submitted.  Other areas of expertise may be considered, but will carry significantly less weight.  As such, submitted qualification packets should focus on this specific skill set in both qualification information and past performance examples.  Supplemental photographs, sketches, layouts, or other visual aids that enhance the past performance examples given in the SF 330 will be considered.The VA will evaluate submitted proposals by forming an evaluation team following shortened selection procedures as described in FAR part 36 and the associated sections of the VAAR.  In-person interviews/oral presentations are not anticipated, as the overall cost of this design is expected to fall below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold.  Submission of pricing proposals and negotiations will be held with the highest-rated offeror after evaluations take place, and as such THIS POSTING IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND NO RFP IS AVAILABLE FOR DISTRIBUTION.  The VA reserves the right to consider qualification packages already on file from prior projects this fiscal year alongside those received in direct response to this solicitation.  Firms with qualification packages already on file may submit responses to this posting highlighting specific interior design experience, but are not required to.

<DESC><p>The purpose of this effort is to establish agreements in accordance with FAR 16.7 to ensure the United States Department of State&rsquo;s Foreign Service Institute (FSI)  establishes and maintains qualified alternative sources available for FSI training, seminars, instruction etc for the following topic areas:
&bull;	Job Counselors for Retiring and Transitioning employees
	
The agreements solicited are for commercial services or items and is open to all vendors who are registered to do business with the federal government.  This is not a small business set aside as total awards are expected to exceed $100,000 over the life of the agreement.
FSI has unique requirements for contractor support and this is a CONTINUOUS solicitation but has defined proposal submission cut off dates.  Approximately every 6 months, FSI will reopen this solicitation and establish a new proposal due date.  Vendors are encouraged to submit proposals outlining the criteria listed in this solicitation. Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation factors in section M, and subsequent awards will be made as necessary. It is in the best interest of the government for the prospective respondent vendors to have an understanding of the FSI mission in regards to the need for flexibility and availability of vendor support.  
The current period for proposal submission is from June 25, 2008 through July 16, 2008 at 1:00 PM Eastern.
FSI provides training and professional development to personnel of the Department of State, the Foreign Service community and other government agencies.   FSI trains Foreign Service Officers (FSO) from all diplomatic posts throughout the world.   Students attend training and classes at FSI which are scheduled and have little, to no room for adjustment.  Students arrive and must be trained during the scheduled times as they must return to post.  Therefore, FSI must ensure trainers, presenters, instructors, etc are available when needed.  Instances occur when a government employee or a contracted vendor is not available to instruct and FSI must find a replacement, as cancelling a course for t his reason is not cost effective for the government.</p>

Description: 

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in
accordance with the format in FAR Parts 12 and 13.

             This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, quotes are being
requested and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  The North
American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 334514.  This is a small
business set-aside.  THIS REQUIREMENT IS RESTRICTED AND ONLY
SMALL BUSINESS CONTRACTORS MAY SUBMIT A QUOTE.

The NIST Chemical Science and Technology Laboratory has a requirement
for packaging dietary supplements.  These dietary supplements shall be
packaged in polyethylene heat-sealed bags inside heat-sealed Mylar 
pouches in accordance with the following Performance Work Statement
(PWS):


--BEGINNING OF THE PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT---------

                          PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT

                          Packaging of SRMs 3291 Bilberry Extract, 
                         3269 Kudzu-Containing Solid Oral Dosage Form, 
3273 Red Clover-Containing Solid Oral Dosage Form, and 
                      3298 Black Cohosh-Containing Solid Oral Dosage Form

1.  Background Information

NIST is working with the National Institutes of Health’s Office and Dietary Supplements and the Food and Drug Administration to produce a series of Standard Reference Materials (SRMs) for dietary supplements.  Suites of bilberry, kudzu, red clover, and black cohosh materials are part of this series, and this Statement of Work describes the requirements for packaging four of these materials:  SRMs 3291 Bilberry Extract, 3269 Kudzu-Containing Solid Oral Dosage Form, 3273 Red Clover-Containing Solid Oral Dosage Form, and 3298 Black Cohosh-Containing Solid Oral Dosage Form.  These materials shall be packaged in polyethylene heat-sealed bags inside heat-sealed Mylar pouches.

 




2.  Scope of Work:

The contractor will package approximately:

6300 g bilberry extract
2400 g kudzu-containing solid oral dosage form
1600 g red clover-containing solid oral dosage form
2400 g black cohosh-containing solid oral dosage form

that shall be provided by NIST.  Several containers containing kudzu, red clover, and black cohosh products will be provided.  These materials shall be individually blended – i.e., a separate blend of kudzu-containing products, a separate blend of clover-containing products, and a separate blend of black cohosh-containing products – and 2.6 g + 0.1 g aliquots shall be packaged in 4 mil polyethylene bags under dry nitrogen or argon.  This polyethylene package shall then be overpackaged in an aluminized packet with a suitable quantity of silica gel (e.g., two packets of SORB-IT).  A single container of bilberry extract shall be provided.  This material shall be blended and 1.1 g + 0.1 g aliquots shall be packaged as described above.  NIST expects to receive nominally 6300 packets of the bilberry extract, 2400 packets of the kudzu-containing material, 1600 packets of the clover-containing material, and 2400 packets of the black cohosh-containing material.


3. Specific Tasks:

Prior to packaging of these materials, the contractor shall individually blend the materials provided by NIST.  Nominally 6300 packets of the bilberry extract, 2400 packets of the kudzu-containing material, 1600 packets of the clover-containing material, and 2400 packets of the black cohosh-containing material will be prepared.  The contractor shall acquire aluminized plastic packaging material (GP-48M/25 or equivalent), 4 mil polyethylene, and silica gel packets.  Polyethylene packets shall be flushed with dry nitrogen or argon and filled with 1.1 g of bilberry extract or 2.6 g of each of the three other materials (kudzu, clover, black cohosh) with an accuracy of 0.1 g.  Packets shall be filled under controlled temperature and humidity conditions (e.g., glove box, controlled-humidity room) at 20 &#730;C to 25 &#730;C and 45% to 50% relative humidity, respectively.  Packets shall be transferred, in fill order, to a box that shall be filled from back to front.  

The back and front of each box shall be marked, and boxes shall be numbered sequentially.  Boxes shall be labeled to indicate their contents:  SRM 3291 Bilberry Extract, SRM 3269 Kudzu-Containing Solid Oral Dosage Form, SRM 3273 Red Clover-Containing Solid Oral Dosage Form, and SRM 3298 Black Cohosh-Containing Solid Oral Dosage Form.  Boxes shall be placed on pallets and delivered to NIST at the contractor’s expense.





4. Reporting Requirements and Deliverables:

Delivery of packaged material shall be expected 4 months from delivery of bulk materials to the contractor by NIST.  Delivery of material in one to four shipments shall be acceptable.

5. Government Responsibilities

NIST shall provide the contractor with bulk bilberry, kudzu, red clover, and black cohosh materials to be packaged

If fewer than 6300, 2400, 1600, and 2400 packets of the bilberry, kudzu, clover, and black cohosh materials, respectively, are received, NIST will pay only for the number of packets received.  This order shall not allow for overages.

6. Program Management and Control Requirements:

The contractor shall confirm throughout the packaging process that packets are appropriately filled and sealed and that boxes are appropriately labeled.  The contractor shall notify NIST if problems are encountered.

7. Inspection and Acceptance Criteria:

NIST shall inspect the shipment of materials to confirm that materials have been packaged as described above.  

NIST personnel shall inspect the shipment of materials.  Acceptance of the materials shall be judged on the following:  

1.  Materials shall be packaged as described in the Performance Work Statement 
    (PWS) and meet all specifications set forth in the Statement of Work.
2. All packets shall arrive intact and usable.

 8. Period of Performance: The period of Performance will begin with the receipt
     of the materials by the Contractor from NIST and run four months.

<DESC>Description:

The Department of Health and Human Services’ (DHHS) Indian Health Service (IHS), Division of Nursing, intends to negotiate with Medcom, Inc. on a sole sources basis, to provide IHS nursing staff with a broad range of online continuing education including courses developed by Medcom specifically for IHS.  The basis for restricting competition is the authority of FAR 13.106(b) that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available.  The anticipated contract period will be for one year.

The contractor shall provide IHS nursing staff with training courses via the internet by offering courses on a 24 hour a day 7 day a week basis.  

The Government believes Medcom, Inc. is the only source available to meet its needs because no other commercial source has a product that can cover the broad spectrum of training courses needed along with the ability to add and update the PHN courses within the context of the other limitations in a single solution .  Additionally, no other service is known that has the ability to offer the courses needed, except for the PHN courses, immediately which includes courses developed specifically for IHS and a training tool that IHS staff is already trained and familiar with.  IHS requires the product to have the list of abilities that follows.

The ability to pay for a broad array of courses via a user license.
The ability to provide needed data extracts on a regular basis in a useable electronic format.
Content shall be accessible 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
Ability to distribute courseware via the Internet.
Courses of various clinical subjects will train, test, and track continuing education (CE) for clinical staff via the Internet. 
Upon completion of course(s) and post-test(s) on the Internet, the course participant will receive immediate scoring and then may (print out) CE completion certificates. 
Online clinical courses will include text, graphics, and/or streaming video and include course selections from Nursing and other clinical continuing education in each of the following areas:

A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;     (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-     (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and     (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.     ?Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.     (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:     (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.     The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.     OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.     Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.     Informal forum with the Ombudsman.     Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.     If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.     Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.     In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).     Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.     Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.     If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.     The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.     The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.     Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).     If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.     This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.     To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).     Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

COMDTINST 4200.14 Notice for Filing Agency Protests

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

(1) o Are, 
o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; 

(2) o Have, 
o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;

(4) o Have, 
o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. 

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 

(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 

(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 

(ii) Examples. 
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. 
(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies— 
(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and 
(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. 
(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)

HSAR 3052.209–70 PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES (JUNE 2006). 
    (a) Prohibitions. 
    Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic Corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395 would be, treated as a foreign Corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 

    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 

    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held— 
In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or

    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.   Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).    
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i)    Warrants; 
    (ii)   Options; 
    (iii)  Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv)  Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v)   Others similar interests. 
    (2)   Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835.

1.1	Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14 Notice for Filing Agency Protests          
                                                                               
NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions.  As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for at least 80 percent’ each place it appears. Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)—

(1)	The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2)	After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held—
(i)	In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii)	In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3)	The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.
© Special rules.  The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
Homeland Security Acquisition Regulation (HSAR) Clause 3052.209-70, Prohibition on Contracts with Corporate Expatriates (JUN 2006) (Continued)
(1)	Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:

(ii)	stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2)	Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3)	Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d)	Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman- Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman- Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

<p>(I) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p>(II) This solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). Submit written quotes on RFQ Number NB847000-8-42285SRG.</p>
<p>(III) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-25.</p>
<p>(IV) This procurement is unrestricted and open to all sources. The associated NAICS code is 335999. The business size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>(V) This combined solicitation/synopsis is for purchase of the following commercial items:<br />CLIN 0001:&nbsp;ONE Erbium Fiber Lasers.</p>
<p>(VI) Description of requirements with the following:<br />CLIN 0001: The 5W version of the Erbium Fiber Laser should be centered at 1555.4(+/-0.1) nm with an output power greater or equal to 5 W, power stability better than 1% and a frequency line width smaller or equal to 100 kHz. Below are some further options that are not absolutely necessary, but could be useful for our intended task. <br />If you can offer some of these options and they are non-standard, these should be broken out separately in the quotation.</p>
<p>CLIN 0001 - Option 1: Tunability, not necessary as long as the stated target wavelength is met, otherwise sufficient tuning range should be provided to reach the target wavelength.</p>
<p>CLIN 0002 - Option 2: Stable linear output polarization.</p>

<DESC>This amendment is being issued to EXTEND the solicitation due date to read July 9, 2008 at 3:00 PM


Question 1.  Amendment #1 answer #1 stated the price for the seed project should go on line item 0006 on form 1442.  What is the location of the Alternate #1 pricing?

Answer 1.  The Alternate #1 pricing should be at the bottom of the bottom of page 4 which is Division Description.

Question 2.  Revised drawing A1.2 general note #1 states after demo to replace, repair or level the floor area.  Because of the amount of area involved and the three repair options along with the different cost of those repair options could an allowance or a square footage be given for bidding purposes?

Answer 2.  General Note #1 on the latest revision to Drawing A1.2 (Revision 2) in part reads “PACKAGE BE CONTRACTOR SHOULD REMOVE EXISTING UNDERLAYMENT AND/OR ADD ADDITIONAL LEVELING COMPOUND TO CREATE A SMOOTH TRANSITION ACROSS ENTIRE FLOOR AREA.”  The contractor must decide whether it will be easier and/or less costly to remove some of the existing topping material or to install additional topping to achieve the uniform floor level to comply with the requirement

Question 3.  Drawing A1.1 Demo note 1A states to remove existing masonry wall.  I could not locate symbol 1A on the drawing.  Please Advise.

Answer 3.  There may not be any masonry walls to be removed in this portion of the project.  Note 3 indicates where new door openings are to be cut into masonry walls.

Question 4.  Spec Section 03532 Concrete Floor Topping was one of the revised spec. sections that was issued.  The drawings do not show any work at the elevator 3 location.  The spec. does not really give a scope of work for this area.  Please provide a drawing, scope of the work or some direction of the amount of area to receive concrete topping.

Answer 4. The wrong specification was provided; a revised specification Section 03532 – Hydraulic Cement Underlayment is to be used.  The reference to elevator 3 has been deleted and the technical requirements have been revised

<DESC>Sources Sought Announcement – SS-NCI-TSB-2008-1
Title: Collection and Taxonomy of Shallow Water Marine Organisms
This Source Sought Notice (SS) is for information and planning purposes only
and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the
National Cancer Institute (NCI).
The purpose of this SS is to identify qualified small businesses concerns
[including Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDB), Woman-Owned Small
Businesses (WOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Small
Businesses, Veteran-owned Small Businesses (VOSB) and Service-disabled
Veteran-owned Small Businesses (SDVOB)] that are interested in and capable of
performing the work described herein. The NCI does not intend to award a
contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any
information submitted. As a result of this SS, the NCI may issue a Request for
Proposal (RFP). THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.
However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against NCI
shall arise as a result of a response to this SS or the NCI’s use of such
information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing
specifications for any subsequent requirement. If this project is advertised, it is
anticipated that one (1) cost-reimbursement, completion type contract will be
awarded for a period of five (5) years.
The National Cancer Institute is seeking tailored capability statements from
qualified small business concerns [particularly Small Disadvantaged Businesses
(SDB), Woman-Owned Small Businesses (WOSB), Historically Underutilized
Business Zone (HUBZone) Small Businesses, Veteran-owned Small Businesses
(VOSB) and Service-disabled Veteran-owned Small Businesses (SDVOB)] to
provide support to NCI’s Natural Products Branch (NPB), Developmental
Therapeutics Program (DTP), Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis
(DCTD), NCI. The NCI is seeking a contractor to collect a substantial number of
marine invertebrate samples for extraction and subsequent screening for
antitumor activity. This project is to continue the exploration of marine organisms
from the Tropics and other areas where unusual habitats may have well evolved
more specialized organisms and to use these organisms as a source of potential
new agents (pharmacophores) which can be developed for the selective
treatment of cancers in humans.
The target is to collect, taxonomically identify to species level, and to ship up to
450-500 samples per year (on average) over the five year contract term, of
marine invertebrates (which may include up to 10% of algae/cyanophytes) with
wet weights of roughly 1 kilogram each, in a frozen condition from the collection
sites to NCI-Frederick. In all collections, the major objective of the program is
that the collected species be from as wide a diversity of phyla and classes as is
possible.
The major collection areas will be the tropical and subtropical areas of the
World’s oceans from sea level to ~50 meters. Collections from both niche areas
and from depths exceeding SCUBA depths of ~50 meters may be considered
provided scientific rationales and access to suitable equipment are acceptably
defined and realistically feasible. Collections may be performed by
subcontractors/consultants to the prime contractor. Due to uncertainties,
collections need not be performed in every year of the contract, but the
contractor must have the capacity and requisite expertise to collect,
taxonomically identify to species level, and to ship up to 450-500 samples per
year (on average) over the five year contract term.
Tailored Capability Statements shall demonstrate a clear understanding of all
tasks specified in the draft SOW. Tailored Capability Statements for this
requirement shall address the following ten (10) areas:
(1) Personnel. Quality and extent of the Principal Investigator's (PI) recent
experience, scientific accomplishments, qualifications for organizing this project,
and demonstrated leadership abilities must be addressed. The PI must be
experienced in the organization of collection programs, and should have at least
5 years of direct experience in marine invertebrate collection. The quality and
extent of scientific accomplishments and recent experience of the marine
invertebrate/plant taxonomists either accompanying the collection expeditions
and/or being responsible for the final complete identification of the specimens
obtained must be addressed. Marine taxonomists must be trained in marine
invertebrate taxonomy or a closely related field, preferably Ph.D. level (6 or more
first author papers in taxonomic journals showing their expertise in a specific
phylum/phyla) who will accompany field collections (or receive voucher samples,
etc.) in order to identify the collected species. The proposed Personnel shall
demonstrate that your organization has the necessary expertise to perform the
requirements of this project. Capability Statements must demonstrate that the
personnel experience stated in the Capability Statement occurred in conjunction
with projects comparable in size and complexity. Capability statements must
address the proposed personnel’s knowledge of marine invertebrate fauna and
marine flora of the areas proposed for collection; process for sample collection,
preparation, packaging and shipment from Indo-Pacific and Atlantic Oceanic
areas; taxonomy; familiarity with governmental and local customs of people in the
projected collection areas; knowledge of the regulations and procedures
necessary for operating in the project areas, and for the legal export and
shipment of samples [including knowledge of the Convention on Biodiversity
[CBD] and Convention on International Transport of Endangered Species (CITES
Convention) and their potential impacts]; demonstrated ability to successfully
negotiate and collaborate with authorities and officials on behalf of the project in
the countries of collection; collective recent [within last three years] collection
experience; and availability of all key personnel.
(2) Selection of the collection areas with documented evidence of projected
collaborations with suitable governmental/local organizations in the regions
selected for collections, the timing and scope of the collections, integration with
later large-scale recollections, possible safety hazards, and the advanced
planning required.
(3) Detailed methodology of collecting, minimizing of duplicate species
collections, preparation of samples including storage, preservation of voucher
specimens, taxonomy, labeling and documentation including photography.
(4) Documented experience in shipping of samples and voucher specimens, and
submission of data to designated facilities. Explain process for deep freezing
samples within 4-6 hours of collection, maintaining samples in suitable conditions
prior to freezing, and maintaining a frozen state until delivered to repository in
Frederick, Maryland.
(5) Documented experience in complete identification of samples to species
level.
(6) Enforcement of rulings concerning collections for entities other than NCI.
(7) Documented individual and organizational experience in/with: diving safety;
evidence of rescue diving and resuscitation training/methods; diving safety
manual; evidence of specialized diving including decompression and/or
rebreather diving if collecting below 50 meters depth or experience/safety
concerns in using small manned submersibles. Specify guidelines on safety
procedures and precautions used by the organization in conducting collections
and handling hazardous materials and collections and equipment.
(8) Availability, adequacy and quality of facilities and equipment, including:
library specializing in information on marine flora and fauna of the projected
collection areas; collection, preparation, storage and shipment of samples and
voucher specimens; and identification of specimens.
(9) Effective organizational lines of authority and responsibility for each stage of
the project. Discuss knowledge of local government regulations and
requirements and your firm’s contacts with government officials, marine biologists
and collectors that qualify your organization to undertake collections in these
areas.
(10) Suitability of contacts or relationships with government departments,
officials, institutes or agencies that would facilitate obtaining permits and
collecting specimens.
For information purposes, it is estimated that 8,346 direct labor hours of effort will
be required on a yearly basis.

The information may also include a description of any quality awards earned by the quoter.  The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government.  Quoters lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.

The quoter should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  The assessment of the quoters past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the responder and other competitors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFQ.

<DESC><p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New York District intends to issue an Invitation for Bids (IFB) to award a contract for the deepening of the existing elevation of the S-AM-2 Contract 7 Federal Navigation Channel System from the existing 47 to 49 feet (MLW) to a depth of 53 feet (MLW). The project area is located in Ambrose Channel at the entrance of New York/New Jersey Harbor, east of Staten Island. The project consists of dredging and placement of non-rock materials in an upland site provided by the contractor.<br /><br />The contractor must have a dredge capable of operating at a minimum of 53 feet of water, and transporting the materials to an upland site provided by the contractor. The scheduling of future dredging work may be dependent upon the rapid completion of this work. In addition, the contractor must be capable of working in an active navigation channel with frequent ship traffic. The contract will therefore be required to relocate to allow for passage into the harbor.<br /><br />This procurement is being solicited as UNRESTRICTED, full and open competition to all business concerns. The applicable NAICS CODE is 237990, Dredging and Surface Cleanup Activities. The small business size is $18,500,000.00. The SIC Code is 1629, Heavy Construction, not elsewhere classified. The estimated construction cost is $20,000,000.00. Small Business Goals: If a large business, the prime contractor shall provide its small business subcontracting plan conforming to the requirements of FAR 19.704 and DFARS 219.7. The small business goals are as follows: Small Business 70.0%, Small Disadvantaged Business 6.5%, HUBzone Small Business 9.8%, Women-Owned Small Business 7.5%, Veteran-Owned Small Business 4.0%, Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business 2.0%. A subcontracting plan reflecting goals less than indicated shall provide, as part of the subcontracting plan submission, those extenuating circumstances of why the goal can not be met. You may contact the District, the deputy Small Business advocate, or your local SBA for assistance. A contract will not be awarded until the Contracting Officer has determined that the subcontracting plan provides maximum practicable opportunities for Small, Veteran-Owned Small Business, Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, Hubzone Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, and Women-Owned Small Business program concerns to participate in contract performance. The selected contractor will be required to commence work within 5 calendar days after the date the Contractor receives the Notice to Proceed, prosecute the work diligently, and complete the work no later than 730 calendar days for the entire project, after the date the Contractor receives the Notice to Proceed. The time stated for completion shall include final cleanup of the premises. The Federal Acquisition Regulation requires that Past Performance Information (PPI) be collected on Department of Defense (DoD) contracts. The Government has now implemented a web-enabled application that collects and manages contractor past performance data. Effective 1 April 2007, the system, CONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT REPORTING SYSTEM (CPARS), requires both the contractor and the Government to submit their portion of the CPARS report via the internet for Construction contracts in excess of $100,000.00. More definitive guidance and instructions will be incorporated in the solicitation and resultant contract. In the meantime, to become familiar with the system, the CPARS website has a computer-based training module and a practice session for your use at https://www.nwp.usace.army.mil/ct/I/home.asp by following the links to the Training. Plans/Specs for the subject project would be available on/about 4 June 2008 with bid opening on/about 7 July 2008. Bids are to be submitted to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Contracting Division, Room 1843, 26 Federal Plaza, New York, NY 10278. The media selected for issuance of Synopsis/Solicitation and amendments shall solely be at the discretion of the Government; accordingly, the media utilized for this project shall be the Internet and CD-ROM. TELEPHONE, EMAIL, OR FAX REQUESTS FOR THE SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED OR HONORED. Paper copies of this solicitation and amendment if any will not be available or issued. Interested parties may download and print the solicitation at no charge from the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website, http://www.fbo.gov. All vendors who want access to the solicitation will be required to register with Central Contractor Registration (CCR) (www.ccr.gov) and FedBizOpps (http://www.fbo.gov).
