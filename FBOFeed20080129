This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the acquisition of NetApp Storage Solutions (Immix Technology).  The use of a brand name description is essential to the IRM/EOCýs operational requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the services of another company. IRM/OPS/SIO/ESOC has already implemented the NetApp Enterprise Storage hardware and software, provided by NetApp, which is essential for the ESOC to store large amounts of data and to satisfy the customerýs storage solutions.  NetApp FAS systems are the industryýs broadest family of compatible storage systems, offering unmatched business agility, superior application uptime, simplicity of management, and low TCO. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractorýs unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the services identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only services that meet the defined requirements.  This is a renewal request of our current backup solution which in the past has allowed us to protect our customers data in a manner that aligns with the current National Security procedures and protects us from the possibility of being tempered with by unknown and/or second hand vendors that may not be particularly familiar with the sensitivity of the product or our mission.<BR><BR>

<DESC>Background

The Legislative Resource Center (LRC) within the Office of the Clerk of the House of Representatives assists with the dissemination of legislative information and records of the U.S. House of Representatives to Congressional entities and the public. The Legislative Resource Center provides centralized access to all public disclosure documents originated and produced by the House of Representatives.  In addition, the Public Information section within the LRC provides printing services in support of the business needs of the House of Representatives. Most of the printing services provided is in support of the Immediate Office of the Clerk, Members of Congress and House Committees.  However, support is also provided to the Chief Administrative Officer, the Sergeant at Arms, and other House administrative offices as requested. 

Printing requests vary in size, volume, and frequency; but almost all requests must be completed and delivered within a very short period of time. Miscellaneous requests such as brochures may require finishing features such as binding, stapling, trimming, drilling (hole punching), inserting pre-printed material, or utilizing various grades of paper stock for each copy.   Requests for daily high volume jobs, such as House Committee hearings, House bills, and House reports may result in upwards of 100,000 printed pages per month. Currently, 80% of all requests are for high volume print jobs and must be printed the same day.  

Daily print jobs are received electronically in postscript format.  Semi-annual and ad-hoc reports can be received electronically either in a PDF format, word processing document with jpeg or tiff graphics inserted in the documents, or in hard copy form.  House Committee hearings are printed on demand and are routed directly to the high speed printer from the Office of Official Reporters.  Smaller or ad-hoc print jobs are hand delivered or emailed to the Document Production staff and managed from their individual workstations.  Depending on printing demands or requirements of the print job, the document can be routed to other printers on the network.

LRC currently uses two production printers to provide internal printing services for its customers. The main printer is a Canon imageRunner 110 (Canon iR110) which produces black and white documents at a rate of 110 pages per minute. This printer is used for producing high volume print jobs or publications that require finishing features such as saddle stitch finishing, corner stapling, double stapling, the addition of covers using 90 pound cover stock or inserting pre printed materials within a single print job.  The secondary printer is a Canon imageRunner 105 (Canon iR105). The Canon iR105 is also a black and white printer that produces 105 pages per minute.  This printer is used for producing smaller documents and also serves as a backup printer to the Canon iR110.  Documents that are printed on the iR105 may require finishing features such as saddle stitch finishing, corner stapling, double stapling and three-hole drilling. Both printers reside in the same limited work area within LRC.  The Canon iR110 printer also serves as a backup printer in the production of reports from the Legislative Information Management System (LIMS). LIMS currently uses a Xerox DocuTech 6180 printer as its main printer. LIMS produces high volume reports weekly and periodically, upon request, at other times of the year.  The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) bill tracking report is printed every Monday and the Legislative Activity Guide (LAG) reports are produced periodically throughout the year. The Canon iR110 printer is used to print these reports when the Xerox DocuTech 6180 printer is unavailable.

Purpose

The Canon iR110 no longer meets the requirements of The Office of Clerk. The current controller configuration does not provide the needed functionality to allow the operators to set up printer queues with specific print specifications. Print jobs that are sent remotely are sent to one print queue and automatically printed. If jobs are to be held for printing at a later date, the operator must intervene before the job is printed.  This greatly reduces the overall effectiveness of print production operations.  To meet expanding needs of the Office of the Clerk, the LRC desires to replace the Canon iR105 with an upgraded color equivalent that has equal or greater print quality and capabilities.  

LRC provides on demand printing services throughout the legislative session, including time beyond the normal business hours. Normal service and maintenance on each of the printers will require on-call maintenance service and a response time within 4 business hours.   The House reserves the right to exercise "In Session Hours" which require a maximum of 2 business hours response time and require a 24/7 response during said period.  The House will provide as much notice as possible to the Contractor of need to exercise "In Session Hours".

"In Session Hours" are defined as those periods when the House is in session for an expanded period of time and the LRC requires an excelerated response time - 2 hours versus the normal 4 business hours.  

Description of Work

The Legislative Resource Center (LRC)  wishes to improve its printing services by removing two of their main production printers; 1) the Canon iR110 and 2) the Canon iR105 and replacing them with printers with improved performance and technology features. This requires Contractor support in four (4) task areas:
		
		1. 	Remove the Canon iR110 printer and the Canon iR105 printer from the premises.
		2. 	Deliver and install a new high speed black and white printer to replace the Canon iR110 printer and provide 
			technical support and maintenance to the operating system, print production software and print production
			equipment. 
		3. 	Deliver and install a new color printer to replace the Canon iR105 printer and provide technical support and 
			maintenance to print software and equipment.
		4.  	Train of up to five (5) LRC staff members on the operation of both replacement printers, print production 
			software and any attached peripheral equipment.

Prior to such removal, the Contractor shall provide a schedule of events including a timeline for such removal. The House COR must approve the schedule for removal prior to the Contractor beginning any portion of the removal.

It is requested that the Contractor provide regular maintenance and repair service for the printer by a team of certified technicians with no less than two years of service experience on the equipment being purchased and who can meet the legislative work schedule of the operators of this equipment. Therefore, the Contractor is expected to furnish a proposed maintenance plan outlining the ability to provide 24/7 onsite technical and mechanical user support for the printer with a maximum four hour normal response time for each incident and two hour response time when the House exercises the "In Session Hours" option. In addition, the Contractor must be able to offer a minimum of two preventative maintenance service calls per month within their service contract. It is required that the Contractor have all parts and equipment located within a 150 mile radius of the Washington Metropolitan area.
       This printer must be accompanied by a controller and associated software that allows ease of operation for the operators. The software must allow the operators to set up separate print queues based on print job specifications.

Task 3: Replacement of the Canon iR105 Black and White Printer with a Color Printer
The Contractor will replace the Canon iR105 black and white printer with a color printer that meets all environmental and electrical requirements specified as a result of any pre-proposal determinations. The printer must physically fit within the work area whereby all access doors and panels have sufficient room to open fully and allow technicians and operators to perform their duties without restrictions. The printer must meet all mandatory specifications as outlined in the printer requirements document in Appendix B. This printer is expected to be operational 24/7, so it is mandatory that this printer be robust with an absolute minimum of down time.  It is requested that the Contractor provide regular maintenance provide regular maintenance and repair services for the printer by a team of certified technicians with no less than two years of service experience on the equipment being purchased and who can meet the legislative work schedule of the operators of this equipment.

THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION.

The purpose of this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is to solicit research proposals for Chemical and Biological Defense Program, Defense Threat Reduction Agency requirements for the Chemical and Biological Defense Initiative Fund (CBDIF) BAA and the Physical Science & Technology (S&T) Division New Initiatives BAA.

SCOPE:

The DoD CBDP, Defense Threat Reduction Agency, and the Joint Science and Technology Office for Chemical and Biological Defense (JSTO-CBD) are seeking optimum approaches to meet technology objectives within both the Physical Science & Technology and the Medical Science & Technology areas for the CBDIF, and the Physical Science & Technology New Initiatives.

PURPOSE:

The CBDIF goal is to fund new and innovative chemical and biological science and technology projects across a wide range of military operations. Established in FY2003, it is Congressionally directed with the intent to provide funds via a competitive acquisition to non-Government entities. Proposals may only address those topics presented in Attachment 8 of the BAA.

The Physical Science & Technology Division, Chemical and Biological Technologies Directorate, in its continuing mission, seeks new and innovative ideas for experimental and theoretical development of technologies to fill DoD requirements for chemical and biological defense. The goal is to identify and select science and technology projects that can be transitioned to joint acquisition programs. Proposals may only address those topics presented in Attachment 8 of the BAA.

SOLICITATION APPROACH AND OVERVIEW:

This BAA is a multi-year BAA, remaining effective for three years from the initial date of issuance, unless amended otherwise. Multiple calls for proposals may occur in conjunction with this BAA. The topics and timelines (Attachment 8) published in the initial issuance are firm. In the future, ongoing, new or emerging requirements may necessitate amendment of the BAA to include new or different topics. At any time that the topics are amended, new proposal submission milestones (timelines) will be specified and as applicable any limitations specific to the topics will be noted.

Over the span of its term, this BAA will solicit basic research, applied research, and advanced technology development proposals for the topics presented in Attachment 8 and in effect at the time. Depending on the nature of requirements and/or available funding, each of these research categories may or may not be included in the most current List of Topics. Proposals may each address Basic Research, or Applied Research and/or Advanced Technology Development as specified in each topic. Proposals will not be accepted or considered that combine Basic Research with Applied Research and/or Advanced Technology Development.

The Government encourages proposals that span a wide spectrum of possible technical and business solutions in response to the specific technology topics stated in Attachment 8 of this BAA. The Government reserves the right to award any combination of approaches which offer the best overall value to the Government, and to oversee any and all processes and approaches once ongoing.

The full range of flexible assistance and acquisition related statutory authority arrangements available to DTRA are possible results from this announcement including but not limited to contracts, grants, and Other Transaction Agreements. Each of the several applicable procurement instruments offer different advantages, liabilities and responsibilities for offerors and the Government.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE.  The Naval Air 
Systems Command intends to award a Sole Source Delivery Order under Basic Ordering Agreement N00019-05-G-0026 to McDonnell Douglas Corporation (MDC), a subsidiary of The Boeing Company, St Louis, MO, for an Alternate Signal Source for Power Margin Indicator for the AV-8B Harrier.  The T/AV8B Engine Monitoring Unit (EMU) has an obsolescence issue.  Removal of the 
EMU from the T/AV8B renders the Power Margin Indicator (PMI) display in the Heads Up Display (HUD) inoperable.  This procurement provides an alternate signal source and necessary aircraft software, which allows the PMI to operate 
correctly with or without an EMU in the aircraft.  MDC will update publication from the source data of Red Line Publication Markups and Val/Ver comments provided by FST Cherry Point; will identify and update all ILS elements (Drawings, LSA, LSAR, Provisioning Data/Spares, DCN, Maint Plans,) from source data provided by FST Cherry Point; and  FST will review all Boeing drawing updates.

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to issue a sole source solicitation to Innovative Defense Strategies (IDS), LLC, 2100 N. Ocean Blvd, Suite PH26A, Ft. Lauderdale, FL 33305 under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1).  This procurement is for engineering, technical and professional support services to develop open system procurement recommendations that can facilitate and streamline the Navy?s transition to open systems procurements.  Richard Carroll, owner of IDS facilitated the successful implementation of the Navy?s first Open Architecture (OA) engineering environment, under the Navy Submarine Acoustic Rapid COTS Insertion (ARCI) program.  Given its success, the ARCI program has become a business and technical model for Navy OA, which NAVSEA intends to implement across all ship platforms.  Therefore, IDS possesses the experience necessary to make open system procurement recommendations to NAVSEA.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, China Lake, intends to procure a Linux Cluster Computer on a full and open unrestricted basis.  The cluster computer will be an architecture tailored for supporting scientific computing applications.  Typically, cluster computers consist of a single management node and any number of compute nodes assembled into one or more rack units.  There are requirements for a LINUX based operating system with cluster management software, high speed node interconnect network, memory, disk storage, power supply and system data backup capabilities.  Other than the necessary operating system software there is no application software being purchased.   The system as delivered must be a fully functional LINUX-based cluster computer requiring site-provided standard external power and normal air conditioning for cooling.  The following are minimum requirements.  Alteration of these requirements is acceptable if the functionality of the given !    requirement is met with other offered hardware or software.  CLUSTER HARDWARE:  1. One cluster management node:  a) 4 Gb memory  b) 250 Gb disk  2.  Compute nodes:  a) Minimum of 32 compute nodes b) Single dual-core processor or two single-core CPU's per compute node c) 2 Gb memory per compute node d) Vendor should provide pricing information that can be used to determine complete system cost for initial purchase of up to 64 compute nodes.  3.  Gigabit Ethernet internal cluster network.  4.  Ethernet external network capable.  5.  1 Tb usable RAID disk storage.  6.  Redundant power supplies on management and compute nodes  7.  Crash kit:  a)  Provides for immediate hardware replacement in case of specific system failures.  This should include a management node mother board, cooling fans, a disk for compute nodes and a RAID disk.  System architectures that provide redundant capabilities will not need to provide crash kit hardware for those specific hardware items.  8.   Ra!  ck mounted system monitor and keyboard.  9.  Rack mounted CD-ROM, CD-R , DVD-ROM, DVD-R (single drive meeting all requirements will suffice).  10. Uninteruptable Power Supply (UPS) capable of sustaining system operation for 10 minutes after external power outage.  Cluster system should be configurable to provide for automatic system shutdown at some predetermined time after external power outage.  System does not need to be able to automatically restart after a power outage.  CLUSTER SOFTWARE:  1. LINUX-based Operating System (OS).  2. Cluster Management Software.  3. System Management Software capable of managing user accounts, external network connectivity, system security, etc.  4. Health monitoring software capable of providing system performance data and diagnosing system failures.  5. There is no requirement for user job queuing software.  Standard system job scheduling is sufficient.  MISCELLANEOUS HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS:  1.  Tape back-up system capable of      performing (1) full back-up of the RAID array and daily partial back-ups for !  two weeks (10 partial back-ups) assuming that no more than 20% of the RAID storage is required to be saved in any single partial back-up.  Magnetic tape is specified as the "minimum".  Other options may be acceptable.  2.  Vendor must provide facility requirements including: a)  Total power including number and type of power connections.  b)  Total system cooling requirements, preferably in Btu/hr.  c)  System floor space requirements.  INSTALLATION AND WARRANTY: 1. Vendor must provide complete maintenance coverage for hardware and system software for a period of three years.  2. Vendor must provide the cost for optional hardware and system software maintenance for two additional years.   SYSTEM PERFORMANCE:  1. Vendor must provide system performance data for a benchmark case provided by the Navy.  The application software can be obtained (free of charge) from the POC provided below.  There are  a number of options for compiling, linking, and target processor.  The applicat!  ion uses standard MPI libraries.  The specific application is OVERFLOW  2.1a.  The specific benchmark case may have been executed prior to responding to this acquisition on a representative system (same CPU, internal network, memory and disk architecture).  If this is the case, the vendor may provide the benchmark data for that system and note any differences between that system and the quoted system which could affect the benchmark results as well as how the benchmark would be affected.  2. The system must be capable of running both 32-bit and 64-bit applications.  3.  The system should allow for portability of software vendor applications.  At a minimum, it should be expected that a vendor's application that has been compiled on a similar architecture should run on the quoted system without being compiled on the quoted system.  Stated differently, there should be no system or vendor specific restrictions on porting applications.  For instance, it should not be required, on the quoted system, to use unique vendor supplied libraries (MPI, etc.)!   in order to run an application code.  It may be that performance optimization could be enhanced by recompiling and linking on the quoted system, but it should not be required, in general. Complete details will be provided in the solicitation or Request for Quote (RFQ).  The proposed LINUX Cluster Computer must meet or exceed performance specifications as listed in the solicitation.  The solicitation will be posted in the Navy Electronic Commerce Online website at http://www.neco.navy.mil and the FEDBIZOPPS website at http://vsearch2.eps.gov/servlet/SearchServlet on or about 28 June 2007.  All responsible sources must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database at the following website: https://www.ccr.dlis.dla.mil/ccr/scripts/index.html.  Responses must include all information requested in the   written RFQ.  All responsible offers will be considered for award.  This evaluation will be in accordance with FAR 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for the procurement of mission critical services in Star City, Russia.  The Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center (GCTC) will furnish office space and living quarters for NASA personnel and astronauts training on the Russian Soyuz vehicles as well as personnel that travel with the crew.  The office space and living quarters must be co-located with the training facilities. NASA/JSC intends to contract with GCTC for these services on a sole source basis for a period of 3 years and 9 months, through December 31, 2011.  GCTC remains a tightly controlled facility and our facilities there serve as a combination of living quarters and crew quarters during training and prior to launch and after landing.  The crews are located onsite with the classrooms and facilities in a secure location.  GCTC is the current contractor and since the requirement for housing and office requirements must take place on the Russian Air Force Base where the Russian Soyuz vehicle training is provided, GCTC is the only entity to contract with in order to gain access to the secure facility.   The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26.

<DESC>The purpose of this synopsis is for the Naval Air Systems Command Program Manager, AIR 276 (NAVAIR PMA-276) to post a Request For Information (RFI) for process, physical distribution, and logistics consulting services (NAICS 541614) under the H-1 Aviation Depot Level Repairable (AVDLR) Repair Program as well as to announce an Industry Day.  NAVAIR PMA-276 is: 1) Conducting market research of industry, 2) Identifying sources who have the skills, experience, qualifications, and knowledge required to support a potential H-1 component repair material availability strategy, and 3) To exchange ideas with industry on how to best accomplish the outcomes. This is NOT a formal Request for Proposals.  

PART I: BACKGROUND INFORMATION
H-1 material support process alternatives are being considered for a DoD Depot Maintenance Organization (DoD DMO) in Corpus Christi, TX to provide increased availability of parts used in the AVDLR Repair Program.  The DoD DMO purchases material from multiple sources to accomplish H-1 AVDLR component repair.  The non-availability of parts has led to increased Repair Turn Around Time (RTAT), therefore, impacting fleet readiness.  Parts availability is influenced by demand forecasting, as well as vendor production lead times and vendor/supplier capacity constraints.  The proposed solution should resolve issues and find ways to integrate support solutions.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.   A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.  The National Institute Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, Office of Acquisitions, The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Branch, intends to negotiate a 5 month extension to the contract with NeoMPS Inc. to continue operations of Peptide facility.   The extension is required because of delays in a planned FY2007 acquisition for this requirement. The planned extension will permit the repository to continue to function and provide compounds for on going clinical trials while a new acquisition is conducted for these services.  The proposed extension will prevent a lapse in service until a new contract can be awarded. NeoMPS has been operating the Peptide facility under Contract N01-HD-23339 since 2002. The requirements of the contract are: 1.Synthesize, purify and characterize specific peptides requested by the Work Assignment Order in the amounts designated and furnish them to the Contraception and Reproductive Health Branch or distribute them as requested by the Project Officer. The peptides may be synthesized batch wise or in one large batch, but the final purification shall be performed by combining all batches and purifying them as a single batch. Guidelines for current Good Manufacturing Practices must be followed when specifically requested by the Project Officer for all peptides designated for toxicology and/or clinical studies.  Provide evidence of purity and characterization (as detailed below in item #6) for all peptides submitted. Ordinarily, the minimum purity of submitted must be 95 %; however, a minimum purity of 97% may be required. The final decision with regard to purity specifications and acceptability will be made by the Project Officer. All work shall be performed in compliance with OSHA regulations and guidelines for protection of the employees. 2. Provide a long-acting formulation(s) with sustained release of peptides for a period of three month or longer, utilizing a subcontractor when necessary as requested by the Project Officer. Prior to submission, it is advised that sufficient quantities of prototype of long-acting peptide formulation(s) should be submitted to the branch=s biological testing facility for evaluation of duration of action. 3. Submit a ACompound Submission Form (NIH-1966)@ (See Attachment VII), describing physical and chemical properties, for each peptide, particularly reverse phase HPLC including blown out (off-scale) version, capillary zone electrophoresis (cze) analysis and LC/MS Ion spray.  4. Undertake HPLC analysis of peptide stability testing at 5?, 25? and 40? C and pyrogen-free testing when requested by the Project Officer (See USP XXII National Formulary XVII ? 211. 166 Stability testing (a), (b), and c and; ? 211.167 Special Testing requirements for sterility and pyrogen-free testing, page 1679 (1990))5.Furnish, package and distribute all peptides synthesized and lyophilized under the contract, as requested by the Project Officer, in the amounts designated, together with evidence of purity and characterization including but not limited to LC-MS, HPLC, TLC, CZE, optical rotation, qualitative amino acid analysis, mass spectral analysis, NMR and mixed and parallel chromatogram of the peptide(s) against the standard peptide(s) to be furnished by the Project Officer. A functional group analysis by TLC spray reagent, evidence of electrophoretic homogeneity may also be required as well as sequence analysis of the peptides. An additional requirement for peptides prepared under cGMP guidelines will be water, salt and C, H & N analysis (including ash content) and an estimate of peptide content.

 In addition, it would take another contractor approximately $50,000 to transfer compounds currently in process that would result in a duplication of costs that is not expected to be recovered through competition as well as possible delays in the processing of compounds needed for 6 months.   However, if there are sources who feel they are able to perform the requirement, they must respond by submitting information required in Numbered Note 22 within 45 days of publication of this synopsis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The capability statement will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Overnight deliveries should be mailed to the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Contracts Management Branch, 6100 Executive Boulevard, Suite 7AO7, Bethesda, Maryland 20852.  No collect calls or facsimile transmissions will be accepted.

Work will include all demolition, structural, plumbing, ductwork, controls and electrical necessary for complete installation. 2.	The design will meet all VA HVAC design criteria for surgical areas.  Due to the VA mandates for 100% outside air for surgical HVAC systems, the design may have to exceed the accepted ASHRAE criteria for both wet and dry bulb temperatures for the Amarillo area and consider design values used by HVAC firms familiar with conditions in the Texas Panhandle in order to ensure that the design meets VA standards for temperature and humidity values. 3.	The design will also include modifications to the standard VA Test and Balance specification to include that testing of temperature and humidity values, in addition to airflow, is required before final acceptance of the project.  The final Test and Balance specification will ensure the VA OR design criteria for temperature and humidity is met before the project is considered complete. 4.	The A/E shall provide a detailed construction cost estimate based on the contract drawings and specifications.  All designs are to be to VA design criteria.  The A/E firm must have an active production office within a 400 mile radius of Amarillo, Texas, and must be a 100% small business.  Submission of SF 330's are due NLT February 28, 2008.  Estimated construction cost is $250,000 - $500,000.  NOTE: SUBJECT TO THE AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>This synopsis publicizes contract actions proposed to support the US Army Engineering and Support Centers Facility Repair and Renewal (FRR) Program.  The purpose of the FRR program is to support its various customers throughout the Continental Unite d States, District of Columbia, Alaska, Hawaii, and U.S. Territories and possessions with their facility repair, renovation, conversion, alteration, addition, construction, equipment procurement/installation, and maintenance requirements.  In order to acco mplish this objective, the FRR program proposes to award multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts, under which firm-fixed price (FFP), cost-plus-incentive-fee (CPIF), or time and materials (T&M) task orders may be issued for the p rovision of stand-alone repair/renewal services or a combination of repair/renewal and supplemental A-E services (i.e. Design-Build).  Specifically, task orders may be awarded for work to be performed through-out the United States, including Alaska, Hawaii, and all US territories, for the following Government agencies: Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, National Aeron autics and Space Administration (NASA), Department of Veteran Affairs, State Department, Department of Interior, Department of Energy, Department of Transportation, and state and local governments.  Prior Government contract experience is not required for receiving an award under the planned solicitation.  However, all construction performance must be in compliance with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Safety and Health Requirements Manual, EM 385-1-1 and must also comply with all Federal, State and  local laws, ordinances, codes, and regulations.  Offerors may propose this requirement as a sole contractor, prime contractor with subcontractor(s), a joint venture, or a teaming arrangement.  Performance and payment bonding is required for all maintenanc e, repair, renewal, and construction efforts.  Offerors must be able to perform multiple contracts (task orders) simultaneously in various geographic locations.  Offerors must have the ability to bond the construction efforts at a minimum of $5,000,000 per  task and $25,000,000 aggregate.  Offerors must have the capability to perform Site Investigations; provide Feasibility Studies; develop Designs/Work Plans; and perform construction, repair, or maintenance efforts to include  architectural, mechanical, ele ctrical, civil, structural, instrumentation, communications, security, force protection, safety, systems, and cost, as well as environmental and hazardous materials abatement areas of Government facilities.  Offerors must have the capability to perform al l work efforts required under this contract at Government facilities in accordance with all applicable technical publications, codes, and specifications.  Repair and construction experience is required.  The proposed ordering period is for one (1) base year and four (4) one-year option periods.  The total programmatic repair/renewal requirements expected to be awarded under the FRR construction (with design-build capabilities) contracts are anticipated to equal approximately $500,000,000.  The Government will conduct three separate competitions for award of multiple ID/IQ construction (with design-build capabilities) contracts to support this programs repair/renewal requirements (one unrestricted, one rest ricted for competition amongst 8(a) small businesses, and one restricted for competition amongst HUBZone small businesses).  This synopsis publicizes a proposed solicitation (request for proposal) for the restricted 8(a) competition.  Any contract(s) resul ting from the proposed solicitation is set-aside for 8(a) small business concerns. Offers from other than 8(a) small business concerns will not be considered.  The unrestricted competition and the HUBZone restricted competition will be publicized and solic ited separately under solicitation numbers W912DY-06-R-0029 and W912DY- 07-R-0033, respectively.  Of the total $500,000,000 programmatic capacity, the total capacity of $276,000,000 is estimated for the unrestricted MATOC pool, $112,000,000 is estimated for the 8(a) MATOC pool, and $112,000,000 is estimated for the HUBZone MAT OC pool.  Each MATOC total capacity will be shared amongst all awardees in the MATOC pool.  A more detailed description of the acquisition strategy will be provided in the solicitation documents.   The 8(a) restricted solicitation will be made available to interested parties through the Federal Business Opportunities website at www.fedbizopps.gov, after the closing date of this synopsis.  Technical data (i.e. Division 01 Specifications) required to r espond to the solicitation will not be furnished as part of the solicitation but may be obtained at https://www.fedteds.gov, after the closing date of this synopsis.

<DESC>SOL:  W912EF-08-R-0023<BR><BR>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Walla Walla District, CENWW, 201 North 3rd Avenue, Walla Walla, WA  99362, intends to issue a Sole Source Firm Fixed Price Base plus three option Periods award to OSU-Cooperative Fish an d Wildlife Unit to provide continuing ongoing work to evaluate the impacts of Avian Predation on Salmonid Smolts from the Columbia and Snake Rivers.   Under the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) 2006 Draft Remand BiOP Avian Predation Proposed Action ; the Corps of Engineers has an obligation to provide the region with information on the impacts of predation on juvenile salmonids and whether management actions are warranted.  The installation of new spillway passage weirs on the Snake River, delayed st art of juvenile fish transportation programs, will likely increase the impacts of avian predation on juvenile salmonids; particularly selective predation on steelhead.  The OSU-Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Unit has been conducting this research since 1997  and is a sole source that has developed specific knowledge of PIT tag deposition rates on Crescent and Foundation Islands, cormorant social attraction methods, Caspian tern and cormorant monitoring technizues, cormorant nesting platforms, PIT tag recovery  techniques, bio-energetic modeling, stock-specific predation rate analysis, PIT tag detection efficiency methodology, PIT tag deposition rates, kleptoparasitism rates, and smolt vulnerability analysis.  This study is ongoing and it is essential to maintai n study continuity.   The statutory authority for permitting other than full and open competition for this requirement, 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), and implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one  responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.<BR><BR>The proposed contract features a base year and three option years. <BR>CONTRACTOR SERVICES: SCOPE OF WORK  CY2008<BR><BR>Scope of Work  FY2008<BR><BR>1.  Proje ct Title:  Evaluate the Impacts of Avian Predation on Salmonid Smolts from the Columbia and Snake Rivers <BR><BR>2. Appropriation:  Construction General, Columbia River Fish Mitigation Program<BR><BR>3. Purpose and Scope:   Research is needed to evaluate t he impact of avian predation on salmonid smolts from Caspian terns on Crescent Island and Double-crested cormorants on Foundation Island located below the confluence of the Snake and Columbia rivers.  In 2006, the Crescent Island tern colony consisted of a pproximately 448 breeding pairs and the Foundation cormorant colony consisted of approximately 360 breeding pairs.  Salmonid smolts represented about 68%, 70%, 65%, and 65% of the tern diet on Crescent Island in 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006 which is signific antly higher than East Sand Island at 24%, 17%, 23%, and 32% during the respective years. Consumption of both Snake and Columbia River juvenile salmonids by the Crescent Island tern colony was estimated at approximately 440,000, 470,000, and 440,000 smolts  in 2003, 2004, and 2005.  These are minimum consumption estimates and do not include kleptoparasitism by the California gull colony surrounding the Crescent Island tern colony. Snake River steelhead incurred the highest predation rate at 34.7% and 16.7% i n 2004 and 2005 when corrected for PIT tag collision, detection efficiency, and PIT tag deposition.  It is important to note that these are minimum predation rates based on the proportion of PIT-tagged smolts last detected at Lower Monumental Dam and subse quently recovered on the Crescent Island tern colony. <BR><BR>As identified in the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) 2006 Draft Remand Biological Opinion (BiOp) Proposed Actions (PA), and the 2007 Federal Columbia River Power System (FCRPS) Biologic al Assessment (BA), the long term goal for Crescent Island Caspian terns and Foundation Island cormorants is to determine the impact of predation on juvenile sa lmonids and whether management actions are warranted. <BR>The Corps also plans to develop and implement an avian management plan for Corps-owned lands, including avian colonies on Crescent Island, and associated shallow-water habitat.  The primary objectiv e of this plan will be to improve Endangered Species Act (ESA)-listed anadromous fish survival for fish rearing and migrating through the lower Snake and Columbia rivers. <BR><BR>The installation of new spillway passage weirs on the Snake River, delayed st art of the juvenile fish transportation program, and efforts to leave more fish migrating inriver, may increase the impacts of avian predation on juvenile salmonids; particularly selective predation on steelhead. The ability to determine the impact of avia n predation on juvenile salmonids from Caspian terns and cormorants on Crescent Island and Foundation Island require specific techniques and methodologies, analysis procedures, and equipment in order to maintain continuity of data and regional acceptabilit y of the work.  This includes specific knowledge of (PIT tag deposition rates on Crescent and Foundation Islands, cormorant social attraction methods, Caspian tern and cormorant monitoring techniques, cormorant nesting platforms, PIT tag recovery technique s, bio-energetic modeling, stock-specific predation rate analysis, PIT tag detection efficiency methodology, PIT tag deposition rates, kleptoparasitism rates, and smolt vulnerability analysis). <BR><BR>4.  OSU Obligation:	<BR><BR>     a. The Oregon State U niversity (OSU) - US Geological Service Oregon Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit, shall conduct the following research objectives.  All work described shall be conducted in the 2008-2009 calendar year, with the exception of the draft and final re ports.    <BR><BR>          Objective 1:  The OSU shall research, monitor, and evaluate predation on salmonid smolts by Caspian terns on the Columbia Plateau.<BR><BR>	   Task 1.1.  The OSU shall determine colony size, habitat use, nesting success, and fact ors limiting colony size and nesting success of the Caspian tern colony on Crescent Island.  Multiple counts will be conducted in order to calculate 95% confidence limits for the estimate of the number of breeding pairs.  Data will also be collected on gul l kleptoparasitism rates on terns, disturbance rates to the tern colony, predation rates on tern nests, and other causes of tern nesting failure in order to evaluate those factors that limit nesting success at the Crescent Island Caspian tern colony.<BR><B R>              Task 1.2.   The OSU shall determine diet composition and consumption of juvenile salmonids by Caspian terns nesting on Crescent Island.  The taxonomic composition of the diet of Caspian terns nesting on Crescent Island will be determined by  direct observation of adults as they return to the colony with fish.  The OSU shall identify prey salmonid species as salmon or steelhead and estimate annual smolt consumption for the Crescent Island Caspian tern colony using the bio-energetic modeling ap proach (95% confidence intervals will be calculated for estimates of smolt consumption by terns).<BR><BR>    Task 1.3.   The OSU shall determine species and stock-specific predation rates on juvenile salmonids from the Snake and Columbia rivers by Caspian terns nesting on Crescent Island using derived estimates from bio-energetic modeling and PIT tags recovered from the island.  The OSU shall detect and recover PIT tags from the Crescent Island tern colony in August using previously established methods to e stimate PIT tag detection efficiency and deposition rates in order to determine species and stock specific predation rates (95% confidence intervals will be calculated for estimates of predation by terns).   <BR>To measure PIT tag detection efficiency, OSU  shall sow PIT tags in four discrete plots on four different locations on Crescent Island.  Detection efficiency estimates will be calculated relative to the so wing date and plot, thereby describing both temporal and spatial variation in detection efficiency.<BR><BR><BR>              Task 1.4.   The OSU shall determine how various biotic and abiotic factors are associated with differences in smolt vulnerability t o predation on Snake River steelhead by Crescent Island Caspian terns. Steelhead will be collected from the Smolt Monitoring Sample at Lower Monumental Dam and Ice Harbor dams April-July.  Steelhead will also be collected from the Chelan County PUD - Rock Island Dam by-pass facility in May. The recorded condition of a fish will be attached to a specific tag code and vulnerability to avian predation will be evaluated using PIT tag recovery data collected from the avian bird colonies.  The desired weekly samp le is 500 fish per week from the lower Snake River and 900 per week from the mid-Columbia River.<BR>	The OSU shall conduct a pilot study whereby a sub-sample of the steelhead used in this study are screened to evaluate fish pathology and whole body chemist ry as a measure of fish health.  Both lethal and non-lethal screening techniques will be investigated through collaborative work with U.C. Davis/NOAA Fisheries and USGS.  Screening will be conducted using established protocols.<BR>	In addition to biotic fa ctors, OSU shall investigate how abiotic factors are associated with differences in smolt vulnerability to predation by piscivorous water birds.   OSU shall investigate abiotic factors including water temperature, inflow, outflow, spill levels, spill durat ion, and turbidity.  OSU will determine differences in predation rates associated with fish length, weight, condition, origin, abundance, and release date.  <BR>	OSU will continue to work collaboratively with NOAA Fisheries to utilize existing and future t elemetry data from tags collected on Crescent and Foundation Islands.  Data acquired recovery of acoustic and radio tags may be sufficient to determine whether smolt travel times, migration behavior, and passage histories are associated with vulnerability to predation.  <BR><BR>Task 1.5.   The OSU shall detect the formation of new Caspian tern colonies on the Columbia Plateau and investigate colony size, habitat use, nesting success and factors limiting colony size and nesting success of incipient tern colo nies.  <BR><BR>Task 1.6.   The OSU shall asses the inter-colony movements, survival, and average age of first reproduction of Caspian terns banded at breeding colonies throughout the western United States.  The OSU will assess the relationship between mana gement related changes in the size and productivity of colonies in the Columbia River estuary and changes in recruitment and reproductive success at colonies on the Columbia Plateau.<BR><BR>Objective 2:  The OSU shall research, monitor, and evaluate predat ion on salmonid smolts by double-crested cormorants on the Columbia Plateau.<BR><BR>Task 2.1.   The OSU shall determine colony size, habitat use, nesting success, and factors limiting colony size and nesting success of the double-crested cormorant colony o n Foundation Island.  <BR><BR>Task 2.2.   The OSU shall determine diet composition and consumption of juvenile salmonids by double-crested cormorants nesting on Foundation Island.  The OSU will collect diet samples that are spontaneously regurgitated by ne sting adults and their young and by lethal sampling of adults for stomach analysis (provided permission by the USFWS).  These data will be used to determine the proportion of the diet that consist of salmonids, to estimate the total number of juvenile salm onids consumed based on calculations using a bioenergetics model, and to estimate predation rates on smolts based on numbers of juvenile salmonids available as potential prey in each migration year. <BR><BR>Task 2.3   The OSU shall determine species and st ock-specific predation rates on juvenile salmonids from the Snake and Columbia rivers by double-crested cormorants nesting on Foundation Island using two indepe ndently-derived estimates of predation.  Predation estimates will be derived from PIT tag evaluations and compared to consumptions estimates using bio-energetic modeling.  The OSU shall construct nesting platforms on Foundation Island and encourage cormora nt nesting on the platforms to enhance the ability to detect PIT tags egested by nesting cormorant colony on Foundation Island.  The OSU shall calculate PIT tag detection efficiencies on Foundation Island.<BR><BR>Task 2.4   The OSU shall determine how vari ous biotic and abiotic factors are associated with differences in smolt vulnerability to predation by Foundation Island cormorants.  Steelhead will be collected from the Smolt Monitoring Sample at Lower Monumental Dam and Ice Harbor dams April-July.  Steel head will also be collected from the Chelan County PUD - Rock Island Dam by-pass facility in May. The recorded condition of a fish will be attached to a specific tag code and vulnerability to avian predation will be evaluated using PIT tag recovery data co llected from the avian bird colonies.  The desired weekly sample is 500 fish per week from the lower Snake River and 900 per week from the mid-Columbia River.<BR>The OSU shall conduct a pilot study whereby a sub-sample of the steelhead used in this study a re screened to evaluate fish pathology and whole body chemistry as a measure of fish health.  Both lethal and non-lethal screening techniques will be investigated through collaborative work with U.C. Davis/NOAA Fisheries and USGS.  Screening will be conduc ted using established protocols.<BR>	In addition to biotic factors, OSU shall investigate how abiotic factors are associated with differences in smolt vulnerability to predation by piscivorous water birds.   OSU shall investigate abiotic factors including water temperature, inflow, outflow, spill levels, spill duration, and turbidity.  OSU will determine differences in predation rates associated with fish length, weight, condition, origin, abundance, and release date.  <BR>	OSU will continue to work collabo ratively with NOAA Fisheries to utilize existing and future telemetry data from tags collected on Crescent and Foundation Islands.  Data acquired recovery of acoustic and radio tags may be sufficient to determine whether smolt travel times, migration behav ior, and passage histories are associated with vulnerability to predation.  <BR><BR>Task 2.5   The OSU shall detect the formation of new double-crested cormorant colonies on the Columbia Plateau and investigate colony size, habitat use, nesting success, an d factors limiting nesting success of incipient cormorant colonies.  The OSU shall conduct surveys of the distribution and size of double-crested cormorant colonies on the mid-Columbia River (from the Dalles Dam to the head of Wanapum pool) and on the lowe r Snake River (from the mouth of the Clearwater River to the confluence with the Columbia River), as well as at sites off the Columbia and Snake rivers that are within foraging range of cormorants. <BR><BR>Task 2.6   The OSU shall determine the distributio n, relative abundance, and diet composition of double-crested cormorants along the mid-Columbia River and lower Snake River up to the confluence of the Clearwater River and Snake River during the post-breeding season to assess the impacts of predation by o ver-wintering cormorants on residual fall Chinook salmon.  If significant numbers of foraging cormorants are found at sites where Snake River fall Chinook smolts might be vulnerable to cormorant predation during the post-breeding season, then OSU will atte mpt to lethally collect up to 10 adult or juvenile cormorants during September-December to assess diet composition and the prevalence of fall Chinook in the diet.<BR><BR><BR>Objective 3:  The OSU shall research, monitor, and evaluate predation on salmonid smolts by other piscivorous waterbirds on the Columbia Plateau.  This objective is limited in scale and there shall not be a significant incremental cost associ ated with this objective because these data will be collected while collecting similar data outlined in objectives 1 and 2.<BR><BR>Task 3.1   The OSU shall detect PIT tags at selected gull colonies and at the Badger Island American white pelican colony as a means to evaluate relative predation rates on juvenile salmonids.  <BR><BR>Task 3.2   The OSU shall determine species and stock-specific (where feasible) predation rates on juvenile salmonids from the Snake and Columbia rivers by other piscivorous waterb ird colonies on the Columbia Plateau.  Following the nesting season, PIT tags will be recovered from study plots and PIT tag detection efficiencies will be calculated.<BR><BR>Task 3.3   The OSU shall investigate how various biotic and abiotic factors are a ssociated with differences in smolt vulnerability to other avian predators nesting on the Columbia Plateau.  The same methods and analytical approach described in Task 1.4 will be used for other species of piscivorous waterbirds (i.e. select gulls and the Badger Island American white pelican colony).   <BR><BR>     b.

<CONTACT>MS. STACY MCATEE, 812-854-1988
<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website located at http://www.fbo.gov, the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) website located at https://www.neco.navy.mil/, and the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Acquisition website located at http://www.crane.navy.mil/acquisition/synopcom.htm.  FBO is the primary point of entry to be used when access to synopses and solicitations from the World Wide Web is required.  However, the NECO webpage as well as the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Acquisition webpage serve as alternatives if the FBO website is unavailable. AMMENDMENT 0001 PURPOSE AND BACKGROUND:  Announcement N00164-07-R-4831 was released to determine potential sources for a Weapon Shot Counter (WSC) compatible with the Special Forces Combat Assault Rifle (SCAR) family of weapons.  Very limited requirements were presented in the announcement.  The purpose of this announcement is to expand upon those requirements for the WSC-SCAR and develop dialogue with industry and academia to refine those requirements.       OBJECTIVE:  The objective of this announcement is to release a draft performance specification for WSC-SCAR with the intent to elicit comment from industry and academia to help further shape the specification before solicitation.  The Closing Date for receipt of comments on the draft WSC-SCAR performance specification is Friday, 29 February 2008.   PRE-SOLICITATION CONFERENCE:  To further enhance communication between industry and Government, NSWC Crane will be holding a pre-solicitation conference.  This pre-solicitation conference is tentatively planned to be held in March 2008 at NSWC Crane, Indiana.  Blocks of time will be reserved for individual vendors, allowing for greater clarification of requirements and verbal communication of issues.  Discussions will include requirement background information, technology readiness, and questions and answers.  Attendees must register for this conference with the Contracting Officer no later than Friday, 29 February 2008.  No additional attendees will be accepted for this conference after Friday, 29 February 2008, in order to accommodate the arrangements at the conference site.  Specific time and date of the conference will be available before the close of this announcement.         PARTICIPATION:  This announcement is a public invitation.  Failure to participate in the pre-solicitation conference or provide written feedback to the draft performance specification will not preclude abstaining vendors from bidding on possible future solicitations.  This announcement is part of the full-, free-, and open- competition process, which encourages industry and academia to help shape Government specifications to match what is possible, affordable, and timely.  Failure to participate in this open pre-solicitation conference or to provide written feedback may result in a future Government performance specification over which the abstaining vendors have limited influence in the acquisition process, and may deprive abstaining vendors of potentially valuable direct early interaction with contracting officials and acquisition planners. ADDITIONAL NOTES:  It should be noted that during the course of this acquisition program, the Government plans to utilize employees from Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), Weapons System Technology Integration Center (WSTIAC), Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH), and other direct Government contractors as advisors to the Government participants.   This announcement does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Quote (RFQ), or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the Government to issue a formal solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  The U. S. Government is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse any companies or entities that respond to this announcement.  Any costs incurred by interested companies in response to this announcement will NOT be reimbursed.  Any information provided that is marked as proprietary information will be safeguarded to prevent disclosures to non-government personnel and entities.  Your interest is this program is appreciated. Questions should be directed to Ms. Stacy McAtee, Contracting Officer, Code 0562NS, telephone 812-854-1988, fax 812-854-5095, e-mail stacy.mcatee@navy.mil.

<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-301-757-3073
<RESPDATE>120707
<CONTACT>Gregory Lee, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 757-9056, Fax 301-757-2526, Email gregory.lee@navy.mil
<DESC>Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) is seeking sources to perform Organizational Level Maintenance in support of the Marine Corps RESET Project.  Support is required for the following Marine Corps Aircraft: AV-8B, FA-18A+/C/D, EA-6B, C-130J, AH-1W/Z, UH-1N/Y, CH-46E, CH-53D/E and MV-22.  Support will be required both inside and outside the Continental United States (CONUS) at the following locations: Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Camp Pendleton, CA; MCAS Miramar, CA; MCAS Yuma, AZ; MCAS Cherry Point, NC; MCAS New River, SC; MCAS Beaufort, SC; MCAS Kaneohe, HI; MCAS Futenma, Okinawa Japan; Al Asad, Iraq.  Services may also be required at other OCONUS locations in support of the Global War on Terror (GWOT).

The primary goal of the Marine Corps RESET Project is to maintain each of the aircraft identified above in its optimal material condition.  In order to achieve this goal, the RESET Project will employ a special program of Conditional Inspections and Phased Maintenance which will include inspection, cleaning, corrosion treatment, servicing, disassembly, reassembly, repair and select mandatory replacement of parts.  This program will feature three distinct RESET events for each aircraft:

(1) A PRESET, which will be performed on all aircraft leaving for the Global War on Terror (GWOT), in order to establish the material condition of the aircraft at an optimal level prior to deployment;
(2) A RECONSTITUTION, which will be performed on all aircraft returning from the GWOT, in order to re-establish the material condition of the aircraft at an optimal level; 
(3) IN THEATRE SUSTAINMENT which will be performed as needed on all deployed Aircraft in GWOT operations, in order to maintain the material condition of the aircraft at the level that was established during the PRESET.

These events will be performed according to a set schedule, although some variability in this schedule is expected because of the exigencies of the battlefield and the needs of the operational units in question.

A secondary goal of the RESET Project is for the contractor to reduce the maintenance burden on Organizational Level Marines by performing general Organizational Level Maintenance when not engaged in activities to support the RESET events outlined above.

The Government anticipates releasing a single solicitation from which multiple IDIQ contracts will be awarded.  Requirements in the solicitation will be divided on an aircraft platform by aircraft platform basis.  The Government may award as few as one (1) or as many as nine (9) contracts and anticipates that portions of this requirement will be subject to Full and Open Competition, and small business and 8(a) competitions only.  The Government anticipates that this effort shall be awarded on a predominantly Fixed Price Incentive Firm (FPIF) basis, though the contract shall contain some Cost-Plus or Time and Material elements to address the secondary goal outlined above.  The Government will make final decisions on the set-asides based on market research and responses from this Request for Information (RFI), as well as other procurement and program related criteria.

Interested parties are requested to provide information on their ability to satisfy any or all of the requirements outlined above.  Information should be provided by electronic mail to Mr. Gregory Lee at gregory.lee@navy.mil, with a copy to Ms. Rita Pegg at rita.pegg@navy.mil.  At a minimum, responses should include company name, size of business, point of contact (including telephone number, facsimile number and e-mail address), and a list of contracts within the past five (5) years under which the interested party has performed the same or similar work.  The deadline for submission of information is 7 Dec 07 at 2:30 pm.  This information is being requested for purposes of market research.  The Government will use this information to develop a list of potential bidders which will be published at a later date.

Questions concerning this notice should be submitted to Mr. Gregory Lee with a copy to Ms. Rita Pegg at the email addresses cited above.  Telephone requests for information WILL NOT be accepted.

AMENDMENT 1: THE GOVERNMENT SHALL POST ANSWERS TO ANY QUESTIONS RECEIVED IN RESPONSE TO THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ON FEDBIZOPS BY 2:30 PM, 14 DEC 07.

<DESC>***  Updated Information
***  Added 29 January 2008

It has been brought to our attention here at NAWCTSD that access to the www.gcss-af.com webpage is problematic in some instances. As such, the following documents have been attached to this posting: 

  - RSOHeavy_MigrationGuide.doc
  - GCSS VDD 28Jan08.xls

These documents provide the necessary background to fulfill the purposes of this request for information.

Note: The government would ideally desire that the only software running outside the browser would be on the server side. However, the government is interested in other approaches as long as they do not require installation of software on the client machine that requires accreditation through AF SDC or Navy Gold Disk.

Also, it has been brought to our attention that we abbreviated Megabyte as mb (which would be megabit) when it should have shown as MB.  That happens only twice in the document--in paragraph A.3.

***  End Update




The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD), in support of the Air Force and the Navy, is considering development of a competitive acquisition strategy to provide United States armed forces personnel the capability to participate in massive multi-user, first-person perspective mission rehearsal for combat convoy missions over the web, using Internet Explorer as the client software.  The target implementation environment is Global Combat Support System (GCSS) and will be initially deployed on GCSS-Air Force (GCSS-AF).

The United States armed forces is interested in acquiring CCMRT to provide skills retention/enhancement training of all mission critical tasks/tactics, techniques, & procedures (TTP)/doctrine related to convoy operations, available to all military personnel over the services' portals (using GCSS).  The Air Staff plans to establish a 24/7 server cluster within the Air Force network, which will host the system and provide interoperability and connectivity with other simulations and training systems.  The software must be modular and provide tools for user community modification of scenarios, heuristics, evaluation criteria, and asset data (art, behavior, and physics/ballistics data for maps, terrain, structures, avatars, vehicles, equipment, weapons, etc).   The goal is to build upon the framework used for this system to provide mission rehearsal or simulation capability for any Agile Combat Support role performed in the first-person, starting with a prototype combat convoy mission rehearsal tool as the initial application on the framework, with full GCSS-AF integration (Level IV), and with complete editing and intelligent tutoring capabilities.  This begins with producing a proof of concept that can utilize a current standard Air Force computer as a web-server within a base's enclave (domain) to run the simulation for a limited number of clients within the enclave and include limited editing tools.  The proof of concept must also be used on the GCSS-AF test range to assess GCSS-AF and typical Air Force NIPERNET lag/latency/bandwidth constraints and demonstrate the concept through the Air Force Portal.  This approach is designed to build full capability while delivering interim capabilities to users parallel to the development of advanced capabilities and for the certification and accreditation process.  


The four individual elements of the CCMRT are as follows:  

a.  Web client user application:   

a.1.  Functionally, the client will provide the user a full-screen, first-person perspective simulation of dismounted and mounted operations for mission execution (similar to a first-person shooter game), yet also have capability to use simulated maps, briefing aids, and other mission planning and after action review tools in the third-person.  It will allow users to control simulated equipment ranging from vehicles, weapons, computers, communications/radios, blue force trackers, and ISR feeds.  It will allow users to perform any role in a convoy team and switch roles on the fly, if necessary, and also allow users to perform roles of neutral civilians and enemy forces.  Ideally, it will allow users to communicate with each other by voice, realistically simulating physical proximity, intercoms, and radios.  Initially an alternate, simplified communication method will be required to capture graded events, until the software can assess user performance by interpreting the speech recognition data.  The client will be scalable all the way from a single human participant operating with, against, and being evaluated by the computer, up to large teams operating with each other and training against human-controlled entities, and evaluated by humans.  It must produce an engaging experience; the user-interface must allow real-time completion of required tasks.  The default sequence of events will be mission planning, mission execution, and after action review.

a.2.  Technically, the client user application must operate in a military enterprise computing environment and be executable by users with minimal or no support required from Information Technology support staffs (personnel with admin rights on the local machine).  It must meet DoD and service requirements for accreditation and certification, as well as be compatible with restraints such as Air Force Standard Desktop Configuration compliance.  The client will provide an interface between the user, the server, and other users.  It will render 3-D graphics and stereo audio, perform physics modeling for moving entities, collect user inputs from the keyboard, mouse, and microphone, and relay to the server.   A mixture of 2-D and 3-D graphics can be used (i.e., vehicle interiors can be represented in a 2-D 360 degree panorama (with a different vantage point for each position in the vehicle), while exteriors are viewed through the vehicle windows in 3-D.  Client will store simulation engine coding, physics models, and terrain/entity artwork and characteristics on the local machine.  A modular approach will be used so that this data may be updated automatically each log-in or as required.  Essentially, this node will serve as a graphics engine and communications interface.  It will rely on the server to relay state data on the other entities, and will render the appropriate graphics according to the user's perspective (i.e., display entities within visual line-of sight of the user).  It should take no longer than 30 minutes to perform initial execution of mobile code and data, assuming a 100kb/s or better connection.  Code and data should persist on local machine and be accessible to all users so subsequent execution should take no more than 5 minutes for any user on that machine.

a.3.  Client user application minimum computer requirements:  Client software will be Air Force Standard Desktop Configuration (SDC)-compliant and ideally will require minimal or no administrator support for initial setup and no administrator support for content updates.  Graphics will run at a minimum resolution of 800 x 600 (extrapolated to full screen mode) with at least a 20 FPS refresh rate.  Minimum client software/hardware requirements are Windows XP SP2, DirectX 9, Internet Explorer 6 (but forward compatible to Vista, DirectX 10, and Internet Explorer 7) running on at least a Pentium iii 1.0ghz with on board 3-D graphics, 16MB dedicated or shared video RAM and 256MB system RAM.  A low-cost headset may be required if the client machine lacks adequate built-in 2-way audio.   Client will require broadband connection.  Users will authenticate with their DoD Common Access Cards (CAC) using the Air Force Portal/GCSS-AF's  Reduced Sign On (RSO) function.  Further digital encryption only required for transfer of user metrics.

b.  Web client instructor/editor application.  

b.1.  Functionally, the client instructor/editor application will allow a human instructor to track the execution of a scenario and monitor activities through a scalable perspective ranging from a 2-D bird's eye view of everything happening, down to the actions of any particular user.  It will also allow him to assemble an after action review and present it to the users online.  The instructor/editor application will also provide a highly intuitive, powerful suite of editing tools.  These tools must empower trusted Air Force military, civilian, and/or contracted personnel with intermediate computer skills to modify existing (or produce new) scenarios, terrain/entities artwork and characteristics (including physics, AI behaviors, etc.).  It will also allow them to modify heuristics, training criteria, doctrine/TTP models, the Intelligent Tutor model (assessment criteria), and import multimedia.  It will have direct read access to static databases and have the ability to push limited edits directly to selected users on a per-session basis, and/or push edits to a holding area on the server for possible global release by the CCMRT program office.   The program office would also use this application for initial creation of scenarios and assets.

b.2.  Technically, the client instructor/editor application will mirror the constraints of the user application (see paragraph a.2).

b.3.  Client instructor/editor application minimum computer requirements will mirror the constraints of the user application (see paragraph a.3).

c.  Dynamic Server cluster.  

c.1.  Functionally, the dynamic server cluster will require the following capabilities: Execute multiple simultaneous simulation sessions (control the simulation for the clients and perform the resource-intensive operations).  Ability to provide Scenario Control, Behavior Control, Data Collection (user training/performance metrics), Speech Recognition, Assessment (intelligent tutoring/coaching), Feedback (robust automated after action review with team and individual performance assessment), VOIP Hub, Communications (DIS/HLA/SCORM) to allow interoperability with other simulations and learning management systems.  The server will include a website on the Air Force Portal to serve as a "lobby" to schedule sessions, for trainers and supervisors to access detailed user metrics, and to post a "scoreboard" so users can see where they stand with an aggregated, cumulative "score".  

c.2.  Technically, the dynamic server cluster will reside within the GCSS-AF server farm.  It must work around challenges such as lag and latency within the Air Force NIPRNET.  All communications will travel through this hub and spoke topography, there will be no peer-to-peer communications.  System must have capability for constant 2-way data transmission  without incurring lags caused by starting and stopping connections.  User training/performance metrics will require a managed access control scheme to allow only the appropriate supervisors and trainers to view (and export to Excel) users' metrics.  This data must be protected with 128-bit encryption.

c.3.   Dynamic server cluster computer requirements.  Server-side software and hardware must comply with all GCSS-AF level-4 compliance requirements, to include architecture, information assurance accreditation, etc.  See www.gcss-af.com for details.
 
d.  Static data servers.  Data that stays relatively static will be distributed geographically on the ?Edge? using GCSS-AF Akamai edge server technology to speed downloads.  

d.2.  Technically, the static data servers will reside on GCSS-AF Akamai edge servers distributed throughout the Air Force Enterprise.  They will synchronize new content at least daily.

d.3.   Static server cluster computer requirements.  Server-side software and hardware must comply with all GCSS-AF level-4 compliance requirements, to include architecture, information assurance accreditation, etc.  See www.gcss-af.com for details.

Air Staff is interested in several categories of possible solutions for client-side delivery:

a. Browser plug-ins already included in Standard Desktop Configuration (SDC) image, e.g., Flash Player 9.0.45.0, Shockwave Player 10.2.0.023, Windows Presentation Framework.

b. ActiveX controls (packaged for SMS installation) to execute DirectX (may be written in XNA, if technically possible).

c. Java (not java script).

d. Browser plug-ins not already included in Standard Desktop Configuration (SDC) image.

Air Staff may direct that the software emulate specific functionality of existing simulations and editing tools for inclusion in the prototype and production development.  Additionally, Air Staff may direct the re-use of existing government-owned asset data.  If so, these requirements will be identified in the statement of work and be contingent on government access to the code.  Once identified, these requirements should not change.

Air Staff prefers to purchase an open source solution, maximizing use of open source licensing models.  A mixture of open source and proprietary modules may be necessary, but licensing for the proprietary modules must not be cost-prohibitive against providing web-based access to all users across the Air Force enterprise.  

Air Staff will provide access to combat convoy subject matter experts.

Interested parties should provide a written statement of capability, using the prescribed format (font size 11, Times New Roman); not to exceed ten (10) pages (including cover page), addressing the following:

a.  General capabilities and experience in providing similar simulation systems.

b.  Identification of projected delivery date for proof of concept phase, to include alpha, beta, and code complete versions.

c.  Specific capabilities and experience with thin client/mobile code 3-D graphics, physics modeling (human, vehicles, ballistics, flight), entity artificial intelligence, speech recognition/evaluation, instructor operator stations, machinima, scenario generation, after action review, collective training and concurrency, intelligent tutoring/coaching.

d.  Subcontract management experience and potential teaming arrangements, if any.

e.  Licensing options.

f.  Include the company name, cage code, large or small business and primary point of contact including email address and telephone number.  

g.  It is most critical to provide an alpha release demo within 60 days after contract award and final release of the proof of concept at the earliest possible date. Please address your capability to author software in the most expeditious manner possible and include projected/estimated production time from contract award to first delivery.

<DESC>***  Updated Information
***  Added 28 January 2008

It has been brought to our attention here at NAWCTSD that access to the www.gcss-af.com webpage is problematic in some instances. As such, the following documents have been attached to this posting: 

  - RSOHeavy_MigrationGuide.doc
  - GCSS VDD 28Jan08.xls

These documents provide the necessary background to fulfill the purposes of this request for information.

Note: The government would ideally desire that the only software running outside the browser would be on the server side. However, the government is interested in other approaches as long as they do not require installation of software on the client machine that requires accreditation through AF SDC or Navy Gold Disk.

Also, it has been brought to our attention that we abbreviated Megabyte as mb (which would be megabit) when it should have shown as MB.  That happens only twice in the document--in paragraph A.3.

The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD), in support of the Air Force and the Navy, is considering development of a competitive acquisition strategy to provide United States armed forces personnel the capability to participate in massive multi-user, first-person perspective mission rehearsal for combat convoy missions over the web, using Internet Explorer as the client software.  The target implementation environment is Global Combat Support System (GCSS) and will be initially deployed on GCSS-Air Force (GCSS-AF).

The United States armed forces is interested in acquiring CCMRT to provide skills retention/enhancement training of all mission critical tasks/tactics, techniques, & procedures (TTP)/doctrine related to convoy operations, available to all military personnel over the services' portals (using GCSS).  The Air Staff plans to establish a 24/7 server cluster within the Air Force network, which will host the system and provide interoperability and connectivity with other simulations and training systems.  The software must be modular and provide tools for user community modification of scenarios, heuristics, evaluation criteria, and asset data (art, behavior, and physics/ballistics data for maps, terrain, structures, avatars, vehicles, equipment, weapons, etc).   The goal is to build upon the framework used for this system to provide mission rehearsal or simulation capability for any Agile Combat Support role performed in the first-person, starting with a prototype combat convoy mission rehearsal tool as the initial application on the framework, with full GCSS-AF integration (Level IV), and with complete editing and intelligent tutoring capabilities.  This begins with producing a proof of concept that can utilize a current standard Air Force computer as a web-server within a base's enclave (domain) to run the simulation for a limited number of clients within the enclave and include limited editing tools.  The proof of concept must also be used on the GCSS-AF test range to assess GCSS-AF and typical Air Force NIPERNET lag/latency/bandwidth constraints and demonstrate the concept through the Air Force Portal.  This approach is designed to build full capability while delivering interim capabilities to users parallel to the development of advanced capabilities and for the certification and accreditation process.  


The four individual elements of the CCMRT are as follows:  

a.  Web client user application:   

a.1.  Functionally, the client will provide the user a full-screen, first-person perspective simulation of dismounted and mounted operations for mission execution (similar to a first-person shooter game), yet also have capability to use simulated maps, briefing aids, and other mission planning and after action review tools in the third-person.  It will allow users to control simulated equipment ranging from vehicles, weapons, computers, communications/radios, blue force trackers, and ISR feeds.  It will allow users to perform any ram and switch roles on the fly, if necessary, and also allow users to perform roles of neutral civilians and enemy forces.  Ideally, it will allow users to communicate with each other by voice, realistically simulating physical proximity, intercoms, and radios.  Initially an alternate, simplified communication method will be required to capture graded events, until the software can assess user performance by interpreting the speech recognition data.  The client will be scalable all the way from a single human participant operating with, against, and being evaluated by the computer, up to large teams operating with each other and training against human-controlled entities, and evaluated by humans.  It must produce an engaging experience; the user-interface must allow real-time completion of required tasks.  The default sequence of events will be mission planning, mission execution, and after action review.

a.2.  Technically, the client user application must operate in a military enterprise computing environment and be executable by users with minimal or no support required from Information Technology support staffs (personnel with admin rights on the local machine).  It must meet DoD and service requirements for accreditation and certification, as well as be compatible with restraints such as Air Force Standard Desktop Configuration compliance.  The client will provide an interface between the user, the server, and other users.  It will render 3-D graphics and stereo audio, perform physics modeling for moving entities, collect user inputs from the keyboard, mouse, and microphone, and relay to the server.   A mixture of 2-D and 3-D graphics can be used (i.e., vehicle interiors can be represented in a 2-D 360 degree panorama (with a different vantage point for each position in the vehicle), while exteriors are viewed through the vehicle windows in 3-D.  Client will store simulation engine coding, physics models, and terrain/entity artwork and characteristics on the local machine.  A modular approach will be used so that this data may be updated automatically each log-in or as required.  Essentially, this node will serve as a graphics engine and communications interface.  It will rely on the server to relay state data on the other entities, and will render the appropriate graphics according to the user's perspective (i.e., display entities within visual line-of sight of the user).  It should take no longer than 30 minutes to perform initial execution of mobile code and data, assuming a 100kb/s or better connection.  Code and data should persist on local machine and be accessible to all users so subsequent execution should take no more than 5 minutes for any user on that machine.

a.3.  Client user application minimum computer requirements:  Client software will be Air Force Standard Desktop Configuration (SDC)-compliant and ideally will require minimal or no administrator support for initial setup and no administrator support for content updates.  Graphics will run at a minimum resolution of 800 x 600 (extrapolated to full screen mode) with at least a 20 FPS refresh rate.  Minimum client software/hardware requirements are Windows XP SP2, DirectX 9, Internet Explorer 6 (but forward compatible to Vista, DirectX 10, and Internet Explorer 7) running on at least a Pentium iii 1.0ghz with on board 3-D graphics, 16MB dedicated or shared video RAM and 256MB system RAM.  A low-cost headset may be required if the client machine lacks adequate built-in 2-way audio.   Client will require broadband connection.  Users will authenticate with their DoD Common Access Cards (CAC) using the Air Force Portal/GCSS-AF's  Reduced Sign On (RSO) function.  Further digital encryption only required for transfer of user metrics.

b.  Web client instructor/editor application.  

b.1.  Functionally, the client instructor/editor application will allow a human instructor to track the execution of a scenario and monitor activities through a scalable perspective ranging from a 2-D bird's eye view of everything happening, down to the actions of any particular user.  It will also allow him to assemble an after action review and present it to the users online.  The instructor/editor application will also provide a highly intuitive, powerful suite of editing tools.  These tools must empower trusted Air Force military, civilian, and/or contracted personnel with intermediate computer skills to modify existing (or produce new) scenarios, terrain/entities artwork and characteristics (including physics, AI behaviors, etc.).  It will also allow them to modify heuristics, training criteria, doctrine/TTP models, the Intelligent Tutor model (assessment criteria), and import multimedia.  It will have direct read access to static databases and have the ability to push limited edits directly to selected users on a per-session basis, and/or push edits to a holding area on the server for possible global release by the CCMRT program office.   The program office would also use this application for initial creation of scenarios and assets.

b.2.  Technically, the client instructor/editor application will mirror the constraints of the user application (see paragraph a.2).

b.3.  Client instructor/editor application minimum computer requirements will mirror the constraints of the user application (see paragraph a.3).

c.  Dynamic Server cluster.  

c.1.  Functionally, the dynamic server cluster will require the following capabilities: Execute multiple simultaneous simulation sessions (control the simulation for the clients and perform the resource-intensive operations).  Ability to provide Scenario Control, Behavior Control, Data Collection (user training/performance metrics), Speech Recognition, Assessment (intelligent tutoring/coaching), Feedback (robust automated after action review with team and individual performance assessment), VOIP Hub, Communications (DIS/HLA/SCORM) to allow interoperability with other simulations and learning management systems.  The server will include a website on the Air Force Portal to serve as a "lobby" to schedule sessions, for trainers and supervisors to access detailed user metrics, and to post a "scoreboard" so users can see where they stand with an aggregated, cumulative "score".  

c.2.  Technically, the dynamic server cluster will reside within the GCSS-AF server farm.  It must work around challenges such as lag and latency within the Air Force NIPRNET.  All communications will travel through this hub and spoke topography, there will be no peer-to-peer communications.  System must have capability for constant 2-way data transmission  without incurring lags caused by starting and stopping connections.  User training/performance metrics will require a managed access control scheme to allow only the appropriate supervisors and trainers to view (and export to Excel) users' metrics.  This data must be protected with 128-bit encryption.

c.3.   Dynamic server cluster computer requirements.  Server-side software and hardware must comply with all GCSS-AF level-4 compliance requirements, to include architecture, information assurance accreditation, etc.  See www.gcss-af.com for details.
 
d.  Static data servers.  Data that stays relatively static will be distributed geographically on the ?Edge? using GCSS-AF Akamai edge server technology to speed downloads.  

d.2.  Technically, the static data servers will reside on GCSS-AF Akamai edge servers distributed throughout the Air Force Enterprise.  They will synchronize new content at least daily.

d.3.   Static server cluster computer requirements.  Server-side software and hardware must comply with all GCSS-AF level-4 compliance requirements, to include architecture, information assurance accreditation, etc.  See www.gcss-af.com for details.

Air Staff is interested in several categories of possible solutions for client-side delivery:

a. Browser plug-ins already included in Standard Desktop Configuration (SDC) image, e.g., Flash Player 9.0.45.0, Shockwave Player 10.2.0.023, Windows Presentation Framework.

b. ActiveX controls (packaged for SMS installation) to execute DirectX (may be written in XNA, if technically possible).

c. Java (not java script).

d. Browser plug-ins not already included in Standard Desktop Configuration (SDC) image.

Air Staff may direct that the software emulate specific functionality of existing simulations and editing tools for inclusion in the prototype and production development.  Additionally, Air Staff may direct the re-use of existing government-owned asset data.  If so, these requirements will be identified in the statement of work and be contingent on government access to the code.  Once identified, these requirements should not change.

Air Staff prefers to purchase an open source solution, maximizing use of open source licensing models.  A mixture of open source and proprietary modules may be necessary, but licensing for the proprietary modules must not be cost-prohibitive against providing web-based access to all users across the Air Force enterprise.  

Air Staff will provide access to combat convoy subject matter experts.

Interested parties should provide a written statement of capability, using the prescribed format (font size 11, Times New Roman); not to exceed ten (10) pages (including cover page), addressing the following:

a.  General capabilities and experience in providing similar simulation systems.

b.  Identification of projected delivery date for proof of concept phase, to include alpha, beta, and code complete versions.

c.  Specific capabilities and experience with thin client/mobile code 3-D graphics, physics modeling (human, vehicles, ballistics, flight), entity artificial intelligence, speech recognition/evaluation, instructor operator stations, machinima, scenario generation, after action review, collective training and concurrency, intelligent tutoring/coaching.

d.  Subcontract management experience and potential teaming arrangements, if any.

e.  Licensing options.

f.  Include the company name, cage code, large or small business and primary point of contact including email address and telephone number.  

g.  It is most critical to provide an alpha release demo within 60 days after contract award and final release of the proof of concept at the earliest possible date. Please address your capability to author software in the most expeditious manner possible and include projected/estimated production time from contract award to first delivery.

Written statement of capabilities should be received by this office NLT COB 04 February 08.

<DESC>This Is A Sources Sought Announcement Only For Purposes Of Conducting <BR>Market Research.     There Is No Solicitation Available At This Time.     Requests For A Solicitation Will Not Receive A Response.     The U. S. Army Natick Soldier <BR>Researc h, Development and Engineering Center is conducting market research to <BR>determine the existence of sources, to include small businesses, that are capable of providing a commercial off the shelf (COTS) personal portable water purification <BR>system.  <BR><BR>This personal portable water purification system is intended for use in emergency <BR>domestic applications, not military applications.   The desired system should be a simple approach where contaminated water is transformed into potable water, <B R>with minimal human involvement.  Gravity feed filtering or ultra-violet (UV) <BR>disinfection systems are desirable. Systems that require pumping or the use of a <BR>chemical disinfectant are not sought.     <BR><BR>The system must be capable of filterin g and/o r treating contaminated water in <BR>accordance with criteria established by the Environmental Protection Agency <BR>(EPA) National Drinking Water Standards (NDWS).  Specifically, the <BR>contaminants that must be removed or treated are:<BR>1.   Cryptosporidium <BR>2.       Giardia<BR>3.       Human enteric viruses<BR>4.       Coliform bacteria<BR>5.       Turbidity<BR>Removal or remediation of other EPA NDWS contaminants is desired but not <BR>required. Other contaminants that are desired but n ot required to be removed or <BR>trea ted include organic chemicals, such as insecticides, herbicides, #6 fuel oil, <BR>polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and inorganic chemicals, such as arsenic and <BR>lead.         <BR><BR>Respondents to this sources soug ht request shall submit: <BR>1. A physical description of their water purification system.<BR>2. Documented test data of their water purification systems performance in <BR>accordance with recognized water purification standards (i.e. NSF 53 or P248).<BR> 3. The lifecycle purification capacity of t heir system (in liters).<BR>4. The purification rate of their system (in liters per hour).<BR>5. The shelf life of their system (in months).<BR>6. The packaging data of their system (units per pallet, cubic volum e and weight <BR>of pallet).<BR>7. The curre nt Manufactured Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) and the wholesale <BR>cost of their item (in quantity).<BR><BR>The desired objective is for a system that does not require the user to add a <BR>chemical disinfectan t. However, any business concern that offers a COTS system <BR>that currently meets most but not all the personal portable water purification <BR>system requirements is encouraged to submit a proposed product improvement <BR>plan for achieving all desired system performance requirements.  For instance, if <BR>their current filter system requires the addition of a chemical disinfectant to <BR>remediate viruses, they can submit their current COTS product and a proposed <BR>product improvement plan that would eliminate the need to add a chemical <BR>dis infectant to remediate viruses.<BR><BR>The Government will not reimburse any business concern for any information <BR>submitted in response to this sources sought request.  Submission of information <BR>or sampl es submitted is voluntary.  Any proprietary information will be held <BR>confidential. Business concerns submitting responses should indicate whether <BR>they are large, small, small disadvantaged, 8(a), HUBZone or service disabled <BR>veteran owned small business.         <BR><BR>The information provided in response to this sources sought announcement will <BR>be used to develop the acquisition strategy for this requirement. Should an <BR>acquisition eventually occur, this solicitation will not be conducte d by the Army <BR>or the Federal government. Large business concerns are not prohibited from <BR>responding to this announcement.     <BR><BR>All interested bus iness concerns are required to respond to this sou rces sought <BR>announcement via email no later than 29 February 2008, 2:00 p.m. <BR>EDT.

The review process assesses the state's management practices and program implementation of the FTA funded transit programs such as Section 5309, Section 5310, Section 5311, Section 5316, and Section 5317 programs, to include the Rural Transit Assistance Program (RTAP) and other related FTA funded transportation programs to ensure that they are being administered in accordance with specific FTA requirements.  In performing assignments related to the state management review process, the contractors will be required to apply expert technical knowledge and experience to provide review of the following 19 Federal transit program requirements.

1.	Program Management
2.	Grants Administration

Background:  The Pentagon Memorial, under construction outside the Pentagon, is a newly constructed site dedicated to the 184 victims of the 9/11 attack on the Pentagon with a scheduled completion on or about August/September 2008.  The focus of the Pentagon Memorial park is the one-hundred and eighty-four memorial units. Each unit is dedicated to an individual victim.  The field of memorial units is arranged as a timeline of the victim's ages, from 3 to 71. The western edge of the site is defined with an "age wall" that grows an inch in height relative to the age represented by the rows of memorial units.  The memorial includes formal landscaping.

Requirement:  (Note: The description herein is a summary of the required services and is not intended to be all-inclusive).  

Description of Services 

1. Overview.  The contract encompasses all activities associated with the operation and maintenance, including repairs, of the two acre Pentagon Memorial.  Attachment J-C2 provides a list of the Pentagon Memorial equipment and systems to be maintained under this contract.  The inventory is illustrative of the types of equipment and systems to be maintained under this contract.  During the life of the contract, individual pieces of equipment or complete systems may be replaced.  The Contractor shall maintain the replacement equipment and systems.  Changes to the inventory will not result in a change to the contract.  The Pentagon Memorial is a unique structure serving as a work of art, a memorial of significant emotional power, and a functioning park with landscaping and moving water features.  Each of these aspects presents major challenges to the performance of this contract.  In combination, they require considerable orchestration of contractor resources coupled with a deep sensitivity to the significance of the memorial and the concerns of victims? families and the general public.  
2. Mechanical and electrical system maintenance.  The most visible Memorial systems, and consequently those requiring the most intensive management, are the water pump and ancillary components that assure water flow through the individual memorial unit pools and the Memorial illumination system.  
3. Aesthetics.  The nature of the work required to maintain Memorial cleanliness and orderliness are well with the abilities of the typical laborer.  Principle duties are keeping the area free of litter, raking the gravel areas to ensure smoothness, removal of gravel from unit pools, polishing metal surfaces, cleaning stone faces, and assuring the pools remain clear.  However, again, the sheer size, number, and physical arrangement of these areas present a supervisory and quality control challenge.  Maintaining a 'pristine' appearance of the Memorial presents the most immediate and continuous contractor objective.  The contractor effort is further complicated by the requirement to honor the privacy of visitors to the memorial.  To that end, while considerable effort must be on-going, it must be accomplished in as unobtrusive manner as possible.  Therefore, the contractor must balance the urgent requirement to perform maintenance, repair, and cleaning tasks with the equal need to maintain the lowest possible profile so as not to disturb the solemnity visitors to the site.  It goes without saying that the conduct of the workforce must be ever mindful of the emotional significance of the Memorial and the sensitivity of visitors, especially family members.
4. Landscaping.  The Memorial contract also requires the skills of the landscaping trades.  Each item of landscaping was selected and placed to enhance the overall design of the Memorial.  For example, there are 86 Paper Bark Maples trees of varying size.  The contract requires the landscaping esthetics be preserved through routine landscaping maintenance activities and replacements as required.  Landscaping is also an integral part of the structural boundary walls.  The landscaping responsibilities include: irrigation of all landscaped areas; irrigation system maintenance/repair; soil analysis, remediation and maintenance of soil chemistry; complete maintenance of all turf areas including mowing, edging, and fertilizing; tree maintenance, pruning, fertilizing and new tree planting; dead tree removal; complete plant bed maintenance including new planting, plant replacement, pruning, trimming, weeding, mulching, and fertilizing; and exterior pest and weed control
5. Pool Water Treatment System.  The most important aspect of the 184 'fountains' requiring the most intensive management is the water treatment system.  The treatment initiated must be one that has been specifically formulated for each system and performed by a qualified Water Treatment Specialist in compliance with Groundwater, Storm water and Fountain Systems Operation and Maintenance Manuals and the terms and conditions of the EPA National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit.
6. Cleaning precautions.  As a unique artistic structure, aspects of this Memorial require specialized maintenance and repair techniques.  Certain cleaning materials may permanently damage or mar surfaces.  The design itself will present unique maintenance and repair challenges, e.g., the large number of reflecting pools.  The cleaning and maintenance of the granite surfaces requires a professional conservator and the stainless steel surfaces require special products and techniques.  
Contractor proactive supervision of these key tasks is essential to avoid expensive damage to the Memorial.
7. Repairs.  The cost of performing minor repairs is included in the fixed price.  Minor repairs are defined as individual repairs that do not exceed $2,000.00 (labor plus materials). Major repairs and minor construction may be ordered under the indefinite quantity portion of the contract.
8. Indefinite Quantity Work.  Single repairs and minor construction from $2,001.00 to $100,000.00 may be ordered under the indefinite quantity portion of this contract.
9. Snow removal.  The contract includes snow removal at the Memorial.  Generally, this will encompass keeping pedestrian areas cleared and removal of snow from seating areas.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems command, Applied Aerodynamics and Store Separation Branch (AIR 4.3.2.1), Patuxent River, MD 20670 announces its intention to procure, on a competitive basis, the materials and services necessary for the following: upgrade of tunnel control system to a variable frequency drive, upgrade tunnel control and data acquisition computer(s) to control and acquire all existing facility instrumentation, procure and integrate a data post-processing computer(s) that will process data from all the various instruments, procure and integrate PCU (3 modules) upgrades to an PSI 8400 electronically scanned pressure system, procure and integrate a Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) system, and procure and integrate an unsteady, 5-hole, L-shaped, pressure probe system.   The procurement would include fabrication, installation, delivery, and technical support.  All interested parties are encouraged to respond, however, the Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this synopsis.  

INTRODUCTION:   

The purpose of the project is to acquire the latest model Particle Image Velocimetry system (PIV) and replace the current antiquated instrumentation computers tunnel drive system and with one or more computers to control all the instrumentation systems and wind tunnel drive. 

 Currently, three different computers using three different operating systems control various aspects of tunnel operation.  All computers are antiquated; the master control computer is a 486 PC.  The master computer experiences about 5% to 10% downtime during operation.  Upgrading the master computer is not possible as the tunnel drive/control software is incompatible with newer computers (and upgradeable software does not exist).  Additionally, all computers are operated as stand alone systems and are of limited memory and disk space.  It is becoming very difficult to single-handedly run the wind tunnel.  

The tunnel drive controller is antiquated and a failure would shut down the facility for an unacceptable length of time.  Additionally, the current drive components restrict the operating envelope to a minimum of 50 ft/s.  Low speed operation is impossible.  Wind tunnel corrections are difficult to adequately acquire due to the inability of the tunnel fan control to drive tunnel speed to 0 ft/s in a timely manner.  Test set-up, conduction, and data reduction/analysis is currently far from a turn-key operation.  Each test becomes a unique, in-efficient exercise.  Communication between the various systems is difficult at best (and with some systems impossible)

REQUIREMENTS:
The anticipated contract effort includes, but is not limited to the following:

The contractor shall be required to design, fabricate, procure, integrate, deliver, install, and provide training/support for a standardized and integrated wind tunnel control, data acquisition and post-processing system.  This system will consist of replacement of current wind tunnel drive control with a variable frequency drive/control that does not hinder, in any manner, current capability (including electronic noise levels) and is able to be remotely controlled from the facility control room, and integration of current instrumentation using standardized software to control, acquire and process data.  The contractor shall procure or manufacture a PIV system and an unsteady, 5-hole, L-shaped, pressure probe system and upgrade the PSI 8400 system PCU modules.  The contractor shall deliver, install, and insure operation of all components, and demonstrate integration of current facility instrumentation.  All computers must be able to easily pass data to each other.

The contractor shall have proven capability, compatibility, and knowledge of integrating wind tunnel control and data acquisition systems and instrumentation.

TECHNICAL QUALIFICATIONS:
The tunnel drive shall be of a low-noise, variable frequency type and able to control a 200 HP motor.  Tunnel control software/computers, henceforth referred to as the system,  must be able to control tunnel speed and acquire data from the various existing instruments.  The existing instruments are, but not limited to the following: 6-component strain gage balances with reference voltage sensing, pressure transducers, temperature probes, relative humidity probes.  Also, the system must be able to integrate, control and acquire data for an existing electronically scanned pressure system that contains approximately 200 channels of pressure data.  The system must be able to integrate, control and acquire data for an existing unsteady pressure data from a 32 channel, 100 kHz CAMAC system.  The system must be able to integrate, control and acquire data for an existing facility traverses.  The system must be able to integrate, control and acquire data for a to-be-procured PIV system.  The system must be able to integrate, control and acquire data for a to-be-procured an unsteady, 5-hole, L-shaped, pressure probe system.

The PIV system shall consist of 4 Mpixel, 14 bit cameras, 200 mJ laser and all software hardware for stereoscopic PIV measurement.  For aerosol dissemination, a six-jet Laskin nozzle aerosol generator is required.  The contractor shall provide PIV system set up and training.

The three (3) Pressure Calibration Units (PCU) modules shall be compatible with the existing PSI 8400 system and the planned procurement for the facility control/acquisition system.   

The facility control system shall use state of the art computers with adequate speed, processors, and data storage capability to control, acquire, and process data.  The system must be able to integrate the existing facility instrumentation and the planned procured instrumentation and therefore must have adequate input capabilities.  

The system software must be able to control all instruments and acquire data.  The software must be handle strain gage balance (and other instrument) functions such as tares, Rcals or check loads, and the balance interaction matrices.  The primary goal of this effort is to achieve a system that will allow for the speedy set up, control, and acquisition of wind tunnel tests in a more turn-key operation. 

The contractor shall provide initial training and reference manuals.  All technical source data will become government property. Maintenance instructions for the life preservation of components, maintenance procedures are also required where applicable.  

CHECKOUT TESTING:  The contractor shall be required to demonstrate system integration/acquisition of the existing facility instrumentation, control of the facility drive, and integration/acquisition of the procured instrumentation. 

The Contract type is anticipated to be a Firm-Fixed Price contract.  These services shall be performed at the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Maryland.  The total estimated dollar value for this procurement is roughly estimated to be $434,000.00.  The applicable NAICS code for this requirement is 541380.

<DESC>Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) is seeking sources to perform Organizational Level Maintenance in support of the Marine Corps RESET Project.  Support is required for the following Marine Corps Aircraft: AV-8B, FA-18A+/C/D, EA-6B, C-130J, AH-1W/Z, UH-1N/Y, CH-46E, CH-53D/E and MV-22.  Support will be required both inside and outside the Continental United States (CONUS) at the following locations: Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Camp Pendleton, CA; MCAS Miramar, CA; MCAS Yuma, AZ; MCAS Cherry Point, NC; MCAS New River, SC; MCAS Beaufort, SC; MCAS Kaneohe, HI; MCAS Futenma, Okinawa Japan; Al Asad, Iraq.  Services may also be required at other OCONUS locations in support of the Global War on Terror (GWOT).

The primary goal of the Marine Corps RESET Project is to maintain each of the aircraft identified above in its optimal material condition.  In order to achieve this goal, the RESET Project will employ a special program of Conditional Inspections and Phased Maintenance which will include inspection, cleaning, corrosion treatment, servicing, disassembly, reassembly, repair and select mandatory replacement of parts.  This program will feature three distinct RESET events for each aircraft:

(1) A PRESET, which will be performed on all aircraft leaving for the Global War on Terror (GWOT), in order to establish the material condition of the aircraft at an optimal level prior to deployment;
(2) A RECONSTITUTION, which will be performed on all aircraft returning from the GWOT, in order to re-establish the material condition of the aircraft at an optimal level; 
(3) IN THEATRE SUSTAINMENT which will be performed as needed on all deployed Aircraft in GWOT operations, in order to maintain the material condition of the aircraft at the level that was established during the PRESET.

These events will be performed according to a set schedule, although some variability in this schedule is expected because of the exigencies of the battlefield and the needs of the operational units in question.

A secondary goal of the RESET Project is for the contractor to reduce the maintenance burden on Organizational Level Marines by performing general Organizational Level Maintenance when not engaged in activities to support the RESET events outlined above.

The Government anticipates releasing a single solicitation from which multiple IDIQ contracts will be awarded.  Requirements in the solicitation will be divided on an aircraft platform by aircraft platform basis.  The Government may award as few as one (1) or as many as nine (9) contracts and anticipates that portions of this requirement will be subject to Full and Open Competition, and small business and 8(a) competitions only.  The Government anticipates that this effort shall be awarded on a predominantly Fixed Price Incentive Firm (FPIF) basis, though the contract shall contain some Cost-Plus or Time and Material elements to address the secondary goal outlined above.  The Government will make final decisions on the set-asides based on market research and responses from this Request for Information (RFI), as well as other procurement and program related criteria.

Interested parties are requested to provide information on their ability to satisfy any or all of the requirements outlined above.  Information should be provided by electronic mail to Mr. Gregory Lee at gregory.lee@navy.mil, with a copy to Ms. Rita Pegg at rita.pegg@navy.mil.  At a minimum, responses should include company name, size of business, point of contact (including telephone number, facsimile number and e-mail address), and a list of contracts within the past five (5) years under which the interested party has performed the same or similar work.  The deadline for submission of information is 7 Dec 07 at 2:30 pm.  This information is being requested for purposes of market research.  The Government will use this information to develop a list of potential bidders which will be published at a later date.    

Questions concerning this notice should be submitted to Mr. Gregory Lee with a copy to Ms. Rita Pegg at the email addresses cited above.  Telephone requests for information WILL NOT be accepted.

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security, Federal Emergency Management Agency, National Emergency Training Center, 16825 South Seton Avenue, Bldg D-123, Emmitsburg, MD 21727 intends to issue a solicitation, on behalf of the U.S. Fire Administration (USFA), for a contractor to operate an Information Technology Support Center (Help Desk) for state and local participants of the National Fire Incident Reporting System (NFIRS). NFIRS collects fire incident data from state fire data systems.  The state systems, in turn, collect data from their individual fire departments. State participation in NFIRS is entirely voluntary. The NFIRS represents the world's largest, national, annual database of fire incident information. Approximately 22,000 fire departments, located in 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the DOD participate in the NFIRS. Participating departments report an average of 14 million incidents and 1 million fires each year. When not responding to telephone or email inquires, Technical Support Center personnel may assist in verifying questionable incident data and fire department census data using records provided by the Contracting Officer?s Technical Representative (COTR). These activities are performed only as time permits when not responding to requests for assistance.  The period of performance shall be from June 1, 2008 through May 31, 2009.  The primary place of performance will be at the USFA, Emmitsburg, MD.

IAW FAR 19.1305 NETC will consider HUBZone set-asides.  If two or more HubZone firms express an interest in this requirement, then it will be competed among them IAW FAR 19.1305.  If less than two express an interest, it will be advertised for service-disabled veteran-owned small business and competed among them if two or more express an interest IAW FAR 19.1405.  If not, then the requirement may be set aside and competed among 8(a) firms or it may be awarded directly to an 8(a) firm with SBA coordination.   Competition is the preferred method of meeting government requirements.

Interested HubZone firms must provide to the Contract Specialist, Mr. Chuck Tama, a capability statement which addresses their experience in and capability of performing NFIRS IT Technical Support Center work. This may be e-mailed to charles.tama@dhs.gov  Contact info is:  Phone:  301-447-1455 FAX:  301-447-1092

The project should have a minimum of two components.  The first is an active community based rehabilitation program that contains features such as: the participants have a chronic condition (e.g., stroke, back pain, etc.), the intervention is low cost (e.g., adaptive physical activity), the site is in the local community, the collaborating health organization is providing the costs associated with the health intervention; the individuals? pay a nominal fee to participate, and the program coordination, quality monitoring and consultation is provided by a health organization.  The general characteristics of the program are that it is self sustaining, conducted outside of, but collaborating closely with the regional medical system.  Access to health services records and drug use of participants as well as individuals not involved in the community intervention with the same condition in the region is another component.  Successful completion of the proposed three year pilot project on one chronic condition may be expanded to include other regions of Italy or to other chronic conditions.  The Offeror is expected to provide 1. corporate organizational and 2. personnel management in the Tuscan region to oversee qualified staff for this work.  1.  The Offeror?s capability statement should demonstrate organizational experience in areas such as: a) working with low cost community interventions in a region; b) obtaining time series outcome data on a community intervention; c) data management experience in obtaining and linking different data sets; and, d) experience in working with regional health services information and pharmaceutical databases.  2.  Personnel should have experience in areas such as:  a) community interventions with individuals with chronic conditions; b) managing and coordinating the efforts of personnel required to perform the functions described above; c) providing data management support, systems analysis and design and computerized statistical analysis support; d) managing quality control procedures for database management, statistical analysis and data entry support work; and, e) managing data security procedures for data files, data forms and issues related to data confidentiality.  The above areas discussed in your capability statements will be evaluated according to the following criteria: 1) Organizational experience in developing community rehabilitation interventions for individuals with a chronic condition as outlined above; 2) An established relationship with a health organization that is able to finance the intervention in the community; 3) Qualifications and experience of professional and non-professional staff in performing both the intervention and analytic aspects of  work outlined above; and, 4) Organizational experience with the health authorities in the Tuscan region to facilitate the linking of data bases as outlined above.

<SUBJECT>70 -- Applying Computerized Adaptive Testing to the Social Security Adm. Disability Evaluation Process
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-SSN-CAT-001
<RESPDATE>021408
<CONTACT>Ann Argaman, Contracting Officer, Phone (301) 594-5919, Fax (301) 594-5920, Email ann.argaman@nih.gov - Ann Argaman, Contracting Officer, Phone (301) 594-5919, Fax (301) 594-5920, Email ann.argaman@nih.gov
<DESC>This is a market survey and sources sought synopsis to identify Small Business concerns (including 8(a) Small Disadvantaged; Service-disabled Veteran Owned; Woman-Owned; and HUBZone Business firms) with expertise and experience in developing innovative ways to apply computerized adaptive testing methods based on item response theory to evaluate the functional abilities of adults in relationship to performance requirements for substantial gainful employment.   Industry responses are encouraged from all interested sources and will aid in the development of the Government?s functional and technical requirements, by identifying capabilities of firms to provide the scope of services required to meet the Government?s needs.. In addition, responses will be utilized to aid in our determination for set-aside purposes.
 
The Rehabilitation Medicine Department in the Clinical Center  at NIH in Bethesda, Maryland has agreed to assist the Social Security Administration to explore innovative methods for augmenting the disability evaluation process.  This requires assessment of applicants? functional abilities across a variety of domains (such as movement and physical activities, basic and instrumental activities of daily living, and applied cognition) in relationship to functional demands in the workplace and features of the workplace, home, and community environments.  Rapid assessment methods are needed that are compatible with SSA processes and will yield easily interpretable results that can be efficiently and meaningfully integrated to provide accurate and uniform information about an applicant?s ability to engage in substantial gainful employment. 

To meet this objective, we will evaluate the feasibility of a promising new testing method that has the potential to precisely measures outcomes across the full continuum of human functioning using Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) coupled with Item Response Theory (IRT).  CAT represents a simple form of artificial intelligence software requiring computer technology for administration.  The demonstrated advantages of the CAT instruments compared to In more traditional testing methods are: reduced respondent burden, increased score precision, elimination of ceiling and floor effects, client-specific confidence intervals, monitoring of data quality in real time, and lower data collection costs.  Because functional outcomes have been shown to have a clear hierarchical structure, gains in precision and efficiency of score estimation are superior to traditional fixed forms of functional assessment, thus transforming the ways in which outcomes can be monitored.

We propose application of CAT methods to the determination of key domains useful to the SSA disability determination and claims decision-making processes.  There is substantial additional work to be done before the full potential of IRT-CAT can be realized in this environment. These efforts will include a thorough evaluation of the feasibility of implementing CAT tools in the SSA environment, further development of existing CAT instruments, and development of new CAT instruments to assess critical aspects important the disability evaluation process such as job related functional requirements and the workplace environment.

The contractor should have the ability to accomplish two major phases of this project including: 1) evaluation of the usefulness and feasibility of developing a CAT approach to evaluate individuals? functioning, their home, community and workplace environments, and their physical and mental job requirements in order to evaluate potential to engage in substantial gainful employment; and 2) if a CAT approach is determined to be feasible, development of CAT software specific to SSA data collection processes and methods of disability assessment. This is a SOURCES SOUGHT announcement only, and your response is not an offer.  All information submitted in response to this announcement is voluntary.  The Government will not pay for the information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in the preparation or submission of industry responses. SOLICITATIONS ARE NOT AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME AND AS SUCH ANY SUCH REQUESTS FOR SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE. Information collected via this market survey will in no way be used to limit or screen potential offerors from future consideration for selection.

FAX:  (703) 605-6743 (Attn: Michael Scheuchenzuber)

The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Technical Information Service (NTIS) in Springfield, VA, is currently performing market research to determine what order processing software currently exists in the marketplace from various vendors that can be used to take and track orders for approximately 3 million items in its permanent collection and track revenue and costs across all product and service lines.  Products are available in a variety of formats, such as paper, microfiche, electronic download, diskette, audio-visual and CD-ROM. NTIS handles demand requests for specific titles and maintains annual subscriptions with varying frequencies.  Each year, NTIS adds 30,000 titles to the collection, processes approximately 38,000 demand orders, ships 80,000 demand copies, maintains over 7,400 active subscriptions and ships 53,000 subscription copies.  In addition, NTIS provides distribution services to other federal agencies, processing 56,200 orders and shipping nearly 12 million copies, much of this in bulk.

NTIS currently operates a legacy system that hosts a commercial off-the-shelf order processing, accounts receivable and inventory software package developed by Computer Information Services, Inc. that has been heavily customized to NTIS's specifications.  The software was originally developed for the commercial publishing industry and runs on Hewlett Packard (HP) equipment, employing a HP-Unix operating system with shared disk space and multiple computer network access.  The order processing system has been in place for over ten years.  It is aging, highly customized, overly complex, and lacks certain flexibilities, such as adjusting for a change in the frequency of a subscription product.  The existing system is not supported by the private sector.  

Vendors of commercial order processing software are requested to respond in writing or by e-mail to this RFI to the Point of Contact (POC) listed in Virginia NO LATER THAN February 15, 2008.  The response should consist of three elements:

<DESC>This announcement is not a Request for Proposals (RFP) and does not commit the Government to award a contract now or in the future.  No solicitation is available at this time.  The purpose of this synopsis is to identify small business organizations with requisite qualifications to provide the services stated herein. Based on capability statements received in response to this Sources Sought Announcement this acquisition may be solicited as a 100% small business set-aside.  All small business organizations (SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, VOSB, and SDVOSB) are encouraged to respond to this notice.  This requirement is assigned a code of 541711 in the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), and the small business size standard for such requirements is 500 employees. 

The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD)/NIH, seeks capability statements from interested and qualified potential sources to provide repository services for pediatric pre-clinical and clinical trial activities being conducted under the authority of the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA). BPCA was reauthorized in September 2007, to improve pediatric therapeutics as well as labeling information for drugs used to treat children. The support services being sought by this notice are related to the establishment and operation of a large repository to receive, store, process, and ship biological, chemical and drug formulation samples that will be collected throughout multiple studies (as described below). NICHD anticipates that the repository will periodically distribute portions of stored samples to laboratories at the direction of the Government. NICHD is seeking information on the capabilities and limitations of organizations interested in providing the services described below.

BACKGROUND 

Since the inception of BPCA 2002, NICHD has awarded approximately fifteen (15) individual projects to organizations for the purposes of gathering information to improve pediatric therapeutics and inform pediatric labeling. Samples from these ongoing studies may be integrated into the samples collected and processed from future studies described in this sources sought.  Further information relating to BPCA can be found at:  http://bpca.nichd.nih.gov/. In September 2007, BPCA was reauthorized as part of the FDA Amendments Act (FDAAA). The legislation directs NICHD to initiate studies of critical importance to specific pediatric therapeutic areas to obtain results that will be submitted to FDA for consideration of labeling changes, and used to improve pediatric therapeutics.  NICHD anticipates that the clinical studies conducted under BPCA 2007 will focus on the PK/PD, safety and efficacy of therapeutics (including drugs, biologics, and therapeutic lifestyle modifications) used in children, and the pre-clinical studies will provide vital information to the pediatric therapeutics development processes.  

NICHD anticipates that thousands of diverse biological specimens and chemical samples will be collected from the preclinical (including samples from experimental animals and humans) and clinical (including samples from humans) studies conducted in 5 to 10 therapeutic areas (with multiple therapeutic approaches within each therapeutic area). 
?	Approximately 6,000 (six thousand) samples per year from phase 1 clinical studies
?	Approximately 15,000 (fifteen thousand) samples per year from phase 2 clinical studies
?	Approximately 500 (five hundred) samples per year from preclinical animal studies
?	Approximately 100 (one hundred) samples per year from formulation development studies
Biological samples may include, but are not limited to, tissue and organ samples, blood, urine, hair, nails, saliva, buccal cells, breast milk, placentas, umbilical cord, vaginal swabs, cord blood, and meconium from experimental animals as well as human participants, with studies conducted in vivo and in vitro.  Chemical and drug samples may include, but are not limited to, the active ingredient and excipients used in the formulation of a drug, solvents, vehicles, drug metabolites and breakdown products.   Samples from biologics may include materials used in preparing these therapeutic approaches, as well as samples from animals or humans treated with these therapies.  Additionally, prepared ampulated samples, such as digestates or extracts, and residual drug, chemical or biologic samples may be required to be stored. 

Plans for a repository for the multiple therapeutic studies being considered are evolving. Concepts being considered include shipping all samples directly from specific study sites to a central receiving repository where they will be processed, aliquotted and stored.  It is anticipated that some studies will be conducted outside of the United States, predominantly in European Union (EU) countries.  All sample processing, shipping and storage activities will be conducted under GLP and other relevant regulatory requirements for studies conducted in the EU and US with data being submitted for regulatory consideration (FDA, EMEA).  Periodically, at the direction of the government, the repository will send aliquots to analytic and clinical laboratories. Alternatively, some samples may be shipped first to the primary analytic and clinical laboratories for analysis with remaining material sent to the main repository. The ability to move a fraction of the biological and drug samples to a separate geographic location is required to mitigate the risk of sample loss in a disaster. 

The repository shall be located in facilities owned or operated by the contractor with specific space allocated for purpose of this contract, including back-up electrical supplies for computers and storage resources.  Organizations that submit capability statements in response to this notice will be evaluated against the following technical areas of experience and expertise:  

A.	Repository Experience and Expertise.  Provide names of projects and references, noting those in support of submission of data to FDA and/or EMEA for labeling of drugs, biologics and devices (contract number, contract officer and technical representative), distinguishing previous experience from current projects. Response must include number of samples as well as duration and description of services provided, in sufficient detail to demonstrate: 

i.	Extensive experience managing large biological and chemical sample repositories (approximately 25,000, thousand samples per year) for domestic and international trials. 
 
ii.	Experience in preparing and training appropriate clinical site staff on policies, procedures, and guidelines required for all necessary activities that involve the receipt, storage, and shipment of specimens and drug formulation.      
.
iii.	Experience in receiving, processing, and archiving biological samples (such as tissues, organs, blood, urine, hair, nails, buccal cells, breast milk, meconium, cord blood, umbilical cords, and tissues such as placenta from experimental animals and humans.

Most of the task order values may likely be in the lower half of that range (i.e. $300,000 to $30,000,000), and a significant amount of task order values will likely range from $1,000,000 to $5,000,000. <BR><BR>Task order values for the JOC may range from $3,000 to $5,000,000. Most of the task order values may likely be in the lower half of that range (i.e. $3,000 to $3,000,000), and a significant amount of task order values will likely range from $300,00 0 to $1,000,000.<BR><BR>More work is anticipated at locations with higher concentrations of facilities. Maps of major AFMS & MEDCOM medical facilities are located at the following links:<BR><BR>AFMS: https://kx.afms.mil/kxweb/dotmil/file/web/ctb_005389.htm <BR><BR>MEDCOM: http://www.armymedicine.army.mil/hc/medfacilities/medfacilities.htm<BR><BR>NOTE: Although the maps depict facilities worldwide, the geographical area of the AFMS and MEDCOM Programs under this synopsis is anticipated to be Nationwide, inclu ding Alaska, and Hawaii. <BR><BR>The anticipated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes for this program is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction with a corresponding Standard Industrial Code (SIC) of 1542; and a B usiness Size Standard of $31 Million.  It is anticipated that the program need for both AFMS and MEDCOM, may be met through the use of multiple and single award processes to establish various Firm-Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts.  The MATOC approach is anticipated to result in the establishment of qualified pools of contractors (each pool may have 3 to 6 firms) that compete fo r award of a task to perform the medical construction project.  JOCs by their very nature are Single Award Task Order Contracts (SATOC). The total number of MATOCs and JOCs anticipated to be awarded, and the size and type of any set-aside solicitation will  be determined based on the responses received from this sources sought synopsis.  <BR><BR>The Government must ensure there is adequate competition among contractors for work to be performed under a multiple award approach.  <BR><BR>Interested Offerors sha ll respond to this Sources Sought Synopsis by completing the Market Research Questionnaire which may be accessed at http://www.swf.usace.army.mil/pubdata/MED/Surveys/Default.aspx <BR>until 1600 (4 pm)  Central Standard Time on 14 February 2008.

All work provided under these contracts will occur in the U.S (to include Alaska and Hawaii). At this time, it is the intent to award the MATOC to three or four qualified design-build firms and to t wo 8(a) design-build firms.  It is the intent of the MEDJOC to award one contract for work located in the eastern US and one for work located in the western US. <BR><BR>No proposals are being requested at this conference.  Interested parties are invited to  submit a request for a forty-minute period to meet with AFMS/MEDCOM representatives and make informal presentations outlining their capabilities related to health facilities planning, design, and construction.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Proposed addition of Labels, Laser to the Procurement List of the Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled.
<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services.  It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of Laser Labels by the Federal Government. 
 
The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne (formerly JWOD) Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (P/L).  You can view the P/L on our website at www.jwod.gov.  Once a product is added to the P/L to be performed by a nonprofit agency, it is no longer available to be provided by commercial firms.

The Committee has been asked to consider adding the total Government requirement for the following product to the P/L:

Labels, Laser (File Folder)
7530-00-NIB-0840
7530-00-NIB-0841
7530-00-NIB-0842
7530-00-NIB-0843
7530-00-NIB-0844

The contracting agency involved is the General Services Administration, Region 2, New York, NY.
  
Before adding a product to the P/L, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing Laser Labels  to GSA and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income.  Similar products are:

AVE 5026 - Label, File, 15/16x3-7/16, AST
AVE 5027 - Label, File, 15/16x3-7/16, WE
AVE 5567 ? Label, File, Hang, 1/5 Cut
AVE 6466 ? Label , Laser, REMV, 3-7/8x2/3, AST
MAC ML-FF30 - Label , Laser, REMV, 3-7/8x2/3, AST
ELI 26041 - Label , Laser, REMV, 3-7/8x2/3, AST
AVE 8066 ? Label, INKJT, REMV, F/FLDR, WE
AVE 30631 - 	Label, INKJT, REMV, F/FLDR, WE
ELI 26040 - Label, INKJT, REMV, F/FLDR, WE
UNV 80111 - Label, INKJT, REMV, F/FLDR, WE
	
	
In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:  

1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period

2) Revenues accrued by providing Laser Labels to GSA for the same most recent 12-month period 

3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to GSA.  

The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than February 27, 2008 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the P/L.

It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis.  Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to
(703) 603-0030.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.  If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.

When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well. If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporations to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporations total revenue data.

General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.jwod.gov.  If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the P/L, please contact Ms. Connie Mehr at (703) 603-2116.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Proposed addition of Pen, Vista Gel, 1.2mm, to the Procurement List of the Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled
<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services.  This notice concerns an action which may affect your company's continued business with the Federal Government and should not be disregarded.  It is in your best interest to respond to this notice.

The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day (JWOD) Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne (formerly JWOD) Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (P/L).  You can view the P/L on our website at www.jwod.gov.  Once a product is added to the P/L to be performed by a nonprofit agency, it is no longer available to be provided by commercial firms.

The Committee has been asked to consider adding the following product to the P/L:
Pen, Vista Gel, 1.2 mm Retractable Ballpoint, NSNs: 7520-00-NIB-1969 (black); 7520-00-NIB-1970 (blue); 7520-00-NIB-1971 (red).

The contracting agency involved is the General Services Administration, Region 2, New York, NY. 
   
Before adding a product to the P/L, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing 1.2 mm retractable ballpoint pens to GSA and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income.  Similar products are:

PAP 89465 ? 1.4 mm ?Profile?		PAP 89466 ? 1.4 mm ?Profile?
PAP 70608 ? 1.4 mm ?Altitude?		PAP 70609 ? 1.2 mm ?Altitude?
PAP 89467 ? 1.2 mm ?Profile?

In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:  

1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period

2) Revenues accrued by providing 1.2 mm retractable ballpoint pens GSA for the same most recent 12-month period 

3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to GSA.  

The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than February 8, 2008 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed product be added to the P/L.

It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis.  Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to
(703) 603-0030.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.  If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.

When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well. If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporations to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporations total revenue data.

General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.jwod.gov.

<SUBJECT>Deployable Instrumented Training System (DITS) Support
<DESC>The Marine Corps acquired a Deployable Instrumented Training Systems (DITS) appended instrumentation system with man-worn and vehicle instrumentation kits to track dismounted marines and vehicles traversing open terrain by augmenting USMC personal and vehicular Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (MILES) tactical engagement simulation systems with a GPS and RF based tracking system. The Saab Instrumentation is a unique system developed specifically for military training and was evaluated as part of the OSD Foreign Comparative Test (FCT) program from 2004 to 2007 after an extensive market survey. The system was successfully tested under the congressionally funded program and met the operational requirements documented for range instrumentation training. Following system evaluation, the (58) MILES Interface Kits-Personnel (MIK-P), (12) MILES Interface Kits-Vehicle (MIK-V), (1) claymore mine simulator, and (1) DITS Portable Base Station trailer were provided to th!  e Marine Corps Basic School (TBS - Marine Corps Officers? basic training and the Infantry Officer?s Course(IOC) which both train Marine second lieutenants in preparation for deployment) for field training support and enhanced After Action Review (AAR) capability.  Under the original contract, enough equipment to outfit one maneuver company, plus Opposing Forces (OPFOR), was to be procured in support of Camp Lejeune, North Carolina and Camp Pendleton, California.  The equipment at MCB Quantico will outfit one TBS maneuver platoon. Since contract award, it has been determined by TECOM that MCB Quantico requires enough equipment to outfit one TBS maneuver company, OPFOR, and the IOC.  An increase in value to contract M67854-07-D-8049 is anticipated to procure additional equipment. Contractors with the capability to meet specified requirements should provide a response indicating their ability to do so.  The anticipated delivery date for this effort is 30 Sep 08.  This request in no way implies either implicitly or explicitly that respondents will be compensated in any way by the US Government for information or materials provided.  Any information provided to the Government in response to this notice will become USMC property and will not be returned.  All proprietary or classified information will be treated appropriately.  All interested contractors shall submit a written response to Cecilia Hansborough within 30 days after publication of this notice.

INTRODUCTION

The National Weather Service (NWS) provides weather, hydrologic, and climate forecasts and warnings for the United States, its territories, adjacent waters and ocean areas, for the protection of life and property and the enhancement of the national economy. NWS data and products form a national information database and infrastructure which can be used by other governmental agencies, the private sector, the public, and the global community.

BACKGROUND

The NWS has been operating numerous Data Collection Platforms (DCPs) in support of the Upper Colorado data network for over 20 years. These DCPs have been recording temperature and precipitation.  Many of these platforms are co-located with river staging equipment owned and maintained by various partner agencies, primarily the Bureau of Reclamation, and the United States Geological Survey (USGS).  This critical weather and stage data is utilized by NWS forecast offices, as well as multiple U.S. State and local government agencies, as well as Mexico.  The current DCPs and Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) transmission equipment in the network requires upgrading and/or replacing for the following reasons:

 1) DCP Equipment reliability due to age.

 2) Lack of spare parts left to repair/replace broken DCP equipment.

 3) Interfacing the DCPs will soon be impossible due to laptop compatibility with very antiquated DOS programs.

4) The current network transmits hourly via GOES transmission equipment at a rate of 100 bits per second.  All owners of low data rate data transmission equipment (100 bits per second) have been mandated by National Environmental Satellite Data Information Service (NESDIS) to upgrade to high data rate (300 bits per second) data transmission within a few years. Therefore the low data rate GOES transmission equipment (100 bits per second) will need to be upgraded to GPS self timed high data rate capable data transmission equipment (300 bits per second).

DESCRIPTION

Using DCPs that can easily read and/or transmit weather data from precipitation sensors that are already on-site is critical. Each Upper Colorado site is equipped with Fischer-Porter model #: 35-1559EAXXXX1 precipitation accumulation gauge. The DCP must be compatible with this Fischer-Porter precipitation accumulation gauge. This ensures that there will be no loss of winter precipitation data by relying on a non-heated tipping gauge.

The DCPs must be able to interface with the existing BEI shaft encoder model #: L25F-F48-1000-ABC-4469-LED-SM14-S, as well as a Synergenics model 503 shaft encoder.  If this is not possible we will need information as to what is required to allow these DCP?s to be compatible, or information on an acceptable, compliant replacement for the shaft encoder models mentioned.
There are approximately 70 DCP sites in the current network.  These sites communicate by using GPS (Global Positioning System) self timed GOES satellite up link.  The existing GOES transmitters will not transmit high data rate (300 bits per second).  Therefore, the GOES transmission equipment will need to be updated in order to support the new high data rate transmission speed of 300 bits per second, as well as maintain compatibility with the new DCPs.  Information on GOES transmission equipment, as well as data rate certification standards should be included in response to this request.   

There are no utilities available at the DCP locations.   Therefore the entire network will need to rely on solar power, in a variety of extreme weather conditions.  Information supporting the DCPs ability to operate in this configuration, as well as information on any specific hardware necessary to support this requirement should be included in response to this request.   

The temperature sensor currently installed at each site is Weathertronics model #:  4480, and we are not sure if it is compatible with new DCP technology.  Therefore, we will need to know if the temperature sensor equipment will need to be updated in order to maintain compatibility with the new DCPs, or if the new DCP will interface with the existing sensor.   If the sensor is not compatible with the new DCP, we will need to acquire information on acceptable compatible replacements for these sensors.  Information on any associated radiation shielding and cabling should also be included in response to this request.

These DCPs will need the ability to accept additional data collection sensor or devices.  The DCP will need to have a minimum of 8 ports in order to support this potential expansion.

Training will need to be provided in order for the NWS to effectively install and maintain this network.  We need to acquire information on available training, and the locations where these training sessions are available.

We require information as to the length of manufacturers? warranty.

This equipment must be commercial off the shelf (COTS) product that will continue to be manufactured throughout the duration of the deployment of this network, and supported for a period of no less than 15 years after purchase.  All software, interface hardware, repair and training support must also remain in place for the expected life of this network.

<SUBJECT>A -- TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY  Photonic System to Assist Rock Excavation
<DESC>TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY 
Photonic System to Assist Rock Excavation 

Opportunity:	Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the Lawrence Livermore National Security LLC (LLNS), under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering the opportunity to license and commercialize an enhanced technology to assist the rock excavation operations utilizing high-intensity light generated by arrays of optical diode bars.

Background:  The Photon Science and Applications Program at LLNL has developed a compact diode array capable of delivering high energy laser pulses resulting in a less costly and possibly safer process for assisting rock excavation which could be vital for boring tunnels and deep well drilling. This approach may alter the dynamic and the cost equation for such drilling.

Certain deep well drilling can necessitate a year to complete with up to 200 days spend drilling because of the hardness of certain types of rocks. Technologies that can increase rate of penetration and drilling accuracy would impact the economics of deep gas production. 
Other factors that need to be taken into consideration are drill bits and tripping. Drill bits that cost $50,000 to $100,000 each may last only days or hours, and tripping the drillstring out of and into the hole each time the bit needs to be replaced leads to hours or days of nonproductive time. As a result, one important goal is to increase the life of drill bits. Furthermore, any technological improvements to speed up drilling and improve safety will substantially reduce cost and increase production efficiency for oil/gas or any other types of drilling.
	
Description:   The LLNL system, comprised of compact one-pound packages of 10kW optical light diode arrays, offers simple integration into existing and conventional drill bit head assemblies. This allows the light to be in very close proximity to the rock surface itself, resulting in the formation of cracks and fissures in the rock material from the induced optical radiation. The significantly weakened spots in the rock provide anchors for the drill bits to sink their ?teeth? into, thus providing better bit engagement. This results in both the tip and the sides of the drill teeth being used to remove material, adding to increased efficiency of the rock removal process. Furthermore, the weakened rock is easier to excavate, which will enhance drill bit lifetime and thus increase the uptime for drilling.  This unique technology has been successfully demonstrated on two different types of rock, Indiana Limestone and Berea Sandstone. Experimental tests clearly show that even at very modest irradiation levels, on the order of 1 kW per square centimeter, sufficient energy is available to develop fissures/cracks in the substrates. At higher energy level, the laser could fracture the rocks. 
		
Potential Applications:  The LLNL?s low maintenance, compact, and cost-effective 2-D optical diode array, with its high average power and high power density, has applications in many processes such as assisting rock excavation for mining and tunnel drilling operations. 

Development Status:  LLNS has two issued U. S. patents covering certain lens duct technology: U.S. Patent Nos. US 6,160,934A and US 5,307,430A. Two provisional patents for down-hole drilling have also been filed. LLNL is seeking industry partners with a demonstrated ability to commercialize these inventions.  Moving critical technology beyond the Laboratory to the commercial world helps our licensees gain a competitive edge in the marketplace. All licensing activities are conducted under policies relating to the strict nondisclosure of company proprietary information.  

Please visit the IPAC website at: 
https://ipo.llnl.gov/workwithus/partneringprocess.php for more information on working with LLNL and the Laboratory?s industrial partnering and technology transfer process.  

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's innovative laser technology for rock excavation, tunnel boring, and mining should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.	Company Name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology.

BACKGROUND:  

The U.S. Agency for International Development West Bank and Gaza (USAID/WBG) is an essential element of the U.S. Government's support for the Palestinian-Israeli peace process.  Over the past several years, USAID/WBG has devoted more than half of its funds to supporting the development of infrastructure, particularly in the water sector.  USAID?s strategy, aimed directly at one of the greatest needs in this arid region, has been to increase water supplies in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The Mission has financed both large-scale well-drilling and water pipeline projects in the Bethlehem-Hebron and Jenin areas as well as smaller, village-scale projects throughout the West Bank and Gaza. This has provided potable water to more than 1,000,000 Palestinian beneficiaries.  In addition, USAID has funded several sewage projects including improvements to the Gaza sewage system and Gaza City Wastewater Treatment Plant benefiting more than 300,000 people and road rehabilitation projects to reduce transportation barriers for more than 600,000 Palestinians.

This position is for a senior engineer to work in the Water Resources and Infrastructure (WRI) Office responsible for the achievement of the Mission's Strategic Objective #14 "Greater Access to Better Quality Water and Other Infrastructure Services."

Statement of Work

1.0  Scope and Purpose

1.1  The FDA Biosciences Library requires unlimited online web access, via IP, to a core set of resources with searchable subject areas in  Plastics, Rubbers, Safety, Health & Hygiene, Pharmaceuticals, Cosmetics & Toiletries, Biochemistry, Biology & Biotechnology, Chemistry & Chemical Engineering, Toxicology, Food Science, Industrial Materials, Sensors Technology, and Systems Engineering.  Unlimited access to Merck Index, Patty?s Toxicology and Sax?s Dangerous Properties is also required. 
 The online platform must allow quick searches across all resources simultaneously in one search statement.  Access is 24/7 for Agency staff and reduces the need for multiple individual copies of expensive resources. 

2.0	Specific Requirements

2.1	The FDA requires unlimited online access to books, handbooks and encyclopedias in the the following searchable subject areas:

?	Plastics & Rubbers, Safety, Health & Hygiene, Pharmaceuticals, Cosmetics & Toiletries, Biochemistry, Biology & Biotechnology, Chemistry & Chemical Engineering, Toxicology, Food Science, Industrial Materials, Sensors Technology, and Systems Engineering.  
?	Unlimited access to Sax?s Dangerous Properties, Merck Index
?	
2.2 	For the list of publications, the contractor shall provide the following:

a.  A site license for 24/7 desktop web access, via IP, for the Agency
b.  Customer service shall be available to troubleshoot website/connectivity issues via phone, email, etc.
c.  Researchers and librarians need access to all of the resources and must be able to search selected resources with one query and one interface.

Ideally, the FDA Biosciences Library prefers to search across one platform rather than multiple platforms.  This method provides a more efficient manner for FDA researchers by saving of overall search time necessary for finding necessary information and performing the research work necessary to meet the mission of FDA.  

FDA Biosciences Library requests option years as part of a recurring subscription.
The contractor is expected to troubleshoot access as needed, but it will not be necessary to respond during non-operational hours as defined above.

7.0  Section 508

The contractor shall provide paperwork, called a Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT), regarding the 508 Compliance status of the product(s) at the same time the bid is offered. For more information about 508 Compliance, please visit the following site:
http://508.hhs.gov/vendors.htm

The below links will provide overview and assistance to what is needed. A service still must be 508 compliant. 

The purpose of this part is to implement section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 794d). Section 508 requires that when Federal agencies develop, procure, maintain, or use electronic and information technology, Federal employees with disabilities have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access and use by Federal employees who are not individuals with disabilities, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the agency. Section 508 also requires that individuals with disabilities, who are members of the public seeking information or services from a Federal agency, have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to that provided to the public who are not individuals with disabilities, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the agency. 

So if federal employees or the public will use EIT that we procure, or develop, then it has to be accessible.  Technical standards that apply to web-based resources are provided below:

Subpart B -- Technical Standards
? 1194.22 Web-based intranet and internet information and applications.
(a) A text equivalent for every non-text element shall be provided (e.g., via "alt", "longdesc", or in element content). 
(b) Equivalent alternatives for any multimedia presentation shall be synchronized with the presentation. 
(c) Web pages shall be designed so that all information conveyed with color is also available without color, for example from context or markup. 
(d) Documents shall be organized so they are readable without requiring an associated style sheet. 
(e) Redundant text links shall be provided for each active region of a server-side image map. 
(f) Client-side image maps shall be provided instead of server-side image maps except where the regions cannot be defined with an available geometric shape. 
(g) Row and column headers shall be identified for data tables. 
(h) Markup shall be used to associate data cells and header cells for data tables that have two or more logical levels of row or column headers. 
(i) Frames shall be titled with text that facilitates frame identification and navigation. 
(j) Pages shall be designed to avoid causing the screen to flicker with a frequency greater than 2 Hz and lower than 55 Hz. 
(k) A text-only page, with equivalent information or functionality, shall be provided to make a web site comply with the provisions of this part, when compliance cannot be accomplished in any other way. The content of the text-only page shall be updated whenever the primary page changes. 
(l) When pages utilize scripting languages to display content, or to create interface elements, the information provided by the script shall be identified with functional text that can be read by assistive technology. 
(m) When a web page requires that an applet, plug-in or other application be present on the client system to interpret page content, the page must provide a link to a plug-in or applet that complies with ?1194.21(a) through (l). 
(n) When electronic forms are designed to be completed on-line, the form shall allow people using assistive technology to access the information, field elements, and functionality required for completion and submission of the form, including all directions and cues. 
(o) A method shall be provided that permits users to skip repetitive navigation links. 
(p) When a timed response is required, the user shall be alerted and given sufficient time to indicate more time is required. 
Note to ?1194.22:
1. The Board interprets paragraphs (a) through (k) of this section as consistent with the following priority 1 Checkpoints of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 (WCAG 1.0) (May 5, 1999) published by the Web Accessibility Initiative of the World Wide Web Consortium:

(f)	9.1
(g)	5.1
(h)	5.2
(i)	12.1
(j)	7.1
(k)	11.4


2. Paragraphs (l), (m), (n), (o), and (p) of this section are different from WCAG 1.0. Web pages that conform to WCAG 1.0, level A (i.e., all priority 1 checkpoints) must also meet paragraphs (l), (m), (n), (o), and (p) of this section to comply with this section. WCAG 1.0 is available at http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WAI-WEBCONTENT-19990505. 
Subpart D -- Information, Documentation, and Support
? 1194.41 Information, documentation, and support.
(a) Product support documentation provided to end-users shall be made available in alternate formats upon request, at no additional charge. 
(b) End-users shall have access to a description of the accessibility and compatibility features of products in alternate formats or alternate methods upon request, at no additional charge.

    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ?more than 50 percent? for ?at least 80 percent? each place it appears.

    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliate. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).    
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights.

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.

The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.

The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  ?Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded.

(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

(End of provision)

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.

If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D.

Notice to Employees 
Under Federal law, employees cannot be required to join a union or maintain membership in a union in order to retain their jobs.

However, employees who are not union members can object to the use of their payments for certain purposes and can only be required to pay their share of union costs relating to collective bargaining, contract administration, and grievance adjustment. 
If you do not want to pay that portion of dues or fees used to support activities not related to collective bargaining, contract administration, or grievance adjustment, you are entitled to an appropriate reduction in your payment. If you believe that you have been required to pay dues or fees used in part to support activities not related to collective bargaining, contract administration, or grievance adjustment, you may be entitled to a refund and to an appropriate reduction in future payments. 
For further information concerning your rights, you may wish to contact the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) either at one of its Regional offices or at the following address or toll free number:

(d) In the event that the Contractor does not comply with any of the requirements set forth in paragraphs (b), (c), or (g), the Secretary may direct that this contract be cancelled, terminated, or suspended in whole or in part, and declare the Contractor ineligible for further Government contracts in accordance with procedures at 29 CFR Part 470, Subpart B?Compliance Evaluations, Complaint Investigations and Enforcement Procedures. Such other sanctions or remedies may be imposed as are provided by 29 CFR Part 470, which implements Executive Order 13201, or as are otherwise provided by law.

(2) Download a copy of the poster from the Office of Labor-Management Standards website at http://www.olms.dol.gov; or 
(3) Reproduce and use exact duplicate copies of the Department of Labor?s official poster. 
    (g) The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause in every subcontract or purchase order that exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold, entered into in connection with this contract, unless exempted by the Department of Labor Deputy Assistant Secretary for Labor-Management Programs on account of special circumstances in the national interest under authority of 29 CFR 470.3(c). For indefinite quantity subcontracts, the Contractor shall include the substance of this clause if the value of orders in any calendar year of the subcontract is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.

 It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

INFORMAL FORUM WITH THE OMBUDSMAN:  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract


number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

FORMAL AGENCY PROTEST WITH THE OMBUDSMAN:  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d) (2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

Mfr: Wind River Systems
Justification for Brand Name Only: 
Wind River's VxWorks is currently deployed across the entire C-5 fleet as the real-time operating system (RTOS) for the Malfunction Detection Analysis and Recording System (MADARS).  Ongoing software maintenance activities require licenses to develop and time operating systems are available for purchase or use, the MADARS software is written specifically to take advantage of the VxWorks RTOS architecture and system calls.  Use of any other RTOS would require an extensive rewrite of the MADARS software and is not cost effective at this time.

*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  This acquisition is 100% small business set-aside.  In accordance with the Non-Manufacturer Rule, to qualify under a small business set-aside, the distributor and the manufacturer must qualify as a Small Business under the NAICS code identified above.

***The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for a 250 MHz Optical Frequency Comb Synthesizer to be used in the Atomic Physics Division at NIST, Gaithersburg, MD.  ***

BACKGROUND:
The 250 MHz optical frequency comb synthesizer uses a mode-locked femtosecond Er-doped fiber laser, octave-spanning spectral broadening in a nonlinear fiber, and self-referenced stabilization to generate ultra-precise optical lines (forming an optical comb) in the near infra-red and visible regions.  The lines in the optical comb are exactly spaced by the repetition rate (250 MHz) of the Er-fiber femtosecond laser. The frequency comb synthesizer attains the accuracy of the radio-frequency reference with which it is stabilized/locked, allowing optical frequencies to be measured with an accuracy as high as 1 part in 1014 after greater than1s integration. Turn-key operation shall be supported by embedded microcontroller and a computer (PC) with the necessary software for automated and continuous operation, systems control and monitoring, as well as data acquisition extending over the duration of many days.  The system shall include all necessary components and monitoring/display equipments. 

All interested Offerors shall provide a quote for the following line item(s):

Line Item 0001:  One (1) Each, 250 MHz Optical Frequency Comb Synthesizer

All Contractors shall meet or exceed the following required minimum specifications:

I.  Accuracy and stability:
1.	The 250 MHz Er-fiber frequency comb shall be able to measure optical frequencies with an accuracy of  1 part in 1014 or better after 1 second or the same accuracy as the reference source used to stabilize the comb, whichever applies first.
2.	The stability (Allan Deviation) of the frequency comb shall be 5 parts in 1013 at 1 sec or better, unless limited by the reference used.    

II. 250MHz Er-doped-Fiber (EDF) Femtosecond laser:
1.	An Erbium-doped fiber laser is used for the mode-locked femtosecond laser with a variable cavity length.  The output of this laser followed by an EDF amplifier provides pulses which are less than 100 femtosecond wide, and an average power of 300 mW or higher.
2.	The center wavelength of the Er-doped fiber laser is 1560 nm plus/minus 20 nm.
3.	The system shall provide frequency comb lines over a total spectral range from 530 nm to 2100 nm, or better.  This is provided in two stages?a near infra-red stage from ~1050 nm to ~2100 nm, and a visible stage from ~530 nm to ~900 nm. 
4.	The pulse repetition rate of the laser is 250 MHz (or higher). 
5.	The pulse repetition rate of the laser can be varied by 2.5 MHz (full range) for synchronization (via in situ tuning of the laser cavity length) while the system is continuously operating.  This shall allow measurements at different pulse repetition rates without the need for realignment?as happens when determining the mode number, for example.
6.	The laser head shall be temperature-stabilized, with the laser head and electronics separated.
7.	The femto-second Er-fiber laser shall provide 3 optical fiber output ports, each with an average power greater than 20 mW centered at 1560 nm with pulse repetition rate of 250 MHz.  In addition, a monitor port shall be provided.
8.	The beam shape is TEM00 with beam quality factor M2 less than 1.2 after an EDF amplifier.


III. Stabilization of the Repetition Rate:
1.	The 250 MHz Er-fiber frequency comb system includes the complete control electronics for phase-locking the repetition rate to a 10 MHz external reference with signal strength between a minimum of +5 dBm and a maximum of +17 dBm.
2.	All components of the stabilization electronics shall be provided, including a low-noise synthesizer.


IV. Stabilization of the Carrier-Envelope-Offset (CEO) frequency:
1.	When seeded with an input greater than 20 mW from the Er-fiber femtosecond laser (see II), the EDF amplifier provides ultra-short pulses with an average output power of 300 mW or more.
2.	EDF-amplified pulses are used in the ?f-2f interferometer? for carrier-envelope stabilization by ?self-referencing.?
3.	All components for the detection and stabilization of the carrier-envelope offset (CEO) by self-referencing shall be provided?second-harmonic generation with a crystal, the f-2f interferometer, the complete phase lock loop, etc. 
4.	A nonlinear fiber is used for octave-spanning spectral broadening from 1050 nm to 2100 nm. 
5.	Carrier-envelope-offset (CEO) frequency tuning across the entire free spectral range.  Tuning of the CEO frequency by more than 250 MHz is made possible by an integrated cavity wedge. 
6.	Pump power control and intra-cavity wedges for coarse and fine control to implement CEO stabilization.  
7.	Stabilization to a radio-frequency (RF) source or to a stabilized optical source.



V. Automation, Monitoring and Data Acquisition for Turn-key, Continuous Operation:
1.	An embedded microcontroller is used to automate mode-locking (front-panel use or RS232 interface).
2.	A computer (PC including monitor) with the necessary software is also provided for automated and non-stop (24hours/7days-a-week) operation, systems control and monitoring, as well as data acquisition extending over the duration of many days.  
3.	Software shall be provided for full control of the Er-fiber laser, the various amplifier stages, frequency synthesizers, etc.
4.	System status, hardware parameters and counter values shall be recorded as computer data files.  
5.	Data readout is provided for monitoring the laser performance and beat signal strength
6.	The system includes a 4-channel-counter without dead time for counting optical frequencies
7.	Display units include an RF spectrum analyzer, and a two-channel oscilloscope. The spectrum analyzer shall have a frequency range of at least 1 GHz, amplitude measurement range from -100 dBm to +10 dBm, and resolution bandwidths (3dB) of 20 KHz and 500 KHz; or better.
8.	Also provided are enclosures and 19-inch rack tower for control electronics.



VI. Beat Signal with an External Source:

1.	A free-space set-up for the detection of the beat signal between the frequency comb and an external CW-laser (NIST supplied) having a central wavelength of approximately 1500 nm, with an operating range of about 300 nm.
2.	A detector is provided for observing the beat note. For an external laser power of more than 1 mW average power, the beat note shall have a S/N greater than 30 dB in a 100 kHz bandwidth. 
3.	The center wavelength can be changed by replacing the detector and some optics components in the set-up.
4.	Data acquisition of the beat signal shall be included.  The detection electronics shall provide an output which can be used directly with a counter included in the package.
5.	This set-up shall be ready-to-use?including all opto-mechanical components aligned and mounted. 
  
VII. Installation and Training:

a.	Trained engineers from the manufacturer shall install the system within 7 to 10 days after delivery
b.	After installation and testing at our NIST site, a written test report shall be provided to document the actual performance of the installed system.
c.	Two days (or more) of staff training for operating the system shall be included in the package.

CONTRACTOR-MISSION RELATIONSHIPS 
 
   (a) The contractor acknowledges that this contract is an important part of the U.S. Foreign Assistance 
Program and agrees that his/her duties will be carried out in such a manner as to be fully commensurate with the responsibilities that this entails.  
   (b) While in the Cooperating Country, the contractor is expected to show respect for the conventions, customs, and institutions of the Cooperating Country and not interfere in its political affairs.
 
   (c) If the contractor's conduct is not in accordance with paragraph (b) of this provision, the contract may be terminated under General Provision 16 of this contract.  The Contractor recognizes the right of the U.S. Ambassador to direct his/her immediate removal from any country when, in the discretion of the Ambassador, the interests of the United States so require.
 
   (d) The Country Director is the chief representative of CDC in the Cooperating Country.  In this capacity, he/she is responsible for the total CDC Program in the Cooperating Country including certain administrative responsibilities set forth in this contract and for advising CDC regarding the performance of the work under the contract and its effect on the U.S. Foreign Assistance Program.  The contractor will be responsible for performing his/her duties in accordance with the statement of duties called for by the contract. However, he/she shall be under the general policy guidance of the Country Director, and shall keep the Country Director or his/her designated representative currently informed of the progress of the work under this contract.

CDC shall approve a fair and reasonable amount for obtaining the required coverage as a direct cost to the contract.  In order for CDC to reimburse the cost of medevac insurance, CDC shall require the contractor to furnish evidence of obtaining medevac insurance for the employee and all accompanying family members on U.S. Government travel orders and its cost, after issuance of an offer letter.

<DESC>FA4452-08-R-0003 HIGH DECK PATIENT LOADING PLATFORM VEHICLES
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
January 29, 2008


1. Cabin Boarding Stairs.   Can you provide additional information?  Is a side entrance door for the operator to enter and exit the main body area required, or, to enter, the operator unfolds the lift gate at the back end and enters thru the sliding doors?

ANSWER:  A way to access the cabin deck is needed so that the lift gate operators can get up to the cabin without having to use the lift gate (What if the lift gate isn?t operable?  A separate door into the cabin isn?t needed, but a way to get up to the sliding cabin door without the lift gate is required)

2.  Generator.  The spec calls for gasoline powered 10KW generator.  Do you mean an Onan model CMQD Quiet Diesel?

ANSWER:  Diesel fuel type for the generator

3.  Rear Lift.  Lift is called out in two places.  The 1st place is page 5 under general vehicle/van body.  The 2nd is on page 7.  Is the correct description on page 7?

ANSWER:  Page 7 is the correct statement on gurney/litter lift.

4.  Are you providing the gurneys or do we need to quote that also?
Also we need specs on the gurneys either way so that we can find the appropriate gurney racks that are called for.

ANSWER:  Gurney's aren't the requirement, litters are.  HDPLP requires the ability to carry 9 NATO standard litters.  These should be on a rack, so the litters are not floor loaded.  A three high litter rack system is the standard in AE operations.  Litter arms must accommodate the standard NATO litter and be capable of supporting 375 pounds per position.  Litter racks can be manufactured, or procured from a commercial company.  Specific dimension information is listed in the NATO Standardization Agency Agreement, Subject:  Stretcher, Bearing and Brackets and Attachment Support. 


5.    Is it your intention to leave the rear lift gate in a unfolded deployed state? Or, do you intend to fold up the lift gate against the back of the body when moving the vehicle? If you intend to fold it up when moving it, keep in mind the handrails would have to be installed or removed each time.

ANSWER:  The rear lift gate is lifted against the back of the body when vehicle is moved.  Prior to movement, the handrails are folded down and secured to the rear lift platform.  This is IAW the vehicle training plan.

In the event such audit reveals that the actual inventory of unexpired, undamaged products in what is represented to be the consignment inventory does not conform to the products and quantities as shown above, NMCP shall promptly issue a purchase order to Vendor to pay for the products representing the shortfall, and execute an appropriate Consignment Transaction Form as requested by Vendor.
