<DESC>The USDA, Agricultural Research Service, Hard Red Spring & Durum Wheat Quality Lab, Fargo, North Dakota, intends to enter into a single source contract with C. W. Brabender Instruments, South Hackensack, New Jersey, for the purchase of an Extensograph E for measuring and recording the stretching properties of wheat flour doughs before and after rest and the effects of additives on stretching properties and the effects of different oxidation and reduction chemicals and other ingredients that are used in the production of commercially baked products, including a dough homogenizer, dough moulder, and temperature controlled relaxation cabinet, stretching device and electronic measuring system.  This equipment is used in several Federal and State research laboratories and commercial baking laboratories that test flour quality traits.  It is critical that results generated are well correlated with results from other dough rheology instruments such as a Government-owned Farinograph E and Mixograph.  The dough stretching and strength results will be compared among commercial wheat cultivars and advanced breeding lines that have potential for commercial production.  The physical dough test protocol for the extensograph method is AACC Method 54-10, which will be applicable in the Wheat Quality Laboratory to test extensibility traits of wheat flour dough.  Dough extensibility data from the extensograph is important in many wheat importing countries and the information will be used by wheat breeders in the development and release of new varieties that meet export demands.  Because of the built-in homogenizer, rounder, and humidified chamber of the Extensograph E, there is the ability to achieve consistent results in testing comparing dough extensibility traits among wheat genotypes that are submitted by wheat breeders and guarantees consistent conditions prior to the actual stretching (evaluation) of the dough sample.  *Provide Qualification Statement by Close of Business May 2, 2005, if interested in this procurement.

<DESC>The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) intends to issue a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) not to exceed $25,000 for Information Technology (IT) on site training as described below.  Proposals are being requested by January 21.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued.  

Orders will be placed against this BPA via the U.S. Department of Labor Training Authorization and Evaluation Form DL 1-101.  The vendor will provide the BLS with the following training as required:  

  <>  TPL Tables for Windows Introduction:  
This three-day course is designed for any personnel who need to understand the process of creating tables using TPL TABLES, including any personnel involved in producing, publishing or editing tables, producing or publishing data, or management of these areas.  TPL TABLES is a general-purpose cross-tabulation software package.  It is based on the BLS-developed mainframe TPL system. TPL TABLES has been commercially available since 1987.  It is used at government agencies, private companies, associations, and universities around the world.  TPL TABLES is used to summarize data and present the results in a tabular form.  Its tabulation engine is fast and efficient.  The output produced by TPL TABLES is considered publication-quality.  This course will teach the participants how to use the MS-DOS editor or the Windows editor to create the text files used in TPL TABLES jobs, how to write the data description file (codebook file) needed to create tables, how to design table request files that specify the structure of the table output, and how to write format request files to produce the publication ready table formats.  

  <>  TPL Tables for Windows Intermediate:  
This three-day course is designed for any personnel who need advanced knowledge for creating tables using TPL TABLES, including any personnel involved in producing, publishing or editing tables, producing, analyzing or publishing data, or management of these areas.  This course will briefly review the material taught in Introduction to TPL TABLES for the PC and cover more advanced topics, including generating statistics, sophisticated table design, and complete table formatting.  

  <>  TPL-SQL for ODBC:  
This is a two-day, hands-on course.  The TPL-SQL database interface gives you direct database access from TPL Tables.  It eliminates the need for you to first extract the data from the database before creating tables.  You do not need to know SQL commands, because TPL Tables automatically generates the required commands and extracts only the data it needs.  TPL-SQL works via ODBC to access databases for which you have ODBC drivers.  Some examples are SAS, Sybase, MS Access and SQL Server.  The TPL Codebook Builder makes use of the data descriptions stored in the database to help you build a TPL codebook (data description) interactively.  

The BLS has three training rooms in the Postal Square Building (PSB), each of which is equipped with Dell Pentium desktop computers for up to eighteen students.  Classes will have a minimum of 8 students and the training will be conducted on-site in the PSB.  The vendor will provide all services associated with delivering quality training for system developers, analysts, computer specialists, end-users, managers, and project leaders who require a comprehensive understanding of the subject material.  The training is to provide participants with new capabilities to significantly improve the way complex systems are analyzed, designed, developed, and implemented.  Offerors must be able to document instructor qualifications and experience in presenting the training described in this announcement.  

Any questions concerning the training in this announcement must be received by 3:00 p.m. on January 13.  Proposals complete with pricing must be received by 3:00 p.m. on January 21.  U.S. Postal Service deliveries to the PSB may be delayed due to special processing requirements.  To ensure on-time arrival, all submissions should be transmitted by fax or by e mail to the contacts listed below.  Offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database to be considered for award.  All correspondence must reference this FedBizOpps solicitation number.

<DESC>In accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration's Acquisition Management System (AMS) paragraph 3.2.1.3.12 this announcement is being posted. Based on rationale identified in the Federal Aviation Administration's AMS paragraph 3.2.2.4 it has been determined to be in the best interest of the FAA to increase the quantity of 405 Precision Aeronautical Surveys which can be ordered under Contract DTFA01-01-C-00033 with Advanced Navigation and Positioning Corporation (ANPC). Contract DTFA01-01-C-00033 provides for a quantity of up to 25 Part 405 Precision Aeronautical Surveys.  This quantity was based on the number of locations identified by Congress for consideration of Transponder Landing Systems (TLS) installation.  Each of these sites require evaluation for survey requirements. Since the award of the contract to ANPC, Congress has added 41 additional sites for possible TLS installation.  This additional quantity has far exceeded the originally anticipated potential increase in the number of TLS sites.  Furthermore, the FY05 congressional language provides for study and consideration of alternate methodologies.  This further increases the need for surveys.   It is the intent of the Federal Aviation Administration to increase from a maximum of 25 optional surveys to a maximum quantity of 75 optional Part 405 Surveys on contract DTFA01-01-C-00033.  ANPC will be limited to performing such surveys on recommended Transponder Landing System sites.

<DESC>DTFH71-05-R-00013

Qualification Statements from all business concerns will be accepted for the George Washington Memorial Parkway Project PLH-GWMP 1A97.

The project consists of the rehabilitation of the George Washington Memorial Parkway (GWMP) from Interstate 395 to the Columbia Island Marina entrance in Arlington County, Virginia and the District of Columbia.  This work will include the replacement of the Humpback Bridge, construction of an acceleration lane, asphalt pavement removal and reconstruction through the project limits, realignment of portions of the Mount Vernon Trail (multi-use), construction of pedestrian underpasses, and other miscellaneous work.

All roadways, trails, and waterways within the project limits must remain open to vehicle, bicycle, boat, and pedestrian traffic during construction. Access must be maintained to the Columbia Island Marina during construction.  Specified horizontal and vertical clearances at the bridge site must be maintained for boat traffic in the vicinity of the Columbia Island Marina throughout construction.  Due to the extremely high volume of traffic using the GWMP and the Mount Vernon Trail and the need for the traffic control to minimize delays and impacts to the traveling public, rush-hour time restrictions and weekend work will be used on this project.

The existing Humpback Bridge carries the GWMP over the Boundary Channel and is a stone-faced, arch shaped concrete structure.  The existing bridge’s width varies from 72 feet to 73 feet, measured from face-to-face of the stone parapets, and has a length of 244 feet.  The bridge accommodates two 14-foot northbound lanes and two 14-foot southbound lanes, separated by a 4-foot median.  The Mount Vernon Trail, which varies from 6’-0” to 6’-6” in width, runs adjacent to the northbound lanes, and a similarly varying width sidewalk is located adjacent to the southbound lanes.

The existing 70-year-old bridge will be removed and replaced with a new structure similar in appearance to the existing structure. The existing architectural features of the Humpback Bridge are of a historic nature and will be incorporated into the new design.  The proposed bridge will carry three northbound lanes, two southbound lanes, and a multi-use trail.  The additional northbound lane is the proposed acceleration lane for the Southbound I-395 to Northbound GWMP ramp.  In addition, the proposed bridge will accommodate open bank-side pedestrian underpasses north and south of the Boundary Channel, to connect the Mount Vernon Trail with the west side of the GWMP and to provide access to the Columbia Island Marina.

The existing asphalt concrete pavement on GWMP will be reconstructed between I-395 and the Columbia Island Marina Entrance and will include changes to the vertical alignment on the bridge approaches.  This will require regrading the Southbound I-395 to Northbound GWMP ramp and the Southbound GWMP to Northbound I-395 ramp to match the new vertical alignment.

Northbound GWMP will be widened to provide an acceleration lane for the Southbound I-395 to Northbound GWMP ramp.  This acceleration lane will extend across the Humpback Bridge.

At the Columbia Island Marina Entrance, the median opening will be closed off to prohibit left turns at the Marina Entrance.  The existing median will be replaced with landscaping.  The pedestrian crosswalk and associated concrete sidewalk north of the entrance will be removed.  Also, the existing Navy-Marine Memorial/Lady Bird Johnson parking area east of the GWMP will be removed and restored to match the surrounding terrain.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the sam relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>NOTE ATTACHMENTS WILL BE UPLOADED SEPARATELY. THE SYNOPSIS WILL ALSO BE RELOADED IN EASY TO READ FORMAT.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCUREMENT
The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) anticipates a requirement for the development and trial deployment of prototype devices for the purpose of rapid, discreet and safe screening of persons at airport and other transportation venue checkpoints. The effort will provide an automated detection capability for detecting explosives on hands, shoes, torso and/or documents without the need for an operator.  TSA intends to procure three units as part of the basic effort. The first prototype (AFL-1) will result in an interim or initial design for airport data collection starting about 6 months after contract award followed by two fully compliant designs (AFL-2) for piloting about 12 months after contract award.  A training syllabus for the prototype devices would also be required approximately 12 months after contract award.  It is expected that an option for Piloting and Field Support services will extend the basic period of performance by 4 months to include installation, maintenance and site services.   Since this is considered a development effort, the TSA plans to acquire a technical data package with Government Purpose rights, at a minimum. The Period of Performance of total effort, including options is approximately16 months. 

Note that this is not a formal request for proposal.  TSA will not reimburse any preparation costs associated with responses to this announcement.

The following attachments are available under this announcement, as described below:

Attachment 1: Clearance Sponsorship Form
Attachment 2: Non-Disclosure Statement

SECURITY REQUIREMENTS
The effort will require Contractors to have a CONFIDENTIAL facility and level of safeguarding clearance in accordance with the DD254.  Since the requirement is classified, the Contractor shall be a participant in the National Industrial Security Program and have a Confidential Facility Clearance at time of proposal submission. Those companies who do not currently possess a facility clearance may complete the attached sponsorship form (ATTACHMENT 1 to this synopsis) to be submitted to Mr. Tom Jerdan at Transportation Security Laboratory, TSL-400, Building 315, Atlantic City International Airport, NJ  08405 via email at Thomas.jerdan@dhs.gov or via fax at (609)-383-1973. Note that TSA is not responsible for granting clearances. The Defense Security Service administers that process.

NONDISCLOSURE STATEMENT ATTACHMENT 2
Since the unclassified Technical Requirement Document (TRD) for this effort is “For Official Use Only,” the individual who is reviewing the unclassified TRD must sign the attached Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) and fax it back by 5:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time,  9 May 2005 to the ATTN of Ms. Sheila Roche at 571-227-1372. That individual will be responsible for ensuring that other people in the company that read the TRD follow the same requirements as stated in the NDA.  Those individuals who have signed a NDA will be emailed the unclassified TRD at a date to be determined, but prior to the Industry Day.  The classified TRD will be provided after release of the RFP only to those companies who have the proper clearances.

INDUSTRY DAY
Prior to the release of the RFP, it is anticipated that an industry day will be held at the Transportation Security Laboratory, William J. Hughes Technical Center, Atlantic City, NJ, for one day, sometime during the week of May 16th.  A separate announcement will be published in www.fedbizopps providing details. Those companies wishing to attend the industry day shall submit their visit request to Mr. Tom Jerdan at 609-383-1973 by 5:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time 9 May 2005.  During the industry day, companies may ask questions concerning the unclassified TRD and the procurement process. After the industry day, the RFP will be provided directly to the interested parties along with answers to questions posed at the industry day.

CUTOFF FOR SUBMISSION OF INTEREST
Interested Parties who wish to participate in the effort shall contact Ms. Sheila Roche via email at Sheila.Roche@dhs.gov by 5:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, 9 May 2005 and provide the following on a single page (8 ½ X 11): 

Name of company, Point of Contact, Address, Email address, phone and fax number, CAGE Code, level of facility clearance information, and applicable quality assurance information (i.e. ISO 9001 or equivalent). Please also indicate whether your company plans to attend the industry day. 

After the cutoff date, the Government reserves the right not to consider additional companies for the balance of the procurement process. The RFP and any associated amendments will only be provided to the interested parties.

<RESPDATE>010405
<CONTACT>Mary Hines  850-235-5389 , or Contracting Officer Tammy Bair at 850-636-6115.
<DESC>This announcement constitutes notification of  actions for both N61331-05-R-0010 and N61331-05-R-0011. The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City, FL intends to award a sole source cost plus fixed fee contract to Northrop Grumman Corporation, Airborne Ground Surveillance and Battle Management Systems Integrated Systems Division, Melbourne, FL for the first lot of four (4) low rate initial production (LRIP) AN/AES-1 Airborne Laser Mine Detection System (ALMDS) (Solicitation No. N61331-05-R-0010). Additionally, after successful delivery of the first LRIP lot, the Government intends award a follow-on separate firm fixed price contract for the second LRIP lot of four (4) systems (Solicitation No. N61331-05-R-0011). The ALMDS is a LIDAR Airborne Mine Countermeasures (AMCM) high area coverage system that detects, classifies, and localizes floating and near-surface moored sea mines.  The system represents a capability that does not exist in the current Mine Countermeasures!  (MCM) inventory. This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons.  (a) This acquisition implements the U.S. Navys acquisition strategy as documented in the Single Acquisition Management Plan (SAMP) No. 0001-02-PMS 210, Revision 1 approved by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development, and Acquisition (ASN(RD&A)) on 09 June 2003. The SAMP states that LRIP quantities will be acquired sole source from the system developer. (b) Northrop Grumman Corporation is and has been the sole developer of the AN/AES-1 ALMDS system since the competitive award of the SD&D phase contract. There have been no other contractual actions related to the SD&D phase awarded since this contract. Given the complexity of the system and the level of system knowledge required to work through the SD&D it is reasonable to assert that Northrop Grumman is the only source possessing the expertise, internal technical data, equipment, and experienced personnel necessary to successfully produce the systems. (c) This is a follow-on contract for the production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, within the exact meaning of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii). Use of any other vendor would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that, given the limited number of systems being acquired, is not expected to be recovered through competition. There are no other possible sources that can satisfy this requirement without significant additional cost, significant schedule risk and significant technical risk to the Government.  The systems will be delivered to the Naval Support Activity - Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018. Delivery will be sixteen (16) months after award of each contract.  The NACIS is 332999, Small Business Size Standard is 500 employees, the FSC is 1287. Note 22 applies. Contract Specialist: Mary F. Hines, Code XPS1, NSWC-PC, 100 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, Fl 32407-7001, email – mary.f.hines@navy.mil.

Four discreet components, including the demolition of the existing facilities on administrative land owned by the National Park Service in Kotzebue, Alaska; preparation of the finish subgrade of a site designated for the proposed Northwest Arctic Heritage Center and a site designated for a new Maintenance Building in Kotzebue; installation of new water, sewer, and storm culvert pipe on both sites; and installation of thermosyphon piling per proposed building foundation design for both facilities. B.  Deconstruction and Demolition: The work comprises removal of existing structures on the site designated for the proposed Northwest Arctic Heritage Center.  The existing multi-purpose facility has building materials within the structure that, providing they meet qualitative standards, will be reused/recycled.  Materials not accepted for this purpose are to be properly disposed by the Contractor.  Appropriate disposal within the community may include salvage for re-sale or disbursement to interested parties to encourage sustainable practices. C.  Earthwork, Grading, and Drainage: The existing site designated for the proposed Northwest Arctic Heritage Center has extensive drainage deficiencies.  As a requirement to successfully install new piles, earthwork, grading and drainage will have to be completed in order to protect the permafrost soils from ponding in and around the building foundation system, including installation of culverts. D.  Utility Extension: The water and sewer service for the Northwest Arctic Heritage Center site shall be stubbed in from Second Avenue prior to a city street paving project scheduled for 2006.

<DESC>The purpose of this synopsis is to amend previously synopsized synopsis/solicitation number NHLBI-RR-P-05-027 for “Medical Officer Services for General Clinical Research Centers (GCRCs) Portfolio Oversight,” published December 15, 2004.  The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), for the National Center for Research Resources (NCRR), intends to procure the services of a contractor to perform as a medical consultant to guide, assist, and facilitate NCRR in the oversight of a portfolio of sixteen (16) grants for General Clinical Research Centers (GCRCs), and grants for the clinical research resource programs specified below, for the Division for Clinical Research Resources at the NCRR.  The assigned portfolio consists of sixteen (16) grants for General Clinical Research Centers (GCRCs) that support clinical research resources, five (5) grants for National Gene Vector Laboratories (NGVLs) that provide gene vectors for gene therapy and gene transfer experiments, ten (10) grants for Islet Cell Resource Centers (ICRCs) that provide transplantation grade islets for basic and clinical research studies, and a grant for the National Disease Research Interchange (NDRI) that supports human specimen collection services.  The Statement of Work is as follows:  Contractor Requirements:  Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish the materials, equipment, and facilities not otherwise provided by the Government under the terms of the contract.  Specifically, the Contractor shall follow the scientific progress and financial status of each of the grants within the assigned portfolio.  The Contractor shall consult with grantee organizations, review annual progress reports, attend programmatic site visits, provide recommendations to the Division Director, Division for Clinical Research Resources, on budgetary and administrative matters, which may lead to consolidation and/or the reorganization or significant administrative changes within these clinical research resource programs.  The Contractor shall also review policy documents in an effort to facilitate the evaluation of the programs supported by these grants.    

The National Gene Vector Laboratories (NGVLs) generate Good Manufacturing Practice-grade materials for use in gene transfer protocols at no cost to clinical researchers throughout the United States.  The Contractor shall provide oversight management responsibility for the cooperative agreement grants supporting this program.  The Contractor shall facilitate expansion of the activity of the NGVLs within the scope of the grants, to include toxicology support.  In addition, the Contractor shall facilitate the availability of the NGVL data, as appropriate, to the entire research community through the grantee’s web site, in an effort to decrease reduplication of effort by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) grantees.  The Contractor shall also be responsible for monitoring and providing advice to the Associate Director for Clinical Research Resources on the grantees’ management of the NGVL repository.                                              

The Contractor shall also provide oversight for the cooperative agreement grants that support the Islet Cell Resource Centers (ICRCs) consortium, with funds from the NCRR and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.  The mission of the ICRC is to allow optimization and sharing of the procedures necessary for collection of functional human islet cells from cadaveric pancreata and their subsequent transplantation into patients afflicted with type 1 diabetes.  Such efforts are critical in view of the limited supply of human pancreata.  The  ICRC grantees shall continue to develop Good Manufacturing Practice criteria to ensure that the islets generated will be of consistent transplant quality.  The Contractor shall also provide oversight and participation in a joint Steering Committee, established to review and approve site-specific protocols for transplantation of cells into eligible patients. 

The National Disease Research Interchange (NDRI), a not-for-profit organization, is supported by a cooperative agreement grant managed by the NCRR.  The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS), the National Eye Institute (NEI), the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), and the Office of Rare Diseases also contribute funds through this grant.  The mission of the NDRI is to identify, obtain, and distribute human tissues and organs to investigators for use in basic research studies.  The Contractor shall provide oversight and make recommendations to the Associate Director for Clinical Research Resources in support of the cooperative agreement.

Period of performance:  The proposed period of performance for these services will consist of one twelve (12) month basic contract period, and shall include options to renew for four (4) successive twelve (12) month periods.  It is anticipated that work, under the proposed contract, will begin on or about July 1, 2005.  Level of effort:  The level of effort required is based on an hourly rate for the services of a Medical Officer to provide oversight for a portfolio of clinical research resource programs.  The number of hours required to perform these services are estimated not-to-exceed 2,080 over a twelve (12) month period.  This equates to a full-time work schedule of 40 hours per week.  The total effort, in labor hours, will be reported monthly and serve as the basis for payment.                             

A noncompetitive award is contemplated for this requirement to Richard A. Knazek, M.D., 18330 New Cut Road, Mount Airy, Maryland  21771.  The noncompetitive determination is based upon FAR Part 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This is a total small business set-aside requirement.  Interested parties are requested to review the Statement of Work and submit a response which includes a loaded hourly rate, estimate of travel, and other direct costs, Curriculum Vitae, at least three (3) references documenting similar past performance experiences, and a technical approach of how the work will be performed.

<DESC>NASA's Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD) is openly soliciting inputs and ideas for its Integrated Master Planning and Integrated Master Scheduling  (IMP/IMS) tool for program and project management.  This tool will be used to support a robust and comprehensive systems engineering and integration process in the ESMD, and provide the capability to develop and produce a variety of Directorate schedules.  Specifically, this tool will support ESMD efforts to pursue capabilities and supporting research and technologies that will enable sustainable and affordable human and robotic exploration.  The Exploration Systems Mission Directorate creates capabilities and supporting research and technologies that will enable, sustainable and affordable human and robotic exploration. The ESMD organization consists of six offices that support management of critical Directorate-level functions inclusive of administration, systems engineering and integration, and risk management.  These offices are the formal interfaces to other Agency Mission Directorates and Functional Offices in addition to external stakeholders and communities.  The Directorate is supported by three divisions:  Acquisition/Mission Support, Development Programs, and Requirements Formulation.  Further more, the Development Programs Division is organized into a hierarchy of hardware, research and technology development entities.  It is the desire of ESMD management to provide established and consistent business practices and tools for use by these organizations. ESMD organizations utilize an Integrated Collaborative Environment (ICE).  ICE is a web-centric environment which will be used by industry, academia and government for sharing, collaborating, integrating, accessing and controlling management information and product data definition for all ESMD products and data.  The scope of ICE includes all program and product information, including: all requirements, schedule, risk and configuration management information to all engineering design, manufacturing, analysis and test data. In addition to ICE being the authoritative source of information, ICE is implemented using collection of Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) applications which support program and project management requirements for ESMD. The IMP/IMS tool will be integrated into ICE. Key areas that the IMP/IMS tool will support include: supporting Directorate, program and project Integrated Master Planning and Scheduling to build and track schedule activities; provide historical tracking of changes to a baseline plan against actual status; assignment, load and leveling of resources; analysis of project progress, critical path; weekly status reporting; and integration with other ICE Program/Project management tools. This tool must enable the engagement of a large multi-organization, distributed team that will be working in the previously mentioned key areas. This RFI seeks comments in several requirements focus areas, as listed in the attachment, specifically addressing the reasonableness and comprehensiveness of the requirements. The method in which the requirements are addressed and satisfied should be provided.  Input is invited for any/all of the 5 functional requirements focus areas discussed herein.  All responses shall be delivered in an electronic format using Microsoft Word Table or Microsoft Excel worksheet format.  See Attachment 1 for a template of the expected response format.  Supplemental information may be provided in a narrative format using Microsoft Word with graphics, as appropriate. Font size should be no smaller than 12 point. The total response should be no more than 8 pages in length including supporting graphics and additional backup material. Input should include the following as a minimum: For submitted responses, include: •	Submitter name, phone, email, and mail address •	Tool description •	Tool capabilities •	Identify where the tool has been successfully deployed and implemented to support a similar organization and scope of capability requested in this RFI Key words that serve to identify important elements of the input should be highlighted for quick visibility. NASA reserves the right to use submitted responses for NASA internal planning. Although details of responses are meant only for NASA use, response submitters should not submit proprietary material.  This RFI is for information and planning purposes and to allow industry the opportunity to verify reasonableness and feasibility of the requirement, as well as promote competition.  No procurement is planned as a direct result of this Request for Information. This is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation. Failure to respond to this RFI does not mean that a firm cannot respond to a solicitation at a later date.  No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service. It is the potential offeror’s responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.  Failure to respond to this synopsis does not mean that a firm cannot respond to a solicitation at a later date.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH has a requirement to establish three to four Simian Vaccine Evaluation Units for evaluation of SIV and HIV vaccine approaches in support of preclinical AIDS vaccine research and development.  For this project, the Division of AIDS, NIAID, is seeking organizations with the technical expertise and facilities needed to house 100 – 300 nonhuman primates in BSL2 and BSL2/3 containment facilities and to conduct preclinical evaluations of the immunogenicity and efficacy of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and HIV candidate vaccines in the nonhuman primates.  Studies are conducted at the initiation of the NIAID, and vaccines to be evaluated are selected by NIAID.  The Contractor will provide the nonhuman primates and the scientific and technical expertise necessary to conduct preliminary studies on new vaccines, conduct larger-scale studies on vaccines that have already demonstrated promise, evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of candidate HIV vaccines in anticipation of Phase II human clinical trials, and conduct comparative studies on vaccines and/or adjuvants from multiple sources.  The SVEUs may also conduct studies with passively administered vaccines.  The SVEUs are expected to provide non-human primates for the studies, immunize animals with candidate vaccines, conduct initial assessments of immune responses, challenge the non-human primates with infectious virus, and determine whether or not the animals become infected.  The SVEUs also conduct in vivo titrations of virus challenge stocks and may conduct microbicide studies to evaluate the ability of topically administered microbicides and other antiviral substances to block infection of non-human primates with virus administered vaginally or by other mucosal routes.  The proposed contracts will continue the work of the current SVEUs.  It is anticipated that three to four (3-4) completion type contracts will be awarded as a result of this solicitation.  This project will take approximately seven years to complete.  It is anticipated that three to four cost reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded, each with a period of seven (7) years, beginning approximately May 8, 2006.  RFP NIH-NIAID-DAIDS-06-15 will be available electronically on or about May 6, 2005 with a closing date tentatively set for August 8, 2005, and may be accessed through the NIAID Contract Management Program (CMP) Home Page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract -- and will also be posted on FedBizOps.  Any responsible Offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government.  This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 54   In accordance with FAR subpart 13.106(b), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) seeks to award professional services on a sole source basis to Professor Delbert J. Eatough of Brigham Young University based on the following circumstances outlined below that only one source is reasonably available.  This requirement is to provide professional services for the project titled, "Measurement of Nonvolatile and Semivolatile Components of Secondary Organic Particulate Matter".  This project deals with Particulate Matter (PM) that is suspended in the atmosphere which  consists of a nonvolatile (NV) component and a semivolatile (SV) component.  The contractor will have to possess an instrument that is capable of measuring both the nonvolatile and semivolatile components of organic PM and bring it to the EPA: set up the instrument so that it can sample from the  EPA smog chamber, train the EPA staff in operation of the instrument; leave the instrument for the EPA staff to operate for 2 to 3 weeks; reduce and quality assure the data; provide EPA with a data report; and provide EPA with an interpretive report that can form the basis of an EPA report or  journal article.    The U.S. EPA-National Center for Environmental Assessment Office in Cincinnati, Ohio is only aware of one source that is reasonably available for this project.  EPA requires a device that measures the SV and NV components of Organic Carbon (OC) PM so that they can compare the  new data to other measurements of OC in particles generated in the EPA smog chamber.  Professor Eatough and coworkers have developed a new two channel technique for measuring both the SV and NV components of OC PM.  Professor Eatough's group at BYU is the only research group that has the necessary  equipment; staff trained and experienced in use of the equipment, and has demonstrated competence in measuring SV PM and in understanding the role of SV PM in air pollution.  The unique experience and capabilities that Professor Eatough and his group at BYU possess are essential to the timely  completion of this project.   Interested parties who feel that they possess the capabilities to perform the services described above, should provide a capabilities statement demonstrating how their qualifications, experience, and ability to provide a device that measure SV and NV components of OC  PM fulfill the government's requirement.  A statement of work and any other applicable documents will be made available upon request.  The information received in response to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.   Please send your documentation to Angela Schopler at the office identified above, by fax (513)487-2109 or by e-mail at schopler.angela@epa.gov which establishes that their specifications or qualifications meet the EPA's requirement.  Documentation must be received within fifteen (15) days after the  date of publication of this synopsis to be considered by the EPA.  A determination by the EPA not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.

This position requires a medical expert who can assist the Division of Nursing Homes in the development of detailed interpretive guidance revisions for surveyors, as well as medical and pharmacy issues concerning geriatric residents of nursing homes.  Dr. Levenson is a nationally-recognized expert in geriatric medical direction in nursing homes, having written several key textbooks for this specialty.  He has an uncommon understanding of the CMS survey process, regulations, and guidelines for long term care, through his long participation in expert panels and stakeholder groups with CMS, as a national representative of the American Medical Directors Association, of which he is the current President Elect.  He has been working as a consultant to the Division for the past few years on the survey guidance revision project, through previous and current procurements.  He has also been working on providing consultation on emergent medical issues before the Division, and through this effort, he has gained significant understanding of the surveyor role in evaluating facility compliance with the long term care requirements, and their need to evaluate medical decisions of facility physicians and medical directors.  He has also assisted the Division in the past with surveyor training on drug issues, which was extremely well received.  All responsible sources may submit capability statements in consideration to the Agency at the above address.  In addition, all contractors must be registered with the Central Contractors Registration System (CCR) at www.ccr.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The announcement is revised to include the following requirements:  The contract may be awarded with two (2) one-year options.  Continuity of analyses is essential as consistency of results is needed to expedite regional comparisons.  The primary objectives of this paleolimnological study are: 1) a historical quantitative reconstruction of the ecological impacts of damming and water level manipulation on the Rainy-Namakan Reservoir system over the last 100 years, 2) a historical reconstruction of coincident environmental changes in an upstream "control" large lake system, Lac La Croix, and 3) the determination of regional and scale-dependent pre-damming/pre-European "natural" lake conditions and historical lake response variability during the last 500 years due to catchment history, lake ontogeny, and climate change. Completion of this project shall require the collection of four approximately 1.5 m sediment cores from the Rainy Lake-Namakan Reservoir system and one core from Lac La Croix, which is located upstream in the watershed.  At least 40 sections from each core (between 200 and 300 samples total) shall be analyzed for siliceous microfossil remains (diatom valves and chrysopyte cysts) for approximately decadal resolution of environmental change during the last 400 to 500 years. Siliceous remains along one or more random microslide transects shall be counted on a research grade microscope using full oil immersion optics capable of N.A. 1.4 and 1250x until a total of 400 diatom microfossils is reached. Regional floras and primary literature shall be used to achieve consistency in the identification of diatoms.  The contractor shall use weighted average calibration and reconstruction to infer historical water column total phosphorus concentrations, alkalinity (as ANC), and dissolved organic carbon (as water color).  Transfer functions of diatom species environmental optima and tolerances developed from existing training sets of diatom assemblages and selected environmental parameters from modern lakes in Minnesota and northwestern Ontario shall be applied to historical diatom assemblages in sediment cores to reconstruct specific environmental variables.

The NAICS Code is 541330. A-E services are required for the development of plans, specifications and cost estimates suitable for bidding and repairs, renovations, alterations, upgrades, possible replacement (new construction), and associated demolition work for various projects primarily at Seymour Johnson AFB and occasionally at Dare County Bomb Range and Fort Fisher in NC.  A-E services for these projects will be accomplished under Task Orders written against the IDIQ contract. Construction cost ranges for these projects vary; however, it is not contemplated that the cost range for any individual job will be between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000. The selected A-E firm(s) will be required to participate in an orientation, scope of work and site visit meetings (when requested) within 7 calendar days after receiving the request for proposal for a project. The maximum monetary limit for all task orders under this contract shall not exceed $2,250,000 with the maximum task order amount of $299,000. The guaranteed minimum for the IDIQ contract is $10,000 for the life of the contract.

Field surveying, landscaping design, and architectural rendering capabilities may be required. Familiarity with sustainable design through an integrated design approach is required.  Familiarity with English and metric system of measurements is required.

Contracted services include, but are not limited to, providing for the professional examinations as listed above, along with personnel management, information technology capable of receiving and sending data electronically to a web based, hypertext protocol secure (https) client server, and the ability to maintain a database of scheduled applicants, and be able to prepare and provide management reports.  The approximate number of examinations required annually for this effort is 20,000 (1,667 per month), and may require as many as 36,000 (3,000 per month).  However, these numbers are only approximate based on historical data, and anticipated future needs, and are not to be considered exact or binding.  

Multiple awards are not being considered.  A source selection will be conducted in accordance with AFFARS 5315.3 at The United States Air Force Academy, CO.  A Request For Proposal will be released, no sooner than 15 calendar days after this notice is posted, on the worldwide web at the following website:  http://www.fedbizopps.gov/ (FedBizOpps).

Please note that all prospective contractors must register with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database to contract with the Department of Defense.  To learn more about this CCR requirement and how to register, please visit the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov/ or call 1-888-227-2423.  
NOTE: Contractors are required to submit standard Representations and Certifications on-line.  A new Federal Integrated Acquisition Environment (IAE) initiative called the ‘Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA)’ is being implemented.  ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the representations and certifications required by the Federal Acquisition Regulations found in solicitations.  However, agency specific provisions and solicitation specific provisions not included in ORCA will still have to be included in solicitations.

HSAR 3009.104-75 PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES
[DEC 2003] 

(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause.  The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 

(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 

(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. 

(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

<DESC>This synopsis is hereby modified as follows:
The Government intends to negotiate an Indefinite Delivery, Requirements type contract with firm fixed prices for drink and snack vending machines and vending machine accessories in support of the Navy Exchange Service Command (NEXCOM) Ships Store Program, Virginia Beach, VA.  The Government intends to use these items onboard the Naval Ships.  The Contractor shall provide instructional video training tapes upon request from individual ships and NEXCOM Fleet Assistance Team offices.  Training for deploying battlegroups is to be provided by the contractor at no charge when arranged by NEXCOM Fleet Assistance Teams.  Onboard training is to be provided during service calls per individual ships' request. Due to shipboard drink and snack vending machines and vending machine accessories being in operation around the world, it is frequently difficult for ships to reach the contractor for repair and maintenance assistance.  Therefore, it is desired that the contractor provide the following minimum access: the Contractor must provide information on all equipment, specifications, brochures, replacement part prices, etc. available via the world wide web, response to email requests for assistance, and toll free telephone number(s) from at least the United States, Bahrain, Italy, Japan, Spain and United Kingdom. The Contractor shall offer repair and maintenance services to every major world wide port area. The period of performance is for one base year with four (4), twelve-month option periods.  This procurement is set aside for small businesses.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 423440.  The solicitation number for this procurement is N00189-05-T-0221 and will be released on or about 25 April 2005.  Responses to this solicitation are due back by 10 May 2005, 4:30 p.m.  All quotes will be evaluated based on technical, past performance, and price.  Technical proposals will be evaluated Pass/Fail. Past performance is more important than price.  Potential offerors are hereby notified that the solicitation and subsequent amendments to the solicitation will only be available by downloading the documents at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  This office will no longer issue hard copy solicitations.  By submitting a proposal, the offeror will be self-certifying that neither the requestor nor the principal corporate officials and owners are currently suspended, debarred or otherwise ineligible to receive contracts from any Federal Agency. Failure to do so may represent grounds for refusing to accept the proposal. By submission of a proposal, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee must be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation, except for awards to foreign vendors for work to be performed outside the United States.  Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award. Offerors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at http://ccr.edi.disa.mil.

<DESC>The original posting for this procurement notified the public that the requirement would be solicited as a total small business set-aside.  This would require the inclusion of FAR Clause 52.219-14 "Limitations on Subcontracting," which requires the successful small business offeror to complete at least 50% of the work themself.  After speaking with several interested small businesses, it does not appear likely that a small business would be capable of fulfilling the limitation on subcontracting requirement.  Therefore, this procurement will now be solicited under full and open competition procedures.

<DESC>This is a modification to synopsis N61331-05-R-0010 which was published on or about 03 Nov 04.  There are two changes to the original synopsis, they are:  (1) The second LRIP is now an option to the subject solicitation and (2) an option for two (2) trainers is added. The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City, FL intends to award a sole source cost-plus-fixed-fee contract to Northrop Grumman Corporation, Airborne Ground Surveillance and Battle Management Systems Integrated Systems Division, Melbourne, FL for the first lot of three (3) low rate initial production (LRIP) AN/AES-1 Airborne Laser Mine Detection System (ALMDS) with a firm-fixed price option for a second lot of six (6) systems and an option for two (2) trainers. The ALMDS is a LIDAR Airborne Mine Countermeasures (AMCM) high area coverage system that detects, classifies, and localizes floating and near-surface moored sea mines.  The system represents a capability that does not exist in the current Mine Co! untermeasures (MCM) inventory. This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons.  (a) This acquisition implements the U.S. Navys acquisition strategy as documented in the Single Acquisition Management Plan (SAMP) No. 0001-02-PMS 210, Revision 1 approved by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development, and Acquisition (ASN(RD&A)) on 09 June 2003. The SAMP states that LRIP quantities will be acquired sole source from the system developer. (b) Northrop Grumman Corporation is and has been the sole developer of the AN/AES-1 ALMDS system since the competitive award of the SD&D phase contract. There have been no other contractual actions related to the SD&D phase awarded since this contract. Given the complexity of the system and the level of system knowledge required to work through the SD&D it is reasonable to assert that Northrop Grumman is the only source possessing the expertise, internal technical data, equipment, and experienced personnel necessary to successfully produce the systems. (c) This is a follow-on contract for the production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, within the exact meaning of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii). Use of any other vendor would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that, given the limited number of systems being acquired, is not expected to be recovered through competition. There are no other possible sources that can satisfy this requirement without significant additional cost, significant schedule risk and significant technical risk to the Government.  The systems will be delivered to the Naval Support Activity - Panama City, Receiving Officer, Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018. Delivery will be sixteen (16) months after award of contract.  The NACIS is 332999, Small Business Size Standard is 500 employees, the FSC is 1287. Contract Specialist: Mary F. Hines, Code XPS1, NSWC-PC, 100 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, Fl 32407-7001, mary.f.hines@navy.mil. Note 22 applies.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) Number HHSF200601 on Active Surveillance Programs in the United States for the Identification of Clinically Serious Adverse Events Associated with Medical Products 

The following questions were received on this RFI. They are reprinted below in this modification. The due date is also extended until 6/10/2005:

Question #1: The RFI asks for "cost estimate" Is this a budget? 
Answer:  FDA is requesting a price schedule for accessing and/or collaborating on the proposed an active surveillance system.

Question #2: Are you looking for "a comprehensive review on surveillance systems"? 
Answer: No... only descriptions of specific systems.



BACKGROUND 

A vital part of FDA and CDER’s mission is to protect the public health.  The Office of Drug Safety (ODS) contributes to this effort by evaluating drug risks and promoting the safe use of drugs by the American people.  In 1999, the Task Force on Risk Management’s “Report to the FDA Commissioner” and the HHS Office of the Inspector General’s “Report to the FDA Commissioner” both identified the need for greater post marketing pharmacovigilance for prescription drugs.  In response to these reports, FDA devoted greater resources to the area of post marketing safety and has expanded the roles and responsibilities of ODS within CDER. 

The statutory provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act as amended by the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act (FDAMA, Section 406), Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 310.305, and Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 314.80 require FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of regulated marketed products. 

FDA currently has several tools available to address post marketing safety issues.  These tools include a passive surveillance system for adverse events related to drug therapy; several complementary drug utilization databases; and (historically) indirect access to US claims-based health encounter data for pharmacoepidemiology studies. Passive reporting systems provide limited information, though, suffering from underreporting, attribution problems, reporting biases, and a lack of denominator information. To strengthen and complement these resources, FDA seeks information related to “active surveillance” activities in the US, either ongoing or proposed.  

DEFINITION OF ACTIVE SURVEILLANCE

Active surveillance has been defined by some as regular periodic collection of case reports from health care providers or facilities; in contrast with passive surveillance which refers to case reports provided at the discretion of the health care provider .  Due to the complexity of drug safety surveillance, FDA would like to broaden this concept to include data collected from other sources, in addition to traditional case reports used in other types of public health surveillance.  Surveillance programs can focus on certain events (or outcomes) or on certain drugs of interest.   

There are at least three strategies that can be used for the active surveillance of drug-related adverse events.  Drug-based surveillance systems look at large numbers of patients exposed to new molecular entities (NMEs) after their launch for all or specified adverse events.  This type of system can also examine the utilization of drugs and modes of clinical practice.  Setting-based surveillance systems are set up in hospitals or emergency rooms and capture all or specified adverse events that occur in relation to drug use and present for treatment at these facilities.  Disease-based systems set up comprehensive disease-specific registries for selected drug-induced diseases. Each methodology is useful, so the ideal program could include more than one methodology.

HISTORY OF ACTIVE SURVEILLANCE

In the late 1960s, FDA initiated a jointly funded active surveillance program with NIH and a large health maintenance organization to develop a medical record linkage system.  This system was the first attempt at linking scanned forms from doctor visits, laboratory test information, electronic pharmacy data, and hospitalization information. The effort failed because computer technology was still in its infancy and it was extremely labor intensive (and hence expensive) to enter the information.  In the 1970s, several efforts were made to collect drug exposure information from patients hospitalized for a variety of conditions.  Nurse abstractors reviewed charts at hospitals around the country to identify and interview selected patients about their prescription and nonprescription drug exposure history.  The early programs did not meet the FDA’s needs for a number of reasons including; lack of funding, underdeveloped computer technology, and low yield of new information.  

More recently, other surveillance systems include the Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) funded by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) jointly funded by the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the FDA. Both of these systems collect adverse drug event information from emergency departments in a representative sample of U.S. hospitals and can be used to make national estimates.  DAWN and NEISS are examples of setting-based surveillance systems.  In addition, FDA has co-sponsored pilot development of a drug-based surveillance system which explores the feasibility of using data mining techniques to identify safety signals in automated claims databases.  FDA remains interested in learning about other systems of all three types that might complement these programs.

DESCRIPTION 

This is a Request for Information (RFI) only.  It is not a request for proposal/bid/quotation and does not commit the Government to issue a solicitation, make an award, or pay any costs associated with responding to this announcement. All submitted information shall remain with the Government and will not be returned. 

In general, FDA is interested in,
1)	Systems that can provide any of the following information:
a)	Rapid identification of drug/adverse event associations; 
b)	Systems to actively identify cases of selected adverse events of interest, possibly in relation to specific drugs of interest; these may or may not be automated.  These systems would not necessarily require health care practitioners to make causal attribution of the event to a drug.  Access to medical records by local system personnel (i.e., not FDA), while not mandatory, is highly desirable.
c)	Systems that are able to measure and/or estimate incidence rates based on signals of possible drug safety problems originating from adverse reaction reports received by FDA

2)	Systems that are nationally representative; or at least include a multi center or multi state population or network.  

Specific systems might include,
1)	A  focus on the three strategies listed above, for example, 
a)	Setting-based systems that would  allow FDA to monitor selected health care settings such as acute care hospitals (or specific departments within a hospital, e.g., emergency departments, operating rooms, transplant centers, outpatient clinics, or dialysis services), long-term care facilities (e.g., nursing homes, psychiatric hospitals, or rehabilitation centers), urgent care centers, outpatient surgical centers, freestanding outpatient specialty clinics (e.g., those that treat HIV patients, family planning services), physicians’ offices, etc., for the occurrence of adverse events of interest.
b)	Drug-based systems that would allow identification of all adverse events associated with selected prescription or nonprescription drugs.  Information about patients prescribed these drugs would be used to identify signals of previously unknown adverse events.
c)	Outcome-based systems that would allow identification of specific acute outcomes for which drug therapy is frequently considered as a potential cause, e.g., acute liver failure, rhabdomyolysis, serious blood dyscrasias, serious skin reactions, anaphylaxis, QT prolongation,  GI bleeding.  Other outcomes of interest may be more difficult to ascertain because they occur a long time after the start of drug therapy and may make attribution more difficult.  Examples of these outcomes include congenital anomalies and certain cancers.  
2)	A focus on  particular safety areas that traditionally have been difficult to study, such as, 
a)	Abuse or misuse of prescription drugs that have serious public health consequences  
b)	Drug-related medication errors
c)	Drug-related death surveillance
d)	Pediatric and geriatric  populations

Interested organizations are invited to submit a description of their perspective on existing or potential active surveillance program components and information describing their ability to operationalize those components.  In addition, these submissions should contain cost estimates for FDA to access or develop these systems for day to day use in drug safety surveillance.  Submitted information could include a discussion addressing some or all of the following criteria, described in a comprehensive review on surveillance systems :  

Simplicity
Flexibility
Data Quality
Acceptability
Sensitivity
Positive Predictive Value
Representativeness
Timeliness
Stability

<DESC>This synopsis replaces the synopsis posted on October 15, 2004 due to a change in Contract Specialists/Contracting Officers. This solicitation modifies the list of potential tasks and the selection criteria and requires interested firms to submit their qualifications using only the SF 330 Parts I and II. This applies to firms that have previously responded with their SF 254s and SF 255s as well as those that have not yet responded. Firms that previously responded with their SF 330s do not re-submit. The response date is open and will remain open indefinitely. Note: You will not be notified unless your firm has been selected to perform a task (see below).

In this synopsis, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts (AO) requests submission of SF 330s (only) by Architectural/Engineering firms desiring to be considered for government contracts not to exceed $100,000. The SF 330 information will be compiled and managed in a database by a permanent AO Architect/Engineer Selection Board. Please do not submit any information other than the SF 330 as it will be discarded. Only the SF 330 will be filed and stored, and only information in the SF 330 will be entered in the database and considered for potential tasks. No actual contract documentation or construction administration (or new building designs) will result as part of these broad-based Architectural/Engineering services tasks. Tasks will consist of providing limited assistance to the judiciary and the AO on individual projects, primarily as conducted for the judiciary by the General Services Administration (GSA). Tasks may include, but are not limited to, project-related program and design analysis and evaluation; small scale schematic design; furniture and interiors services; technical document reviews; value engineering services; architectural, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and structural analysis and evaluation; historical preservation studies; courtroom technologies consultation; blast-resistant and security design criteria development; environmental (sick building) testing and analysis; and preparation of other studies and reports to support the judiciary. Potential tasks will be geographically located only throughout the 50 United States and the U.S. Territories. Travel may be, but is not always, required. In no prioritized order of importance, individual tasks will be awarded to firms based on a combination of the following criteria: (1) Past performance on contracts with the judiciary, other government entities, and private industry, in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with the U.S. Courts Design Guide and performance schedules; (2) Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required; (3) Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of required services; (4) Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time; and (5) Staffed location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality. In making the award determination for each task the AO Architect/Engineer Selection Board will rank the firms most qualified to perform the work and provide its list to the Contracting Officer (CO) who will review it, make the final selection list, attempt to negotiate a fair and reasonable price with the firm ranked first and, if successful, award to that firm. If unsuccessful, the CO will attempt to negotiate with the next firm on the list and so forth, until award is made or it is necessary to request an additional listing from the selection board. This process will continue until award is accomplished.

<DESC>Due date for receipt of replies to this RFI is extended to 12:00 PM MST on April 22, 2005. The Tactical Radar System portion of this RFI has been deleted and will be addressed in a separate RFI. The original RFI is modified to read as follows: This i s a Request For Information from U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command and Army Strategic Command (SMDC ARSTRAT). SMDC ARSTRAT G2 Spectral Operations Readiness Center (SORC) requires a system to allow more rapid access to commercial and civil satelli te imagery data. The required system needed consists of providing a Multi-Sensor Virtual Ground Terminal that enables rapid access to commercial and civil satellite imagery data. This would include both optical and Synthetic Aperture RADAR (SAR) data from sensors such as DigitalGlobe's Quickbird and the Canadian RADARSAT satellite. System needs to have a small footprint to allow for flexible positioning for tactical forces around the world. System needs to be expandable to allow inclusion of new satellite s ensors such as DigitalGlobe's Worldview and the Canadian SAR satellite RADARSAT 2. The system will allow the unit to request specific data or automatically receive compressed commercial and or civil imagery over a high bandwidth commercial communication li nk (provided by the unit) and process the data within the area of operations. This is a Request For Information to identify sources interested in supplying the aforesaid system. The following information is provided for planning purposes only and does not constitute a Request For Proposal (RFP) nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach. All interested parties must submit a capability statement that sufficiently describes their qualifications, capabilities, and previous expe rience related to fulfilling similar requirements via email to: george.knowlton@arspace.army.mil 12:00 PM MST on April 22, 2005 will be considered by the government. IMPORTANT!! THE POINT OF CONTACT IS George Knowlton. Capability responses and inquiries wi ll only be accepted electronically by email at: george.knowlton@arspace.army.mil. Pricing information should include all anticipated costs, with recurring and non-recurring costs presented separately, to include set up costs, etc. Capability responses sent  to any other email address will not be accepted. The contractor must forward a point of contact (POC) along with the POC's e-mail address, and phone number. This is a market survey for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Pro posal or as an obligation on the part of the Government. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market survey or otherwise pay for information solicited. Proprietary information is not being solicited; however, if it is sub mitted, it should be appropriately marked. Please submit responses NO LATER THAN APRIL 22, 2005.

<DESC>The USDA, Agricultural Research Service, Clay Center, NE intends to negotiate with IBP-Tyson, Lexington, NE on a sole-source basis for beef cuts as described below to be used in a research project.  Those beef packing plants interested in being considered for this project shall send a qualifications statement by April 25, 2005 to one of the following:  FAX 402/762-4148; E-mail gill@email.marc.usda,gov or mail to USDA, ARS, US Meat Animal Research Center, Attention Carol Gill, Box 166, Clay Center, NE 68933-0166.  The U.S. Meat Animal Research Center (MARC) is seeking a federally-inspected beef processor to participate in a study of the effects of aging on the tenderness of beef top sirloin and clod.  The company must regularly slaughter grain-fed beef and process carcasses into vacuum-packaged boxed beef.  The company must regularly process enough U.S. Choice and U.S. Select carcasses to facilitate the completion of cut selection and fabrication in one day.  The experimental protocol requires obtaining the gluteus medius and triceps brachii from the right side of 300 U.S. Choice and 300 U.S. Select carcasses at 24 to 48 postmortem.  Therefore, the packing company must regularly produce cap-off center-cut, boneless top sirloins (NAMP 184B) and trimmed beef shoulder clods with the infraspinatus removed (modified NAMP 114C).  The packing company must allow MARC personnel access to their facility and provide sufficient space for product tagging between fabrication and vacuum-packaging.  The packing company must have facilities for segregation of the vacuum-packaged cuts into combo bins for immediate transport to the Meat Animal Research Center.  To facilitate completion of the experiment, the plant must be located with 120 miles of Clay Center, Nebraska. Cut selection and procurement will be conducted on June 22nd, 2005.

The rescue hoist system shall automatically stop retracting th e cable at the fully payed-in position and shall automatically reduce the velocity of the retracting cable speed when ten (10) feet of cable remain to be payed in.  The rescue hoist system shall automatically reduce the velocity of the cable when five (5) feet of cable remain to be payed out and shall stop and hold the cable in any position between full-in and full-out when commanded by the pilot or crewmember.  The cable shall be a non-rotating type in accordance with MIL-W-83140.  The initial and final 20  feet of cable shall be permanently colored bright orange to indicate visually the full extension or retraction of the cable.  The rescue hoist system shall reel out and reel in the cable without fouling or kinking and shall raise and lower static and dyna mic loads weighing up to 600 pounds.  The rescue hoist system shall have no less than 250 feet of usable cable and shall lift all loads at a variable speed from zero (0) to no less than 215 feet per minute.  The rescue hoist system shall provide the pilot and the crewmembers the means to cut the hoist cable.  The rescue hoist system shall provide the crewmember with an indication that the electric hoist motor has exceeded temperature safety requirements.  The rescue hoist system shall meet the safety standa rd requirements of MIL-STD-882.  The rescue hoist system operator interfaces (pilot and crew controls), shall be compatible with Class A, Type I, NVD technology in accordance with MIL-STD-3009.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of State, Regional Procurement Support Office (RPSO) Florida, seeks expressions of interest from small businesses holding GSA schedule contracts regarding a proposed Expedited Logistics Program (ELP) to supply items commonly used to respond to disasters that may occur at American Embassies and Consulates overseas, including both natural and man-made events.  RPSO is considering awarding one or more blanket purchase agreements to contractors that can respond on an urgent basis with a wide range of commercial items that will enable U.S. Embassies and Consulates in the Western Hemisphere Affairs (WHA) region, specifically Latin America and the Caribbean to respond to disasters.  Examples of such events include hurricanes, floods, mudslides, earthquakes, terrorist attacks, riots, etc.  

The Department needs to have the ability to order, ship, and deliver essential supplies and equipment on an expedited basis to WHA posts to respond to these types of emergencies when normal ordering procedures are not available at the Embassy or Consulate.  The Department anticipates awarding one or more blanket purchase agreements later in fiscal year 2005.  No minimum order amount will be guaranteed, but the intent will be to have one or more BPAs in place to respond to an emergency.  Purchases could not be guaranteed, but having an agreement in place in advance of hurricane season, for example, would be of benefit.  

Examples of the types of supplies and equipment needed for any given response might include: cleaning and disposal equipment and materials; communications equipment; construction materials; electrical equipment, generators, and batteries; emergency food and water; medical equipment; office equipment and furniture; office supplies; emergency lighting; chain saws; water purification chemical or devices, etc.

For ease of reference, subject items from GSA Federal Supply Schedules are listed as follows:  
Schedule 51 V, Categories, 105 001; 105 002; and 613 001: Hardware, building material, tools, appliances, etc.
Schedule 51 V, Category, 639 001:  Including but not limited to refrigerators, freezers, microwaves, ranges, washers, dryers, etc.
Schedule 56, Categories, 383 1; 383 2; 383 12: Power distribution equipment, generators and batteries.
Schedule 56, Category, 412 19:  Transformers.
Schedule 56, Category, 563 19:  Lumber (treated & untreated), plywood & siding material.
Schedule 58, I Category, 219 3:  Audio & Video Equipment, telecommunications, & security solutions.
Schedule 65, II Category, A:  Medical equipment and supplies.
Schedule 65, II Category, A-59:  Medical equipment and supplies: Defibrillators.
Schedule 70, Categories, 132 8 and 132 12:  Information technology equipment, software and services.
Schedule 71 I, Category, 711 8:  Office furniture.
Schedule 71 III, Category, 71 310:  High-density storage cabinets.
Schedule 73, Category, 302 2:  Emergency water and food non-perishable subsistence meals.
Schedule 73, Categories, 375 200; 375 364; and 476 13: Cleaning equipment and supplies, chemicals and services.
Schedule 75, Category, 75 200:  Office products which include, but are not limited to xerography paper, fax paper, envelopes, pencils, markers, etc.
Schedule 78, Category, 366 12:  Safety and warning signs.
Schedule 81 I B, Category, 617 2:  Packing supplies, bags, sacks, cartons, crates, etc.

The Department has a transportation network that can arrange for quick delivery of needed items once they are delivered to our consolidated receiving point in Miami.  Air shipment would only be used in the most critical cases. 

In addition, suggestions as to how the Department might improve its responsiveness following a disaster are welcome.  An effective partnership with the private sector is essential to providing the extraordinary level of support needed for successful disaster response.

Interested contractors should send a brief (no more than 5 pages) expression of interest/capability statement listing at least the following information: 
1)	Types of items available (such as tools, equipment, emergency supplies, etc.); 
2)	GSA contract information (including point of contact at your firm for ordering); 
3)	Availability and response times (how fast you can deliver), including any expedited ordering mechanisms available (such as web site, quick ship ordering and fulfillment options, etc.);
4)	Availability of air shipment to overseas locations.

Please send information by email to Rob Lloyd, Regional Procurement Support Office Florida, at lloydre@state.gov by April 29, 2005.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) AND NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP)

The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) is seeking sources that are capable of providing a commercial product suite for a Department of Defense (DOD) enterprise-wide, distributed architecture for auditing security logs from a variety of computer architectures and operating systems. The software must be capable of identifying and evaluating events, and providing alerts to a user community based upon configurable site rules.

The system will reside on the Unclassified but Sensitive Internet Protocol Router Network (NIPRNet) and Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet), and will utilize Virtual Private Network (VPN), Local Area Network (LAN) and Wide Area Network (WAN) technologies.  The IT environments in which auditing will occur may be any or all of the following: Unclassified, Confidential, Secret and Top Secret. 

The audit server software must collect from a variety of operating systems, application software, databases and communication devices such as firewalls and routers. The audit server software must be capable of auditing itself internally.  

Transmission methods should utilize mechanisms to maintain the security and integrity of the data. This includes but is not limited to: compression, hash counts, encryption, and secure layering of transmission. For alerting purposes and to preclude tampering, the transmission must be timely. The transmission architecture must be able to send and receive data in streaming mode and in failsafe batch-processing mode in the event of network issues.

Users must be able to scan the database locally and remotely. Users must be able to review their records, however they should be prevented from reviewing data belonging to other projects. The user view must incorporate a graphical user interface (GUI) that displays multiple levels of alerting for easier identification and notification of log events.  The GUI-interface should not reside on the same system as the audit server database. The GUI should provide users and administrators with easy access to their data and to the control clients. The GUI should provide real-time policy control and alerting capabilities.

Data should be stored on-line for a minimum of one week, to provide users ample time to review records in the database and possibly use records as a reference should an incursion occur.  Off-line storage of the binary data and audit logs for a period of at least one year is required. For legal proceedings in the event of a security breach, data may be required to be retrievable for periods longer than one year.  The audit server must have the ability to retrieve and parse stored binary files at any time for analysis.

To preclude tampering with the audit data once it has been collected, the audit server database should log all events internally within the repository server application. Events and triggers should be capable of being dynamically configured to inform of potential situations. 

The vendor will be responsible for providing version upgrades, releases and patches.

Software must have applied for and received a National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) conformance claim rating of EAL4 or have applied for and will receive their rating for the product within one calendar year. 

There is no bid package or solicitation document associated with this announcement. The requested information is for planning purposes and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as the result of the submission of contractor's information. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for proprietary information not properly identified.   Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations.

Interested firms should email their capability statement addressing the above requirement to Mr. Steve Yogodzinski at Steve.Yogodzinski@disa.mil by 15 May 2005.   Firms should also provide their business size, CAGE Code, DUNS number, and GSA Schedule contract number, if applicable.

<DESC>NOTE: THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE REQUIRES A CAPABILITY RESPONSE IN A SPECIFIC FORMAT BY A SPECIFIC DUE DATE.  SEE BELOW FOR DETAILS.  THE FORMAT FOR SUBMISSION (ATTACHMENT 1, QUAD CHART) WILL BE PUBLISHED SEPARATELY.



INTRODUCTION

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA), Office of Security Technologies (CTO), is sponsoring a Technology Readiness Evaluation (TRE 05-B) for explosives detection systems for inspection of containerized and/or palletized air cargo.  The laboratory and field testing for TRE 05-B is scheduled for the 3-4QFY05 timeframe, and will examine both the effectiveness and suitability of candidate systems.  It is anticipated that additional TRE announcements will be released during the fiscal year and will be standardized, recurring venues for commercial vendors and academic and government laboratories, to have their technologies tested and evaluated in both field and laboratory environments. In addition to the previously released TRE 05-A announcement for break-bulk air cargo, future TREs will focus on additional air cargo screening requirements in the area of mail cargo.

OPERATIONAL FOCUS

The focus of TRE 05-B is to evaluate technologies and systems designed to screen containerized and/or palletized air cargo for explosive threats.  Screening containerized and/or palletized air cargo will cover the use of Unit Load Devices (ULDs) for containerized and/or palletized loads loaded in passenger aircraft. Vendors are requested to provide the dimensions, volume and weight that their systems can handle in block 2 of the Quad Chart. Further information on ULDs can be found at the following website:

http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Unit-Load-Device

Air cargo includes, but is not limited to the following: printed matter, electronic equipment, machine parts, wearing apparel, medical supplies, other dry goods, fresh cut flowers, fresh seafood, fresh produce, tropical fish, human remains, and other perishable goods.  

GOAL 

TSA’s goal is to enable a wide variety of potential technologies and systems to be presented for evaluation under the TRE process, and assignments of Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) to these systems.  Both automated and non-automated detection devices will be considered for inclusion in the TRE. 

TECHNOLOGY MATURITY

Technologies and systems at various stages of the maturity may apply under this TRE; however, priority will be given to Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) systems and Non-Developmental Items (NDI) that can be readily deployed to enhance air cargo security.  

RESPONDENT BENEFITS

The TRE 05-B will offer respondents a unique opportunity to obtain effectiveness and suitability data that can be used in their developmental work, regardless of the TRL that they demonstrate.  Further, information obtained through the TRE process may result in future procurement opportunities for detection equipment.  Although the intent of TRE 05-B is to identify promising explosives detection technologies and systems, the TSA is under no obligation to select any of the participating technologies/systems for inclusion in the TRE, nor for future acquisition efforts.  

PROCESS

The process that will be used in the TRE will be a down-select process based on respondent-provided information which is summarized below: This multi-stage down-select process will be used for all respondents and technologies.
  
•	Step One – Respondent Submission of Completed Quad Chart and Review 
Submissions of interest will be requested to submit a more detailed White Paper.
•	Step Two – Government Request for White Paper to Selected Respondents
White Paper requirements will be provided directly to selected respondents and it is anticipated that there will be a short turnaround time required for submission of  the White Paper.
•	Step Three - Respondent Submission of White Paper and Review
 Respondents whose White Papers are evaluated as “acceptable” will be invited to participate in laboratory and/or field testing. 
•	Step Four – Government Invitation to Participate in the TRE 05-B
Requirements for Step 4 will be provided to those vendors invited to participate in the TRE 05-B. During Step 4 of the TRE process, invited respondents will be required to provide one device at no charge to the government for test purposes, and be required to support, operate and/or train system operators, and maintain the device during the test period.  Respondents will be required to bear all costs associated with shipping the sample to the TRE laboratory evaluation site, providing installation support, training, and removal of the sample from the TRE at the end of testing.  The TRE testing process will last for approximately two months (from setup to shutdown).  Test units will be required to be onsite NLT one week prior to test conduct.  Testing of systems that are too large and cannot be moved or shipped will be considered for testing at the vendor’s location at the convenience of the government. TRE test locations for laboratory and/or field testing events are to be determined.  All data/information collected during or in preparation of this TRE will be treated as proprietary.

<SUBJECT>A -- Preclinical Development Facility CINAPS Drug Optimization Program
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-NS-05-008
<RESPDATE>051805
<ARCHDATE>06022005
<CONTACT>Helene Braun, Contract Specialist, Phone 301 496-1813, Fax 301 402-4225, Email braunh@ninds.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is exploring the market interest and capabilities relating to the development of a contract facility with the ability to conduct preclinical animal drug studies in different models of Parkinson’s Disease. The contract facility would have 3 functions: 1) conduct efficacy and pharmacokinetic studies in a range of rodent models of Parkinson’s disease; 2) conduct some toxicology studies; 3) provide research support for the neuroprotection drug selection process (CINAPS), such as literature reviews and assembling drug dossiers. 

Background

In 2001, the NINDS established the Committee to Identify Neuroprotective Agents for Parkinson’s (CINAPS), the process whereby drugs and doses are selected for ongoing Neuroprotection Exploratory Trials in Parkinson’s disease (NET-PD). Using an evidence based-approach, CINAPS utilizes the published literature to select the most promising drugs for Parkinson’s clinical trials. This process was well received and the CINAPS results were published (Neurology 60(8):1234-40, 2003). While the CINAPS process is sound, the quality of preclinical information used for planning future NET-PD trials could be greatly enhanced by having a contract facility with the ability to conduct preclinical animal drug studies in different models of PD.

The main limitation is the quality and thoroughness of the preclinical animal testing data found in the literature. When planning trials, there is often insufficient information in the published preclinical literature. The models chosen, route of administration, dose and other features may not fully answer some of the questions needed for bringing drugs into clinical trials, or there may simply be no replication of the study results demonstrating efficacy in a particular model. For example, insufficient preclinical toxicology (chronic) data on compounds may permit short-term but not chronic use of a drug, thus limiting the types of trials that can be conducted. 
Therefore, the NINDS has identified a need to establish a contract facility that would conduct the needed preclinical animal drug studies.


Goals of the Proposed Initiative

This contract would allow the CINAPS process to augment information about potential neuroprotective compounds by performing the necessary additional experiments and would increase the likelihood of success for agents entering human trials. It can be expected that a range of lesion and transgenic models will be included. This is not a drug development program in the sense of looking for new chemical entities or developing agents with medicinal chemistry. Rather, the testing performed under this contract would be used to optimize information about compounds that are already of some established interest in PD but need independent verification or refinement before entering clinical studies. Specific goals include:



1) Replicate published findings, and utilize different doses or routes of administration to strengthen the case for using a particular agent in human trials.  

2) Obtain important pharmacological information such as brain concentrations necessary for neuroprotection, to improve the planning and dose selection for human trials.

3) Test potential agents in different PD models to help select agents for human clinical trials and narrow the field of potential agents.

4) Perform standardized assessments and characterization in different PD models (particularly newer transgenic models) and determine the predictive value of different models and phenotypes.

5) Conduct some of the toxicology studies for select agents that appear promising.

6) Provide research support for the CINAPS process.


Information Requested

Information in the following areas could aid in the design of a possible future solicitation.  We ask that interested organizations help identify critical criteria that would be germane to any such solicitation.  The information supplied in any response to this request should address, but not be limited to, the following:

•	Advantages and disadvantages of chemical lesion models versus transgenic models.
•	Most appropriate and best measures for drug screening in rodent or other models
•	Good Laboratory Practice standards for drug testing in rodent or other models
•	Overall estimation of the number of personnel required and specific expertise needed, with approximate level of effort required for each model.
•	Animal subjects concerns, or limitations, if any, on sharing of animal models or testing paradigms; and
•	Methods of evaluation of data;

In addition, we seek information as to the capabilities, experience, and expertise needed for an organization to implement the goals outlined above.

This Request for Information (RFI) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Government.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or the Government’s use of such information.

<SUBJECT>R -- Development of Avian Paramyxovirus (APV) Vaccine Vectors
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-SS-NIAID-05-01
<RESPDATE>050305
<ARCHDATE>05182005
<CONTACT>Ivan Hernandez, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-402-6954, Fax 301-480-0689, Email ihernandez@niaid.nih.gov - John Foley, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-402-2284, Fax 301-480-0689, Email jfoley@NIAID.NIH.GOV
<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Division of Intramural Research, seeks Capability Statements from qualified sources to provide the necessary services, qualified personnel, material, equipment, and facilities, not otherwise provided by the Government as needed to characterize naturally occurring avian paramyxoviruses (APV) and identify strains suitable for further development as vaccine vectors to express antigens of highly pathogenic agents for human immunization.  Specifically, this contract will support pre-clinical work to identify APV that are infectious and attenuated in non-human primates acting as surrogates of humans, that are not highly pathogenic in birds, that replicate in Vero cells, and that can be made into recombinant form and engineered to express antigens of highly pathogenic human viruses to induce satisfactory immune responses in non-human primates.
Specifically, the Contractor shall:
A. Prepare working pools of APV (in particular avian parainfluenza viruses and avian metapneumoviruses). The contractor shall obtain strains of APVs that have been selected by the Project Officer in consultation with the contractor. We anticipate a total of 12-15 serotypes or subgroups, and when possible at least two representatives of each will be acquired. The contractor will secure all necessary USDA and other approvals. It is anticipated that, for tasks A-F, the contractor will move the viruses through the pipeline in groups of 4-6 viruses, as determined by the Project Officer in consultation with the contractor.
A small working stock (40 1-ml vials of 106 PFU/ml or greater) of each virus (total of ~30 viruses) will be made in eggs (specific pathogen free SPAFAS) or avian cells (such as DF-1 cells or primary chicken embryo cells, verified to be mycoplasma free) supplied by the contractor. The virus preparations also will be tested for their ability to replicate in Vero cells as part of this initial characterization.  The final working stock will be confirmed to be mycoplasma free and, if not, will be passaged with antibiotics to achieve that state, in consultation with the Project Officer. If more than a single passage is required to prepare the working stock, at least 5 1-ml aliquots of each passage level will be preserved. To preclude cross-contamination, viruses will be manipulated separately and careful decontamination and isolation procedures will be followed during all biological cloning and virus preparation procedures. Protocols for this and all subsequent steps will be approved by the Project Officer. Approximately eight working pools will be prepared in the first contract year, and the remaining will be prepared in the second and third years.
B. Characterize each APV strain with regard to replication in vitro. The contractor will evaluate the kinetics and yield of multi-cycle viral replication in avian cell culture (supplied by the contractor. as noted above) and Vero cells (to be supplied by the Project Officer). Possible requirement for supplementation with exogenous trypsin or allantoic fluid will be evaluated. Conditions for viral titration by plaque titration or limiting dilution will be established. Approximately eight viruses will be examined in the first contract year, with the remainder examined in years 2-4.
C. Antigenic analysis. Virus-specific post-infection serum will be prepared for each virus preparation in chickens or other suitable avian host, and the viral strains will be analyzed in vitro for cross-reactivity by hemagglutination inhibition and virus neutralization assays. From these initial analyses, it is anticipated that approximately 15 viruses will be chosen for further study. Selection will be made by the Project Officer in consultation with the contractor. Approximately six viruses will be examined in the first contract year, eight in year 2, and the remainder in years 3-5.
D. Prepare biologically cloned virus suspensions. Strains (approximately 15) will be biologically cloned in cell culture by three rounds of plaque assay or limiting dilution and virus preparations will be made: these typically will consist of 200 1-ml vials of 107 PFU/ml or greater per specimen. These will be confirmed to be free of contamination by fungi, bacteria and mycoplasma. Virus samples from each cloning step will be preserved. The selection of the strains to be analyzed will be made by the Project Officer in consultation with the contractor. Four cloned preparations will be prepared during the first contract year, six during the second year, and the remainder during years 3-5.
E. Replication and pathogenicity in birds and embryonated eggs. Viruses will be evaluated for replication and pathogenicity in chickens or other suitable avian host. Animals will be inoculated intranasally, with each group held in isolator cages. Animals from each group (typically 6 per group per time point) will be sacrificed on four time points post-infection and the lungs will be harvested and virus titers assayed to determine the kinetics of pulmonary replication. Next, a group of birds for each virus will be similarly inoculated and, at or closely following the peak of pulmonary replication, animals will be sacrificed at a single time point and tissues (e.g., lung, liver, kidney, intestine, spleen, brain) will be isolated for virus titration. Additional experiment might be done in a few cases involving intracerebral inoculation in young birds followed by sacrifice and virus titration in brain tissue. Viral pathogenicity also will be evaluated in embryonated eggs by standard methods (e.g., mean embryo death time). The selection of the strains to be analyzed will be made by the Project Officer in consultation with the contractor. Two viruses will be examined in year 1, six in year 2, and the remainder in years 3-6.
F. Replication in hamsters. Hamsters will be inoculated intranasally and animals (6 per group per time point) will be harvested on three successive days and nasal turbinates and lungs will be harvested and virus titers determined. In some cases, the studies will be repeated and animals will first be immunized by infection with one or more heterologous human viruses (e.g. human parainfluenza viruses types 1, 2 and 3, and mumps and measles viruses, supplied commercially or by the Project Officer) to assess the impact of immunity to common human paramyxoviruses on replication and immunogenicity of APVs. The selection of the strains to be analyzed will be made by the Project Officer in consultation with the contractor. Two viruses will be examined in year 1, six in year 2, and the remained in years 3-5.
G. Support LID/NIAID primate studies. The contractor will support eight NIAID studies to evaluate replication, safety, immunogenicity and protective efficacy of selected APVs (or recombinant APVs expressing foreign antigen) in non-human primates. NIAID will have responsibility for purchasing, housing, inoculating, and collecting specimens of the non-human primates; the contractor will provide virus preparations and support these studies by performing quantitative serologic and virologic assays. The non-human primate studies will be performed at a separate LID/NIAID contract facility independent of this proposed contract and at no cost to the proposed contract. Two viruses will be evaluated by the end of year 2 and the remainder in years 3-6.
H. Sequence analysis. A complete consensus sequence will be determined for each cloned virus by direct sequencing of uncloned RT-PCR products derived from the biologically cloned preparations. The selection of the strains to be analyzed will by made by the Project Officer in consultation with the contractor. This will total approximately 15 strains. The selection of the strains to be analyzed will be made by the Project Officer in consultation with the contractor. Two viruses will be sequenced by the end of year 2, three in year 3, and the remainder in years 4-6.
I. Reverse genetic studies. The contractor will prepare reverse genetic systems for selected APVs and use these reverse genetic systems to recover wild type recombinant viruses. It is anticipated that four such reverse genetic systems will be developed. The selection of strains will be based on the replication in cells in culture or in eggs and on virulence and level of replication in avian and mammalian hosts. Selection of the strains will by made by the Project Officer in consultation with the contractor.  One system will be developed by the end of year 2, one in year 3, and the remainder in years 4-6.

J. Support construction and analysis of APV-based vectored vaccines. The contractor will assist NIAID in analyzing recombinant APIV/AMPV expressing selected foreign antigen genes. This will involve evaluation for replication and virulence in chickens or other suitable avian host under ABSL-2 or ABSL-3 conditions, as well as similar evaluation in hamsters. It is anticipated that this will involve eight recombinant viruses bearing heterologous inserts. The contractor will consult with the Project Officer in the selection of procedures for each phase of this work, especially those phases in which the recombinant viruses are being recovered for potential administration to humans. One study will initiate in year 1 using materials already developed by the Project Officer. The remaining studies will be done in years 2-6.

K. Studies with highly pathogenic agents. The contractor or agent thereof will have Select Agent and USDA clearance for working at ABSL-3 with highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, including H5 and H7. Beginning with H5 virus, a viral sample identified by the Project Officer will be obtained and an influenza virus preparation will be prepared suitable for evaluation in chickens and mice/hamsters. One or two additional, antigenically divergent influenza virus strains all will be selected. These viruses will be used in challenge studies to evaluate the protective efficacy of vectored antigens of avian influenza virus H5. As appropriate, other highly pathogenic agents of BSL3 containment may subsequently be chosen for analysis in conjunction with vectors expressing their antigens, with the total number of agents not to exceed three in addition to the H5 strains. These studies will be designed by the Project Officer in consultation with the contractor. 

L. Maintain records and biological materials. The contractor will maintain a system of records for all materials and sequences that are prepared. The contractor will develop and maintain a system of storage for all of the biological materials that are generated, particularly viral seed preparations and reverse genetic reagents. All viruses will be maintained at –70ºC or below. Viruses, antisera, cDNA clones, and other materials will be provided to the Laboratory of Infectious Diseases. The contractor will distribute these materials to third parties at the direction of the Project Officer.

     M. Delivery of results and materials. Sequences and assay results will be transmitted electronically within one (1) week of the date of completion of the analysis in order to accomplish the goals of this contract. Completed virus suspensions and cDNA stocks will be delivered within one (1) week of request.

 

Any potential offeror must be able to document the experience and capabilities of professional and technical personnel that would be assigned to this project. The professional and technical personnel shall have extensive experience in the preparation of viruses, in particular APV, and their analysis in vitro; experience in the use of experimental animals, including virus infection and harvesting of tissues for virus titration; experience in sequence analysis and cDNA preparation and cloning of viral genomes that have not previously been sequenced; and experience in recovery of paramyxoviruses or comparable viruses using reverse genetics.  The Offeror must have the established capability for laboratory work and animals testing (rodents or chickens) at ABSL-2 and ABSL-3, and must have documented experience with viral infection of animals and virus isolation from animals at ABSL-2 and ABSL-3. The Offeror also must have or be able to obtain Select Agent approval for work with highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (e.g., H5 and H7) as well as approval by the United States Department of Agriculture for work with the above-mentioned highly pathogenic avian viruses as well as with Newcastle disease virus mesogenic strains.  Capability statements must identify the nature and size of the organization and must be submitted to the Contracts Specialist listed above.

 

Both current and potential government vendors are required to register in CCR (www.ccr.gov) in order to be considered for award of a government contract. This includes Vendors required to complete a one-time registration to provide basic information relevant to procurement and financial transactions. Vendors must update or renew their registration annually to maintain an active status. Both current and potential government vendors are required to register in CCR in order to do be awarded contracts by the government. Additionally, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) now requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. ORCA gives current and potential government vendors the ability to enter and maintain representation and certification information, at their convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.

<SUBJECT>B--Intent to Sole Source
<DESC>GovWorks on behalf on the Center for Army Analysis intends on awarding a sole source contract to The Dupuy Institute (TDI) for the below listed requirement.  CAA is acquiring services as a follow on to a previous study to produce an estimate of the possible intensity and duration of a modern guerilla war.  Intensity will be measured in terms of "blue side" (intervening forces) losses.  As such, it will serve to provide a casualty estimate for such a war.  Since this estimate will also address duration of the conflict, this effort may serve as a basis for doing cost estimation.  This project will also attempt to address projected force sizes for such a war. The focus of the research is to examine casualties from various guerilla conflicts in the 20th century, including but not limited to UK in Palestine, Polisario Rebellion, Vietnam in Cambodia, Tamil Insurgency in Sri Lanka, The First Intifada, Somalia, The Second Intifada, Indonesia in Timor, Soviet Intervention in Hungary, First Chechen War, Second Chechen War, Ukrainian Independence Movement, Tanzania in Uganda, Communist China in Tibet, US Invasion of Panama, US Invasion of Grenada, Lebanon.  The award will have four tasks and a final report.  The focus of the research is to examine casualties from various guerilla conflicts in the 20th century. TASK 1, Conduct a survey of strengths, losses, and duration of a number of guerilla wars in the past. TASK 2, Collect statistical data about force strengths and losses, assembled on a monthly or more detailed basis. Determine the patterns of losses in the various wars examined, including the degree of variation in casualties from month to month. TASK 3, Determine if casualties tend to peak at certain points during the course of the operations; and present data in a historical analysis in a form useful for assessments of current or future operations. TASK 4, Assemble basic narratives of each of the guerilla wars in an attempt to identify those major events or turning points in each of the wars that resulted in a downturn or upturn in the casualty patterns.  In combination with the initial study, this project will provide additional insight to the Army leadership and to the analytical community casualty estimation in guerilla conflicts that will be of value to the Army as it transforms. TDI will provide a final report at the end of this effort. It will consist of seven major sections: Introduction and background, General Description of various guerilla conflicts, Statistical data and historical analysis of casualties in guerilla conflicts, Detailed description of casualties in guerilla conflicts, Examination of wars of liberation vice wars of conquest/regime change, and Conclusions.  TDI is a Non-Profit institution and the only known provider of scholarly research and objective analysis of historical data related to armed conflict and the resolution of armed conflict.  The use of TDI in a sole source contract is in accordance with FAR 6.302-1.  TDI has been chosen because of previous efforts that have been completed by TDI, their expertise in the field, and their availability to complete the project in the short time period necessary for the analysis project.  The anticipated award date is May 02, 2005 and the total project length is estimated at 273, days.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Any questions regarding this effort should be directed to Alan Rumney at (703) 787-1329, or by email at alan.rumney@mms.gov.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation HSCG85-05-R-625615 for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This Request for Quotations incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-19.  This is small business set-aside procurement.  The NAICS is 721110.  
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011.

6		PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE

USTDA is seeking to hire an expert to travel to Madagascar to provide advisory assistance to the Madagascar Ministry of Transport for their review of the proposals for the USTDA-funded Mahajanga Barge Lightering Project Feasibility Study.

In FY2004, USTDA provided grant funding for the Mahajanga Barge Lightering Feasibility Study in the amount of $374,250.  The grant was since competed through FedBizOpps, and the Ministry of Transport received eleven bids for the project.  The Grantee has found that it does not have enough English-speaking staff to be able to review the bids in a reasonable time-frame, and has requested USTDA assistance to provide an advisor to their review committee to assist particularly with the language barrier.  Madagascar is a francophone country with a limited English knowledge base.  

Together with the Grantees bid review committee, the selected consultant will review each of the eleven proposals received by the Ministry of Transport for the Mahajanga Barge Lightering Project Feasibility Study, funded by USTDA.  The primary responsibility of the consultant will be to provide language clarification to the review committee during their review process.  The consultant may facilitate the committees understanding of certain points of the proposals by providing technical advice to the committee upon request.  The consultant should be involved with the process until the Grantee is able to make a selection or has all of the clarifications needed to do so, whichever comes first.  

The consultant will be fluent in French and will have experience with the port sector to sufficiently provide translation and clarification for this tender.  The consultant will be expected to travel within approximately two weeks of selection to Madagascar to conduct the assistance.  It is expected that the assistance will take approximately 2.5 weeks; the consultant should expect to be in-country for this entire period of time.  The consultant will be required to provide a short report outlining his/her work and the results of this work before a final invoice can be paid by USTDA.  

7		PROPOSAL FORMAT AND CONTENT

Proposal sections and pages shall be appropriately numbered and the proposal shall include a Table of Contents.  Offerors are encouraged to submit concise and clear responses to the RFP.  Proposals shall contain all elements of information requested without exception.    

Offerors shall submit one (1) original and three (3) copies of the proposal.  Faxed proposals will be accepted.






8		AWARD CRITERIA

Individual proposals will be evaluated by USTDA.  The selection of the Contractor will be based on the following criteria: 

§	French Fluency, including technical fluency in the port/transport sector (55%)

§	Experience with the port and transportation sector (25%)

§	Experience with providing procurement advisory assistance (10%)

§	Price (10%)

Proposals which do not include all requested information may be considered non-responsive.
