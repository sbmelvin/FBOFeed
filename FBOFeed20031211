<DESC>The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), Eastern Federal Lands Highway Division (EFLHD), anticipates awarding an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity Contract (IDIQC) for the design of the Kennedy Center Plaza and associated roadways, in Washington, DC.  In the Kennedy Center Plaza Authorization Act of 2002 (Public Law No. 107.224), Congress authorized the Department of Transportation to plan, design, and construct a new plaza in front of the John F. Kennedy Center, and to improve access to the Center for both pedestrians and vehicles.  The project can generally be broken down into the following major phases: 

Potomac Freeway/ E Street Expressway – Horizontal and vertical realignment of the Potomac Freeway (I-66) between Juarez Circle and the Theodore Roosevelt Memorial Bridge, and the horizontal and vertical realignment of the E Street Expressway between 23rd Street and the Theodore Roosevelt Bridge.  The vertical profile of the Potomac Freeway and E Street Expressway must be lowered to allow for the construction of the Plaza on top, between the Kennedy Center and 23rd Street.  This work will include excavation, blasting, grading, drainage, paving, utilities, structures, traffic management, and other miscellaneous work.  This work may also include a tunnel ventilation system and tunnel lighting.

<DESC>The Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, AF Flight Test Center intends to award a Sole Source Firm-Fixed Price contract to Northrop Grumman Corp., Amherst Systems, 30 Wilson Road, Buffalo, New York 4221-7082, to perform the development, integration and test of direct injection components into the Radio Frequency Generation and Injection (RFG&I) system originally developed by Amherst Systems and Boeing.  This is a follow-on effort to the Infrastructure and Generic Test Capability (I>C) and Electronic Warfare Test Capability (EWTC) programs, which provided for the simulation of multiple radar and other radio frequency (RF) signals in a virtual environment, along with the generation of real RF signals radiated into free space. This effort requires the contractor to complete the development and integration of existing direct injection components into the RFG&I system, utilizing the existing system design and using already-acquired system components. The resultant capability will provide for injection of RF signals into multiple sensor input ports, with control of simulated signal angle of arrival. The anticipated period of performance for this effort will be 1 Oct 02 through 1 Jan 04.  Using Authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii)(A), Substantial duplication of cost to the Government, the Government has determined that a sole source procurement is required due to the high level of integration required, the lack of releasable system documentation, and the extensive duplication of effort and cost should another contractor be chosen, unless responses to this notice reveal other sources capable of satisfying this requirement at more favorable terms/prices.  See Note 22.

<DESC>This notice advises interested parties that the General Services Administration Public Buildings Service intends to procure design-build services for three special-purpose concrete/masonry structures through other than full and open competition pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation section 6.302-6 (National Security).  The estimated construction cost is between $10M and $25M.  The project is located in the area of the mid-Atlantic states.  To prepare offers and work the project, a construction firm must have an active Top Secret facility clearance.  All design and construction personnel working on two of the three structures must hold active personnel security clearances.  The nature of the buildings, the security requirements and the completion schedule are such that it is necessary to have a design-builder integrate the design and construction of all three structures as a single endeavor.  Balancing both the security considerations and competition advocacy, GSA has screened known industry capability for the construction of classified facilities.  Five construction firms have been pre-qualified, based on technical and security requirements, to submit offers in a best-value source selection competition.   Those construction firms may utilize in-house design capability for completion of the building designs, or procure those services from qualified architectural/engineering consultants.  Any firm that believes it meets the Government’s requirements for this project, and wishes to be considered, should submit a written expression of interest, together with a statement of its qualifications, to the Contracting Officer at GSA, NCR, Property Development Division (WPC), 301 7th Street, SW, Room 2002, Washington, DC  20407 within 10 calendar days following publication of this notice.  The firm’s facility CAGE Code must be included in this information.

<DESC>U. S. Agency for International Development (USAID) anticipates the award of a five year single award IQC contract.  THE SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED ON OR ABOUT FEBRUARY 02, 2004.  This contract will expand the use of proven child health and nutrition interventions.  Activities under this contract will focus on those areas of greatest unmet need for proven child health interventions in USAID-supported countries.  The contract also will be a source of technical assistance to USAID Global Health Bureau’s global technical leadership function.  

While focusing on priority areas of proven child health and nutrition interventions, the contract’s programs and activities will consist to a great extent of actions that simultaneously strengthen the health systems of countries.  Community delivery of antibiotics for ARI, for example, cannot succeed without strengthening human capacity development through health worker and volunteer training.   The strengthening of multi-level health systems as the platform to deliver proven child health interventions is the backbone of USAID’s approach to sustainable improvements in child health.

In addition to increasing the use of proven child health interventions, the contract will advance policy and global leadership for child health, providing services to the USAID Washington and missions for international and national forums and global and national advocacy activities and for formulating and implementing child health policies. Finally, the contract will identify, apply, and transfer cost effective approaches for achieving improved coverage and higher stage results for child health and nutrition interventions.  

USAID’s approach recognizes the important role and contribution of Private Voluntary Organizations in implementing key child health and nutrition strategies at the household, community and facility levels.  During the course of the contract, the offeror will be expected to collaborate with and provide technical support to PVOs in these priority areas, to provide training and access to the latest information, and to utilize the learning and experiences of PVOs in community-based approaches to expand coverage at regional and national levels. 

The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541990.

FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION applies and no numbered notes apply.


The solicitation is limited to this electronic medium only.  Requests for other copies of the solicitation will be disregarded without notice to the requestor.

<DESC>The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), Global Health (GH), anticipates the award of a single award Indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC) in hygiene improvement and a multiple award IQC for Environmental Health.

THE SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED ON OR ABOUT FEBRUARY 02, 2004.

The purpose of the Hygiene Improvement and Environmental Health contracts will be to establish world-wide mechanisms to support the Bureau of Global Health as well as other USAID Missions and Bureaus in the implementation of environmental health activities. These activities support strategic objectives in health as well as other USAID development sectors.  The two areas of award will maintain USAID access to the full range of environmental health services currently available under the Environmental Health Project IQC.  The Hygiene Improvement award will focus efforts on critical core support to the Bureau for Global Health and for field implementation of hygiene improvement activities in collaboration with USAID Missions and Bureaus.  The more flexible Environmental Health awards shall provide cost-effective access to technical expertise and implementation support to meet evolving USAID needs in environmental health.

Both the Hygiene Improvement and Environmental Health awards will work within the strategic frameworks of the USAID Missions and Bureaus.  The objective of the Hygiene Improvement award is to provide USAID with streamlined access to technical expertise and implementation support in effective hand washing; use of sanitation; and point-of-water quality improvement, with a focus on achieving large-scale implementation of the targeted interventions.  The objective of the Environmental Health awards(s) is to provide access to a broad range of expertise in interventions to reduce exposure to agents of disease and to hazards which exacerbate disease, by focusing on improvements in the physical environment and in key behaviors.  Activities under both Hygiene Improvement and Environmental Health will be possible on a broad scale, from personal to household to community to sub-national to national to regional to global, as appropriate based on the issues addressed in the individual task orders.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT.  The Naval Facility Contracts Office (NAVFACCO) intends to award on a Sole Source basis contract under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) to MAR Incorporated of Rockville, MD to provide specialized technical support for the Sensor Test Area (STA) to include planning and participating in critical magnetic and acoustic sensor testing, conducting sediment coring and analysis, maintaining and adding test items to the STA, and maintaining the Orange County Water District (OCWD) operating permit.  The Navy requires that the contractor have a Top Secret Facility Clearance.  MAR Incorporated is the only responsible source that can meet the Navy's requirement.  They installed the cables in the STA at OCWD, conducted final installation survey of the cables & have detailed knowledge critical to supporting the scheduled test in January 2004. They are qualified to conduct the sediment coring & analysis as they have the detailed knowledge of the cable location. They are the only contractor in possession of STA operating permit and therefore authorized to install equipment, operate support equipment, conduct sensor testing, maintain and improve the STA in Huckleberry Pond of the OCWD.  Requesting a change to the OCWD operating permit would take a minimum of a 4 month review and approval period.  This would cause an unacceptable delay in the previously scheduled sensor tests.  The Purchase Order is a Firm Fixed Price (FFP

THEREFORE OFFERORS INITIAL PROPOSALS SHOULD CONTAIN THE OFFERORS BEST TERM. This is an indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract with no pre-established fixed contract prices.  The actual amount of work to be performed and the time of such performance will be determined by the Contracting Officer or his/her properly authorized representative, who will issue written task orders to the contractor(s).  Award of task orders will be on a firm fixed price basis.  The work to be acquired under this solicitation is for new construction, repair, and renovation by design-build or (to a lesser extent by design-bid-build) of airfield paving and heavy duty paving for military operational vehicles at various locations within Arizona, California, Nevada, and New Mexico.  However, it is anticipated that the majority of the work will be performed in Southern California.  Types of projects may include, but is not limited to:  runways, taxiways, aircraft parking aprons, landing craft parking, and parking for other heavy operational military equipment and incidental work relating thereto. In support of design-build strategies, each offeror shall possess in-house capabilities or employ the services of a Lead Design Firm (A-E) experienced in the design development and coordination of projects within the scope of this contract.  Offerors may offer multiple design teams to satisfy a variety of project types projected to be awarded during the term of the contract(s).  The Offeror and the proposed Lead Design Firms(s) for the basic contract(s) will be evaluated as a team however, more weight will be given to the Offeror’s projects submitted for evaluation than those submitted by the Lead Design Firm.  Lead Design Firm(s) (A-E), their subsidiaries and affiliates that are involved at the RFP or design stage of a particular project will not be allowed to propose or be used on a Task Order for that project.  Award factors will vary depending on the unique requirements for each task order, and may be competed on the basis of price, best value, or technically acceptable low price.  Task orders may be performance oriented requiring minimal design, may occasionally be complex construction requiring design development for design-build construction or a combination of both.  Task orders may not have traditional plans and specifications, but may include sketches, and request for catalog cuts, and other submittals.  In order to develop a mutually agreed upon Statement of Work, the salient requirements of the task order, will be scoped by the Government/Contractor Team.  The awarded task order will be a performance scoped, firm fixed price task order with a specific completion date.   Should any of the IDIQ Contractors be unable to competitively secure a task order to meet the minimum guarantee, award factors may be modified in order to ensure each participating contractor is awarded a task order.

<SOLNBR>NIMH-04-DB-0001
<RESPDATE>030204
<ARCHDATE>03172004
<CONTACT>Bruce Anderson, Contracting Officer, Phone 301-443-2234, Fax 301-443-0501, Email ba9i@nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Mental Health is soliciting proposals from qualified businesses/organizations to establish, maintain/operate, and replenish the Small Molecule Repository.  The Small Molecule Repository will be a component of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Roadmap Molecular Libraries initiative for the creation of an NIH small molecule library and screening centers (for additional information on the NIH Roadmap, see http://nihroadmap.nih.gov/).  The Small Molecule Repository will offer public sector biomedical researchers access to small organic molecules that can be used as chemical probes to study cellular pathways in greater depth and will provide new ways to explore the functions of major components of the cell in health and disease.  In order to provide these benefits, the library of small molecules must contain a sufficient number of diverse compounds to be screened for a large number of possible new activities and applications. To build such a library, a contract will be established to acquire, maintain, and distribute a collection of approximately 1,000,000 chemically diverse small molecules of both known and unknown activities. An NIH Molecular Libraries Coordinating Committee and an external scientific advisory group will help identify candidate compounds to be acquired from government, academic, industry and commercial sources. Over time, this collection will be expanded and modified to include compounds that are capable of interacting with an increasing number and diversity of biomolecular target domains. The development of such libraries will provide probes for studying molecular events, pathways, and networks in biologic systems that span the scale from single cells to whole organisms.

Requirements for the Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository include the following tasks:

1) Compound Identification and Library Development.  The contractor, in coordination with the NIH Molecular Libraries Coordinating Committee and an external scientific advisory group, shall identify candidate compounds from government, academic, industry and commercial sources, and acquire a collection of approximately 1,000,000 compounds meeting criteria to be specified by the Government Project Officer (GPO)/Coordinating Committee (i.e., stability, solubility, availability of sufficient quantities, ease of re-supply or re-synthesis, diversity). 

2) Handling, Plating and Distribution.  All compounds shall be bar-coded and arrayed in sets suitable for supplying to high-throughput screening (HTS) facilities.  The contractor shall have the capability to array compounds into both 96 and 384 well plates to produce arrays in formats suitable for long term storage and distribution.  The contractor shall also have the ability to produce arrays in other formats suitable for distribution (i.e. daughter-plates developed from plate replication or reformatting into higher density 1536 or 3456 well plates).  Compound arrays shall be distributed to the Molecular Library Screening Centers and other interested HTS facilities.  The contractor shall also provide arrays of compounds to investigators on a fee for service basis.

3) Storage.  The contractor shall provide dry storage of compounds as well as storage of compounds in solution.  Compounds shall be stored under conditions that ensure optimal stability and purity. The contractor shall provide the necessary expertise, equipment, and facilities to store, maintain, and track the compound collection inventory.  The contractor shall monitor the stability of compounds in the library (e.g., analysis by LC/MS, HPLC, and/or NMR).

4) Re-supply and Re-synthesis.

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) Glenn Research Center (GRC) is investigating the development and suitability of a software-based open-architecture for space-based reconfigurable transceivers (RT) and software defined radios (SDR) to enable advanced operations and reduce mission costs. Software defined radios are becoming more common due to the capability of reconfigurable digital signal processing technologies such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA), and digital processors,  placing radio functions in firmware and software that were traditionally performed with analog hardware components.	Features of this communications architecture of interest include non-proprietary open standards, and application programming interfaces to enable software reuse and portability, independent hardware and software development, and hardware and software functional separation. The Joint Tactical Radio System’s (JTRS) Software Communication Architecture (SCA) is an example of an open-architecture software defined radio system currently under development for terrestrial-based, tactical radios.  The JTRS is a Department of Defense (DoD) program to develop a family of multi-mode, multi-band programmable radios based on a common, open architecture. Currently, the program has requirements for systems operating from 2 MHz to 2 GHz with recent extensions to 55 GHz SATCOM terminals with wideband waveforms. NASA/GRC plans to issue a Request for Offer (RFO) for a study and modeling effort which will explore the technologies, cost, benefits, and risks to establish an open-architecture for reconfigurable transceivers and software defined radios for NASA, possibly leveraging or extending the JTRS SCA or its approach for use in space. A cost reimbursement contract is anticipated. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. The NAICS Code and Size Standard are 541710 and 500 employees, respectively.   All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. The anticipated release date of the RFO is on or about August 15, 2003 with an anticipated offer due date of on or about September 16, 2003. An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B". The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.

<DESC>The National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) has a need to dry lease up to 20 airplanes for ten (10) years, to be used on wildland fire missions for lead plane and other administrative activities.  The aircraft will be flown in mountainous terrain below 500 feet in turbulent conditions.  The aircraft shall be made available for the year-around exclusive use by the Government and flown by U.S Forest Service Pilots.  The Government shall provide fuel and pilots, and the contractor(s) shall provide all maintenance to the aircraft throughout the life of the contracts.  Government-owned facilities are not available for contractors use.  The Government anticipates awarding two contracts for ten (10) aircraft each, which may be of different types and models, on a fixed-price monthly lease and flight hour basis.  Delivery of the aircraft is anticipated to be over a two-year period (2004 through 2005).  The Government intends to use Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 15 procedures, with full and open competition, and award performance-based contracts on a best-value basis.  The aircraft will be evaluated on its ability to perform low level leadplane and air attack missions, and its ability to perform administrative activities.  This will be accomplished by offerors making available fully equipped aircraft (one of each type/model offered) for test flights to be scheduled during the evaluation process prior to contract awards.  We anticipate posting the solicitation on this website within 30-60 days from the posting of this notice.

<DESC>DATES:  White papers will be accepted on a continuous basis until 2pm Eastern time on 30 Dec 2008.  FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.  See Section IV of this announcement for further details. I.  FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:  AFRL/IF has asserted its leadership role and developed and transitioned products in Information Assurance R&D for a number of years.  Most recently, AFRL/IF has expanded this role to address all aspects of Network Combat Operations or Cyber Operations.  This BAA is a contracting tool directly responsive to an AFRL/IF Strategic Plan in the technical area of Cyber Operations. The technologies being pursued will provide greater functions and capabilities within the Information Warfare domain and push not only Air Force and DoD needs, but also those of National Security, Homeland Defense and Critical Infrastructure Protection. The technologies endorsed will take into full account the Air Force's move toward transformation. The technology research in the BAA will be focused in the following areas: Covert Cyber Operations;  Threat Evaluation, Attack Recognition and Diagnosis; Assured Infostructure Support; Wireless Information Assurance; Complex Systems.  II. General Information: The Government may, at its sole discretion, require that research results be documented in a paper suitable for publication in a national and/or international peer-reviewed journal or professional journal. III. Background: The Air Force Research Laboratory Information Directorate's (AFRL/IF) has developed a responsive Information Warfare Research and Development (R&D) technology program. The objective is to meet the needs of the Air Force's Information Operations doctrine. Specifically, it is focused on Cyber Operations which includes: Information Assurance, Computer Network Defense, Cyber Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance, and Computer Network Attack.   Information Assurance (IA) comprises those measures to protect and defend information and information systems by ensuring their availability, integrity, authenticity, confidentiality, and nonrepudiation.  Computer Network Defense is actions taken to plan and direct responses to unauthorized activity in defense of Air Force information systems and computer networks. Commanders should provide CND planning guidance to the staff, as well as supporting and subordinate commanders, as part of the "commander's intent." CND actions include analyzing network activity to determine the appropriate course of action (COA) to defend Air Force networks. Computer Network Attack operations are conducted using information systems to disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information resident in computers and computer networks, or the computers and networks themselves. Cyber Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) are functions in cyberspace that result in the ability to gather information about the adversary, their intentions, and their capabilities.  IV. Objectives: The objective of this BAA is to address highly innovative R&D areas in Cyber Operations.  Proposed work should address the innovation and strategic thought of the 21st century adversary, and develop new concepts to counter with innovative information-based capabilities. Further, proposed work  should address new concepts for  continuously analyzing the information battlespace to identify US vulnerabilities and adversary weaknesses, and develop new defensive  and offensive strategies and capabilities accordingly. V. Research Areas: The following section describes several critical technical areas that are a focus under this BAA to receive attention. These areas are high leverage areas that must be worked in order to address the most difficult Air Force requirements, provide the Air Force with the greatest technology push possible, and surface opportunities for contributing to important national security issues such as defending information systems and countering cyber terrorism.  A.  Covert Cyber Operations.  The area of Covert Cyber Operations holds tremendous potential as a major future thrust for AFRL/IF. It is an area that can be described as allowing us access to the cyberspace domain for the purpose of adversary monitoring, intelligence gathering or information-based attack. In order to make the Covert Cyber Operations area a fully functional Air Force capability we must develop effects-based tools that allow us to plan for and achieve the desired effects of a planned cyber operation. For example, deploying effects-based tools that give decision makers lines of reasoning and their respective scenario implications would be valuable addition to the Cyber Operations and conventional warfare arsenal. This gives the decision maker a comprehensive "information set" that presents only useful information and disallows noise. Work is needed in the areas of Cyber ISR and Computer Network Attack (CNA). Cyber ISR entails developing technology for gathering information about the adversary, their intentions, and their capabilities and is necessary for identification and targeting of the adversary in cyberspace. CNA tools and systems that must be developed to penetrate an adversary's detection system and remain hidden until triggered. Cyber Operations interest areas include access, targeting, mission planning, attack effectiveness measures, attack damage assessment, and CNA tool development. B. Threat Evaluation, Attack Recognition and Diagnosis. The threat evaluation, attack recognition and diagnosis area is one that will be of critical importance in the future for not only the Air Force, but also DoD and U.S. critical infrastructures. As discussed above, the Air Force and DoD are building information systems and networks and offering "information services that rely on more complex and larger-scale information networks each year (and more recently, wireless and high speed). It is apparent that it is extremely difficult if not impossible to prevent all attacks against such systems. The ability to recognize attacks, evaluate the threat and diagnose the salient aspects of such attacks becomes a critical issue. New R&D is needed to address aspects of early warning. Early recognition of an adversary information warfare attack means that we must have technology in place that can look across both time and space looking for events that may seem insignificant in isolation but taken together could be laying the foundation for a large-scale attack, such as distributed denial of service. In addition to improving intrusion detection capabilities, tools need to be developed that address correlation and fusion of cyberspace attack indicators. Work also needs to continue in the area of cyberspace visualization and situation awareness to better assist the overloaded operator in attack recognition and diagnosis. Another area of critical importance is cyber forensics and attack assessment. Computer forensics is an area most commonly associated with law enforcement. The R&D proposed in this BAA addresses the gathering of digital evidence for the purpose of "just-in-time" attack assessment in a complex network environment. The need to gather digital evidence in the military information environment is critical as the commander needs accurate, verifiable evidence of who is attacking, what techniques they are using, and where the attacker is located. In addition, accurate digital evidence drives the response whether it is defensive or offensive. Finally, an area of particular importance in the area of threat evaluation, attack recognition and diagnosis concerns the insider threat. The insider threat is one of the most insidious threats facing the implementation and full realization of Network-Centric Warfare technologies. First, a lack of fine-grained security controls on the inside may mean that a malicious insider could gain access to information above their classification level or not within their need-to-know profile. Adding to this, a lack of sufficiently fine-grained auditing tools would make it difficult if not impossible to accurately determine if someone or a group of collaborators are violating the information assurance policy.  C. Assured Infostructure Support. The Air Force is an information intensive organization that relies upon a complex, interconnected collection of networks and information systems to carry out its mission. These networks and information systems must have a strong defense against the myriad of threats that we face today and will increase in capability in the future. Since greater attention is being given to resolve operational stovepipes and the need for better systems integration, multi-level security (MLS) and secure mobile code continue to be critical technical areas. Technology is also needed to integrate and reason about both network management and intrusion detection data. Related to the fault tolerance concept and drawing from that discipline is the area of intrusion tolerance. Intrusion tolerance is emerging as one of the most important R&D areas in Cyber Operations today since the systems and networks we depend upon must continue to operate through intrusions and keep operating, albeit in a degraded mode, in spite of a successful adversary information warfare attack.  D. Wireless Information Assurance.  A key piece of the large-scale information enterprise is the wireless information assurance segment. Wireless networks must exhibit the same functional and IA attributes as wired networks. They must be protected, attacks against these networks must be detected, specifics of successful attacks must be assessed and finally appropriate responses must be carried out. As we move to more and more wireless components becoming a part of the larger network and as wireless networks proliferate we need to be aware that these networks, if improperly understood and configured, could provide a "back-door" into our protected wired enterprise. Intrusion detection for wireless networks must be addressed as well as recovery of wireless services after adversary disruption/denial destruction of friendly networks. Software Defined Radio (SDR) and distributed boundary control technology is needed to allow flexibility in operations and enhanced assured operations.  E. Complex Systems. New techniques are needed to that help system engineers to state and reason about the complex relationships of all of the IA products within an organizations information enterprise. An improperly utilized tool, technique or product could invalidate the IA posture of a whole organization. Metrics are needed and an obvious place to start when developing IA metrics is to examine the properties of confidentiality, availability and integrity. A focus for future designs is Biologically Inspired Cyber Operations area. It is an area that holds promise for protection of the enterprise, detection of attacks, response to successful attacks, and even carrying out computer network attacks against an adversary. With the increase of size, interconnectivity, and number of points of access, computer networks have become vulnerable to various forms of information attacks, especially to new sophisticated ones. Biological organisms are also complex and interconnected systems that have many points of access and are vulnerable to sabotage by alien microorganisms. In fact, biological organisms have developed a very successful immune system for detecting, identifying, and destroying most alien intruders.  II.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The 30th Space Wing, Vandenberg Air Force Base, California intends to extend the Launch Operations and Support Contract (LO&SC) #F04684-98-C-0014 with MCA Engineers Inc, for a period of two months, commencing 1 Apr 04.  The actual length of extension will be determined by the projected award date of follow-on Launch Operations Support Contract (LOSC) solicitation #F04684-02-R-0024.  By extending the LO&SC, launch critical services will be uninterrupted while the new 6 year LOSC is being competed.  The current LO&SC provides management, maintenance, repair, upgrade, demolition, engineering and on-site support for the Western Range launch, operation, and test facilities, infrastructure and equipment.  Interested firms must have the ability to provide required expertise for launch critical services and the workforce to provide required services and on-site support upon award.  All hiring and training of personnel, learning of mission critical systems, and required security clearances must be accomplished without interruption of the Western Range and launch schedules.  Phase-in will not be included due to the criticality of services to be provided and the impact that would result from interruption of these services.  The incumbent contractor will not provide transition training since this would cause the government a substantial duplication of cost. Interested parties may provide necessary information, including written capabilities statement, and past performance references to Vincent W. Sanford within 5 days of this publication.

1. Overview: AF 36-2226, Combat Arms Program, chapter 2, allows weapons simulators to be used to qualify personnel with weapons. Weapons simulators are needed at all Air Combat Command (ACC) bases to provide continuing weapons qualification training when small arms ranges are closed for repair, ammunition is unavailable, or for northern tier bases when weather prohibits their use. During FY03 and FY04, 14 bases within ACC will be closing their ranges for major renovations. These renovations will last from weeks to months, according to the level of work being performed. Considering ACC Combat Arms sections annually provide weapons qualification training to over 75K people, the loss of even a few days of training time can directly effect ours Wing’s arming ability. Weapons simulators can also be used to provide unique training opportunities for specific missions. Units can use the systems to conduct judgmental training by the use of shoot-don't shoot scenarios or, by the use of authoring stations, they can create localized training scenarios to provide realistic training. AFI 36-2226 mandates simulator weapons must perform in all respects like actual weapons. To meet the need of the command and AFI 36-2226 requirements, the following requirements were developed: 

2. Weapons requirements to be included in the price of the system: 2.1. System must have 10 M16A2 rifles, 10 M9 pistols, and 10 M4 carbines with flat top universal rails.  2.2. Weapons must be capable of using owner installed optics, laser and inferred pointers as they were designed without interfering with system operations or affecting warranties. 2.3. Weapons and systems used to control weapons, must use accurate and validated ballistics for each type of weapon. Ballistic data must have been previously validated by another federal agency.  The integration of another companies validated ballistic data into the training system will satisfy the Air Force’s validation requirement’s under this section. VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:  There must be a high degree of variation in ballistic effects for different types/sizes of ammunition.  While some ammunition may have a relatively flat trajectory over typical shooting distances, others may have a pronounced arc, forcing the shooter to learn to compensate.  The most obvious example of this is the fact that a pistol does not shoot like a rifle.   A more subtle example involves the way some ammunition drifts during its flyout.  This drift causes the projectile to move left or right based on the direction of its spin.  When firing a weapon such as the 40mm MK19, this drift must be modeled, if the shooter is to be expected to ever fire the real weapon accurately.  In addition a high-fidelity simulator must teach the shooter to compensate for the effects of wind.  This windage effect is not only a matter of wind speed and direction, but also of firing distance.  In order to correctly calculate this effect, ballistics must be factored in.  Another function of ballistics is to terminate the flight of the projectile at the proper distance.  In the absence of correct ballistics, the projectile will fly to the incorrect distance or virtually forever.  Each of these computations allows for the proper adjustment to the flight path of that round, given the amount of time, distance, and wind that has elapsed since the round left the weapon.  The system uses that information, along with a highly precise laser detection system to provide characteristics matching that of real ammunition in real weapons.   Additionally, basic trajectory data is provided at one meter intervals in ballistic tables from launch to the terminal range of a given projectile’s trajectory.  Unit effects data is provided at range increments appropriate to the weapon involved.  The unit effects to a constant height are used for constant height and to a constant range.  Unit effects to a constant height are used for horizontal targets; unit effects to a constant range are used for vertical targets.  Ballistic data used in the calculations include:  ballistic air density, ballistic air temperature, ballistic range wind, ballistic vertical wind, ballistic cross wind, altitude of the meteorological datum plane, grid declination, non-standard meteorological data, thrust factors, base burn time, weight of projectile, twist of rifling, diameter of projectile, center of gravity of projectile, and axial moment of inerta.  All data is integrated into the ballistic equations per weapon type and projectile type for calculations.  Small arms training systems must use this data on a per weapon type projectile type to accurately calculate the terminal point of the projectile on all targets based on the vertical and horizontal range. SMALL ARMS TRAJECTORIES AND VALIDATION:  Data calculated are basic trajectories at one-meter range increments to the given weapon’s maximum range, plus unit effects data.  The weapons covered are the M16A2, M249, M9, M203, MK19, and M1200.  During validation the following data is measured by placing a simulated target at one meter and then moving it to the maximum range at one-meter increments and   taking measurements of the simulated strike of the projectile at each increment.  Once this is done a comparison of the same data that is in government or commercially available ballistic data is conducted to ensure that they match within an acceptable range.  In the case of one of the systems the mean is + or - .0001.  2.4. Weapons must operate and function the same as actual service weapons. System operator must have the ability, at any time during scenarios, to inject real time malfunctions/stoppages. 2.5. Air supplied to the weapons must be supplied by a light weight, easily portable, low noise, air compressor that can be locally repaired or replaced with an off-the-shelf model, if needed. 2.6. When a weapon becomes unserviceable, to minimize training interruption the immediate availability of replacement weapons (within 24 hours) from the vendor is mandatory. 2.7. At a minimum, all weapons must have a one-year warranty on parts, labor, shipping and handling. 2.8. All weapons must have a minimum life expectancy of 225,000 rounds. 2.9. At a minimum, weapons and supporting systems must maintain a minimum in-commission rate of 85%. 

3. Simulator requirements to be included in the price of the system: 3.1. Software and licenses must be assigned per system, not location or individual. Each system will be equipped with original copies of all programs used in the system in the event a system must be reloaded. 3.2. The system must be a complete turnkey operation to include all power cords, cables, and other items to make the system operational. 3.3.

<DESC>The Justice Prisoner and Alien Transportation System (JPATS) requires the short term lease of narrow bodied (single aisle) large passenger/transport jet aircraft.  This procurement is set-aside for small business.  The NAICS code is 532411 with a size standard of $6M.  The Government intends to award three contracts based on the operational sites of 1) Oklahoma City, OK; 2) Mesa, AZ; 3) Alexandria, LA.  The types of aircraft being solicited are as follows:  727-200 Advanced with JT8D-15 engines or better, 737-300, 737-400, MD82, MD83, and MD88 or equal.  All aircraft shall be U.S. registered transport category turbojets, meeting Stage III noise criteria, with a Certificate of Airworthiness.  The aircraft will generally depart and return to one of three operations sites; however, JPATS may require alternative sites for positioning/re-positioning of the aircraft.  It is estimated that each of the aircraft will be flown approximately 15 to 30 hours per week.  The contractor shall provide the aircraft, all maintenance, and insurance.  JPATS anticipates acquiring these aircraft under a firm-fixed-price contract with a one year base and two one-year options.  All options will be evaluated for award purposes.  This solicitation will utilize the procedures in FAR 12.602, Streamlined Evaluation of Offers, in performing the evaluation to select the offer(s) that is most advantageous to the Government.  Offerors will be evaluated on their (1) Maintenance, (2) Past Performance, and (3) Price.  Offerors shall clearly identify the maintenance approach to be used - Certificated 121/125 operator or FAA Certificated Repair Station.  Maintenance will be evaluated on a pass/fail basis.  No offeror failing the maintenance evaluation will be eligible for award.  Past Performance is approximately equal in significance to Price.  Solicitation MS-04-R-0005 will be available on Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) on or about Dec 30 2003 with proposals due approximately Feb 16 2004.  NOTE: Contractors proposing on this solicitation must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database to be eligible for award or payment.

<DESC>This is a modification to the original synopsis.  The original synopsis was posted on December 5, 2003.  The modification involves the inclusion of three option years.  Option period 1 (10/1/04-9/30/05).  Option period 2 (10/1/05-9/30/06).  Option period 3 (10/1/06-9/30/07).  The Fleet & Industrial Supply Center Puget Sound (FISCPS), in support of Puget Sound Naval Shipyard (PSNS), has a requirement for Polyurethane in a 55-gallon drum capacity.  PSNS is supporting Naval Surface Warfare Center’s (NSWC) efforts to transition experimental materials for full-scale evaluation to Fleet applications.  The experimental material formulation developed between NSWC and Crompton Corporation restricts this purchase.  Some material specifications are not available at this time to allow for a competitive procurement.  The Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Crompton Corporation, 199 Benson Road Middleberry CT 06762.  Therefore, this notice is published for informational purposes only.  Additional sources are not being sought at this time.  No telephone requests for the solicitation will be accepted.  Written requests may be faxed to (360) 476-8701 or emailed to joseph.lownik@navy.mil.  This is a sole source procurement.

<DESC>The following are questions raised and the government responses: QUESTION: (1)	Are there any specification requirements for “commercial chips, base course, #2 rock (grade A), cold patch?”  If so, how can we obtain this information? ANSWER:  There are no special requirements for the material. QUESTION: (2)	The solicitation mentions that the commercial chips, base course, and #2 rock (grade A) shall include delivery charges.  Is this a one-time delivery?  If not, how will the loads be ordered (10 tons, 30 tons, etc.)? ANSWER:  The order will not be one time, it will be placed by the activity and a delivery date and time will be arranged.  Normally, orders are 100 tons at a time.   QUESTION: (3)	Is the cold patch to be delivered at one time?  If not, how will the loads be ordered? ANSWER:  The cold patch will not be delivered at one time.  It will be ordered when need ed, based on the area we are in at the time.  Orders are 10 tons at a time. QUESTION:  (4)	CLIN 0005 – delivery charges for CLIN 0005 – 10 tons per delivery:  Please clarify this line item? ANSWER:  Correction to CLIN 0005.  This is for the delivery charges per ton for CLIN 0004 based on the 10 ton deliveries. QUESTION: (5)	The solicitation mentions that the contract is for one year.  Will the government be ordering all the quantities listed in the solicitation or is this an  “all that is needed not to exceed the designated amount” order? ANSWER:  The quantities are an estimate based on historical data and future need; the price is fixed, the period for the estimated quantities cover a one-year period.  The government will order as needed but not to exceed the quantities. QUESTION:   (6)	At the delivery location, will the government have equipment to move the mate rials once it is delivered?  Or, does this solicitation require the contractor to provide equipment to relocate the materials once it is dumped from the truck? ANSWER:  The government has a loader and backhoe to move the piles of material once it is delivered.  Contractor is not required to relocate materials. QUESTION: (7)	Where exactly is the delivery location, “PWC Pearl Harbor Marina?”  Is it on base?  Is there a map available?  Are there any space limitations at the delivery site? ANSWER:  The delivery site will NOW be inside Pearl Harbor near Halawa gate next to the government printing office.  Map not available at this time.  Space is not an issue. Deadline for additional questions is Friday, December 12th, 2003 at 4PM Hawaii standard time.

<SUBJECT>A -- Proposers Day Announcement - Helicopter Quieting Program
<DESC>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:  The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Advanced Technology Office (ATO) is initiating a new program focused on revolutionizing the current method of designing helicopter rotor blades thereby enabling the creation of novel rotor blade designs that can dramatically reduce the acoustic signature of a helicopter without sacrificing flight performance.  The focus of the first phase of this program is to create a physics-based design tool that can predict performance regardless of blade shape. This would enable the virtual testing of a wide variety of designs from unusual tips to movable flaps or slats or any other innovative design idea. Subsequent phases of the program are anticipated to concentrate on developing, testing, and transitioning an advanced low-noise blade design developed using the new design tools.

The primary limitation of existing computational models is their inability to accurately predict the pressure distribution on a rotor blade. One approach to delivering such a capability would be to make use of recent advances in Large Eddy Simulation (LES), LES-hybrid approaches, and Detached Eddy Simulation (DES). We note, however, that the problem of predicting the airloads on a rotor blade is a comprehensive problem. It is necessary but not sufficient to develop a CFD approach that accurately models the airflow around a blade of arbitrary design. It is expected that proposed solutions will include a method for addressing the comprehensive nature of the problem. Comprehensive models, either existing or new, may be incorporated into the overall design approach that is being proposed.

PROPOSERS DAY CONFERENCE:  A Proposers Day Conference for Phase 1 of the Helicopter Quieting Program will be held on 14 January 2004 at the Executive Conference Center, Strategic Analysis, Inc., 3601 Wilson Blvd, Arlington, VA beginning at 8:30am with an anticipated ending time of 3:00pm.  The purpose of the conference is to provide information on the program, address questions from potential proposers and provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities for teaming opportunities.  It is anticipated that a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the program will be released after the conference.  Please contact Mr. Manfai Fong by e-mail (mfong@sysplan.com) no later than 7 January 2004 if you plan to attend.  Please declare your citizenship in the e-mail.  Foreign nationals must complete and return DARPA Foreign National Visitor Request (DARPA Form 60) no later than 7 January 2004 if they wish to attend the conference. Attendance at the Proposers Day Conference is not required to propose to any BAA that may be published in the future as related to this technology area.

It is expected that teams of experts will be needed to combine advanced CFD methods with the comprehensive rotor models that constitute a design tool. During the conference, time and facilities will be available to facilitate teaming. Additionally, a portion of the conference will be reserved for presentations by prospective proposers who wish to present company overviews, discuss their technology expertise, or discuss teaming opportunities.  Presentations may contain up to five (5) slides and will be limited to five (5) minutes followed by five (5) minutes of question/answer if needed.  It is the presenter?s responsibility to ensure that all material that is presented is approved by the organization that funded the research.  Proposers interested in making presentations should contact Mr. Fong by 7 January 2004 for scheduling.  In addition, an electronic copy of the presentation slides must be provided to Mr. Fong by 7 January 2004 for prior review by DARPA.

For technical questions concerning the program, please e-mail helicopter.quieting@darpa.mil and an answer will be provided as soon as possible.  

For general questions regarding the conference, please contact Mr. Manfai Fong (mfong@sysplan.com, 703-351-8468) of the Systems Planning Corporation (SPC), or Mr. Jay Dryer (jay_dryer@sra.com, 703-647-1181) of SRA International Inc.

D. Supervisory Controls: The Senior Program Officer will supervise a staff of five CCNPSC employees.

E. Introduction and Background

Based on a management review of USAID operations in mainland Southeast Asia in May 2002, USAID decided to establish the Regional Development Mission/Asia (RDM/Asia) in Bangkok, Thailand to develop and support country programs in Burma, China, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam; to serve as a regional HIV/AIDS program center; to be a contracting hub (including for the $40 million USAID Mission in Cambodia); and to provide a base for disaster relief programs and regional initiatives such as anti-trafficking and the US-Asia Environmental Partnership (US-AEP) serving Southeast Asia.

USAID programs in the region to be supported by the RDM/A are varied.  They include economic governance; trade and investment; health and HIV/AIDS prevention, care, treatment and support; environmental management; economic growth; humanitarian assistance; democracy promotion and human rights; anti-trafficking; and disaster relief and mitigation.  To plan, manage and implement this program, in FY 2003 there will be a staff of about 21, comprising USDH, TAACS, US- and TCN- PSCs and CCNPSCs. The FY 2003 funding level for the total portfolio is approximately $72 million.


F.	 Basic Function of the Position

The Regional Program Office (RPO), a five-member unit, is responsible for strategy development, policy formulation, performance reporting, programming/budgeting of resources, project design and management, and public outreach to implement this regional development program.  RPO has primary responsibility for responding to requests from USAID/Washington, the State Department, the five U.S. Embassies in the RDM-supported countries, and USAID’s partners.  It serves as staff to the Director and prepares special briefing and itineraries for senior visitors from outside the Mission.  RPO’s work is high volume, fast paced, and highly critical for the overall reputation of the Mission.  RPO carries out a variety of analytic, reporting and program tasks and produces high quality products within a short time frame.  RPO staff members have to be flexible, able to work under pressure, personally responsible for the quality of their work and effective team members.  Significant travel is required by the US and senior CCN staff to provide oversight and management support for the programs over this wide geographic area.  Maximum use is made of virtual teams with USAID/Washington.

As of June 2003, a senior U.S. Direct Hire Supervisory Program Officer has been assigned to head the RPO.  However, in the absence of both a Mission Director and a USDH General Development Officer for an indefinite period of time, that USDH Program Officer will also serve in both these capacities until officers are assigned permanently to those positions.  Thus, he will not be able to devote more than a fraction of his time to supervision of the RPO.  


F.	Statement of Duties and Specific Responsibilities:

Working in close collaboration with the Acting Mission Director, the Senior Program Officer’s responsibilities will include:


1.	Lead the drafting, editing, and finalization of key mission-wide strategic planning and reporting documents, including the annual Congressional Budget Justification, the Annual Report, and RDM/A input into the Asia/Near East Bureau Program and Budget Submission (BPBS).  In this capacity, s/he will review technical office input and provide editorial and programmatic guidance in response.

2.	Organize a series of two-three day meetings on the principal sectors in which the RDM/A is active; i.e., economic governance, trade and investment, health, environmental management, and democracy promotion and human rights/anti-trafficking.  These meetings will assemble representatives from all the key actors in these sectors in mainland Southeast Asia, including USAID missions, U.S. Embassies, host country governments, other donors, and other partners (e.g., non-governmental organizations and private voluntary organizations).  The purpose of these meetings will be to:

•	Develop an inventory of all ongoing and proposed donor- and host-country funded activities in each sector;
•	Assess and discuss which of these planned approaches are best undertaken bilaterally and which are best undertaken regionally; and
•	Develop an initial estimate of the major results to be achieved in each sector over the next three years.

3.	Based on the results of these meetings, lead the development of a series of three-year regional USAID “action plans” for each sector.  These plans will specify:

•	Which USAID entities and partners are to undertake which activities through the regional programs managed by the RDM/A;
•	What results are to be achieved by those activities; and
•	What human and financial resources are required to achieve those results

4.	Serve as the RDM/A’s monitoring and evaluation specialist, assuming primary responsibility for all monitoring and evaluation aspects of the mission's portfolio, including customer service information and the development of performance monitoring plans for all programs managed by the RDM/A.  In this capacity, s/he will work in close collaboration with technical offices both in USAID/Washington and in the RDM/A itself.

5.	Serve as RDM/A’s public information specialist; i.e., prepare briefing materials, document success stories, draft talking points for senior USAID and/or Embassy officials, write press releases, and develop a coordinated mission public outreach program.  In this capacity, s/he will work closely with the US. Embassy Public Affairs Office.

6.	Provide oversight, training, support, and mentoring to all other members of the RPO staff.

7.	Participate in the study and analysis of the economic, social and political developments of countries for which the Mission is responsible and the impact of program proposals toward achieving objectives.

8.	Provides information on the political, social and cultural aspects of Southeast Asia countries, utilizing key host country contacts as appropriate, and advise the Acting Mission Director on country affairs as needed.


G.	Required Qualifications:


1.	Education: The qualified person must have a university degree in a relevant field such as public administration or the social sciences.  An advanced degree, including thesis or dissertation, is preferable.

2.	Prior Work Experience: A minimum of five years' experience in international development, project monitoring and reporting, professional writing, or, a combination of these, is needed.  This is a mid level position that requires an ability to function independently.  The incumbent must have demonstrated ability to manage a series of simultaneous new and ongoing activities, must be able to accomplish a wide range of assignments on short notice, and should ideally have prior successful experience in the design and evaluation of major donor-funded development programs.

3.	Interpersonal and Communication Skills: Excellent oral and written communication skills are essential.  The incumbent must also have demonstrated ability to work in a collegial and persuasive fashion that is action oriented.  Strong quantitative and analytical skills, computer literacy for document and report preparation, and the ability to communicate technical information clearly and effectively to both technical and non technical colleagues are required. It is also crucial that the incumbent possesses an excellent ability to work cohesively with other local and international organizations and contractors, and the ability to promote and preserve staff morale and performance under rapidly changing conditions.

4.	Language Skills: Fluent English language required.  The ability to communicate in Thai and/or another language native to Southeast Asia would be a plus.


H. Period of Service

Initially, the period of performance will be for a period of one year with possibilities of extension. The incumbent is expected to begin work in USAID/Thailand on or about October 1, 2003.
 

J. LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY: Native Speaker (Level 5) in both written and spoken English is required.  Demonstrated excellence in oral and written communication, including the ability to evaluate and interpret reports, effectively communicate USAID’s mission to the general public and deliver presentations before large and varied audiences is required. Given the nature of the position, effective written and oral communications are absolutely critical to perform successfully in this position.

K. SKILLS AND ABILITIES: Proven ability to work independently with minimal supervision or guidance is required. Strong interpersonal skills are required to establish and maintain excellent contacts with counterparts both inside and outside of USAID, and with contractors and grantees, in order to explain USAID project/program policies, objectives and procedures as well as relevant U.S. government legislation is required. In the same vein, must be able to transmit and interpret host country government and non-governmental sector program-related concerns to senior USAID officials and Mission management. 


L. EXERCISE OF JUDGEMENT: Excellent (balanced) judgement is required in working effectively with senior officials from both public and private sectors as well as the donor and private sector communities and within the U.S. Embassy in overseeing regional program activities and coordinating multi-sectoral  efforts in support of USAID’s development objectives, and in collecting, analyzing and reporting on progress of activities and recommending actions.  The incumbent will also be required to follow and adhere to the Agency’s Code of Ethics and Conduct. 

M. AUTHORITY TO MAKE COMMITMENTS: The incumbent will have no independent authority to commit U.S. Government (USG) or Mission (USAID/RDM/A, Thailand) funds on behalf of the U.S. Government or the Regional Missions. 

N. TIME REQUIRED TO PERFORM THE FULL RANGE OF DUTIES AFTER ENTRY INTO THE POSITION: The incumbent is expected to possess the necessary technical, administrative and management skills and abilities required to carry out the duties and responsibilities required of the position.
