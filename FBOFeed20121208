<DESC> VA is exercising the first option period of GS-23F-8068H VA268-12-F-0015. This option period extends the performance period from December 1, 2012 through December 31, 2013. A full description of VA's rationale for awarding a sole source to the incumbent contractor, AKOYA, follows:

 
 This sole source provides continuity of service and level of service while a new contract is competed and awarded. Womens Health Services has used the services of the incumbent contractor (AKOYA) to provide communication outreach materials to internal and external customers for the past three (3) years.  AKOYA has demonstrated unique and specific content area understanding of women and women veteran health care, and has demonstrated commitment to women veterans' healthcare issues. AKOYA has uniquely demonstrated experience in clinical womens' health issues.  These efforts have proved to be invaluable to improve care of women and change the culture in VA.  The current contract with AKOYA ends September 30, 2012.  Womens Health needs to continued communications support without a lapse in service.  AKOYA has experienced personnel, familiar with VA and VHA policies and procedures, points of contact and approved templates and formats.  AKOYA works well with the Womens Health and has no learning curve to develop a knowledge base and has developed a working relationship over past three (3) years.  AKOYA has performed in an exceptional manner and demonstrated expertise in understanding the clinical concepts involved.  AKOYA has the multiple types of skills and expertise without adding to their own internal staff; again no learning curve or time lag is anticipated in getting work underway.
 
 They are intricately involved in producing public service announcements, educational materials for public affairs officers in medical centers and maintaining a web based tool kit for women veteran program mangers in the field.   Ongoing web support is necessary to provide communications with and between field staff and women Veterans who are searching for information about VA services.  They are currently providing design graphics, technical editing and publishing to a womens' health sourcebook, a product that will not be complete by the end of the current contract period (Sept 30). In addition, they are working with the Secretary's office on a public campaign for breast cancer awareness month (October) and planning a week-long media to highlight VA focus and accomplishments regarding women that was just requested by OPIA last week to include health, mammography for breast cancer research, especially PTSD special college programs for women Veterans on GI bill.  The breast cancer outreach effort will impact all women veterans, employees and the public.   In this effort AKOYA is producing press releases, fact sheets, power point presentations and other outreach materials focused on the importance of breast cancer screening.  AKOYA has current IT security clearance, computer access, and privacy training, which means we wouldn't have to go through the normal process as it would take too long to get someone new.  By extending this contract period we will ensure continuity of service for our women veterans.
 
 The VA has several ongoing and upcoming initiatives in the next few months that will be greatly impacted by the loss of communications support.  T21 initiatives, Veterans Day events and an upcoming series of events with the Secretary in Dec related to VA-wide training of VA providers to care for women Veterans, all will be diminished without ongoing support leading up to those dates.  AKOYA can start immediately and provide personnel immediately to undertake the project tasks.
