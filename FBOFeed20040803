The specific aims of this project are to (1) evaluate the safety and performance of broadband backup alarm systems compared to conventional backup alarm systems on mining, construction and/or agricultural vehicles at various industrial sites;  (2) to validate the performance of this technology and (3) propose the modification of any backup alarm standards, if necessary, to allow for the use of  broadband reversing alarms on vehicles in the United States if it is shown that they are considerably safer than conventional backup systems.
The investigative approach will include the following major steps or tasks: (1) background research on backup alarms, (2) development of qualitative and quantitative field testing protocols, (3) preparation for field testing of backup alarms on selected vehicle(s), (4) conducting of the field tests, (5) evaluation of performance of the broadband alarms compared to conventional alarms, and (6) reporting results.
Nearly a quarter of all deaths involving vehicles at work (i.e., earthmoving equipment, material handling equipment, wheel loaders, buses, trucks, lift trucks, vans) occur while the vehicle is reversing.  Reversing is a problem which accounts for one insurance claim in every six relating to commercial vehicles in the United Kingdom.  A 1997 report by the University of Huddersfield found that 25% of all fatalities involving vehicles at work occur while the vehicle is reversing and over 90% of these occur off the road.  A major category of reversing accidents involves slow-moving vehicles such as lift trucks [1].  For example, approximately 100 workers die each year in lift truck accidents and 20,000 are injured in the United States.  There were 1,021 lift truck fatalities in the United States in the years 1980-1994.  Pedestrians struck by lift trucks accounted for 22% of the fatalities [2]. Conventional backup alarms used on mobile equipment in the United States are frequently disconnected because of their noise.  Due to the large number of accidents and fatalities resulting each year from reversing vehicles, it is essential that the audible warning of a vehicle reversing should be as well designed as possible to alert the listener, locate the vehicle reversing, and not be perceived as a noise nuisance.  Auditory warning signals have an advantage over visual warnings in that they usually capture people’s attention regardless of where they are looking. When auditory warnings are not detectable within environments such as noisy workplaces, accidents may happen because a warning signal is either not heard, or heard and not heeded, such as in the case where the signal is sounded frequently and does not convey danger or urgency.  In other instances, backup auditory warnings are frequently so loud and distracting that people turn them off rather than use them. 
Literature suggests that there are two problems with conventional reversing alarms: lack of directionality and intrusive noise.  The first problem is lack of directionality.  People are familiar with the beep, beep, beep sound of a vehicle reversing, but are unsure of where it is coming from.  Sounds are heard over a wide frequency range of about 20Hz to 20,000Hz, although this range diminishes with age.  Identifying the direction of a sound source or localizing it requires a large amount of neural processing.  Research has shown that the human brain is very poor at locating the direction of sounds when they have a narrow frequency bandwidth [3, 4]. Well-known examples of this are backup alarms and emergency vehicle sirens - where it is common for people to be confused as to whether an emergency vehicle is approaching from in front or behind them, or even the left or right.  The sounds of conventional backup alarms are particularly difficult to localize. Only certain types of sound are easy to localize and the crucial component, literature suggests, is that they contain a large spectrum of frequencies (broadband noise). With broadband noise, the brain has the maximum number of cues available to process.  Pure tones and simple tone combinations of conventional backup lack directionality and are therefore difficult to localize.  This research project will attempt to evaluate the purported benefits of broadband sound on directionality.  The second problem is that of noise pollution caused by the conventional backup alarms themselves.  Traditional backup alarms operate at a noise level, which can be heard far away, as much as 2 to 3 miles on a still evening.  If the site is situated near a housing estate, for example, complaints from local residents cause resentment and numerous complaints.  On construction sites, goods handling depots, supermarket loading bays, and other urban locations the constant noise of reversing alarms causes noise pollution nuisance to the neighbours and may result in legal action.  For example, directional broadband sound technology developed at Leeds University [5] in the United Kingdom claims to have overcome these two major problems with conventional backup alarms:  lack of directionality and intrusive noise.  Sound Alert Technology owns the intellectual property rights to this directional sound technology and licenses Brigade Electronics of the UK to manufacture and sell them.  Brigade have developed a wide range of broadband reversing alarms called bbs-tek for use on large earth moving equipment, industrial vehicles, trucks, vans, and forklift trucks.  Directional broadband sound backup alarm systems (broadband  reversing alarms) are not used on vehicles in United States because they do not comply with SAE J994 Standard “Alarm—Backup—Electric Laboratory Performance Testing Requirements” for back-up alarms published in August 1993.   SAE J994 defines a set of performance requirements for backup alarms, independent of machine usage.  The problem broadband sound alarms have with complying with SAE J994 is the specification of predominant frequency should be between 800 and 2,500 Hz.  It is not clear exactly what is meant by predominant frequency.  The broadband sounds could be seen to have a predominant frequency in this area - if for example in an FFT the peak of the broad range fell in this specified area.  This research will attempt to clarify this problem.  EVALUATION CRITERIA FOR RFP:  1. Understanding of the Statement of Work and soundness of approach as shown by technical proposal.  -- 20%.  2. Completeness and thoroughness of approach to achieve all elements of the Scope of Work and other RFP requirements. --  20%.  3. Commitment to meet the requirements of the Scope of Work within a realistic program schedule and level of effort. -- 20%.  4. Qualification of personnel to be assigned and man-hours to be spent on the proposed work. -- 20%.  5. Contractor’s responsibility and past performance in similar programs. -- 20%.  Award will be made to that responsible offeror, whose offer, conforming to this Request for Proposals, is most advantageous to the Government considering the criteria listed above, cost and other factors.  An offeror’s proposal may not be considered when his cost is unreasonably high or unrealistically low.  Furthermore, cost may be the deciding factor when proposals are ranked technically equal.  Since the technical criteria are considered of greater importance, the Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the low offeror.  STATEMENT OF WORK:  Task I: Background Research.  Investigate the use of broadband sound alarms for backup alarms.  The acoustical properties of the broadband backup alarms that do not comply with SAE standard J994 shall be identified such as the predominate frequency characteristic.  Clarify what Standard J994 defines as predominate frequency.  Make contact with vehicle backup alarm manufacturers and experts in industry.  Obtain and review literature on broadband, conventional, and any multi-frequency backup alarms available on the market.  Develop a spreadsheet comparing the technical characteristics of these alarms.  Task II: Develop Methods for Measuring Human Response to the Directionality of Backup Alarms in the Field.  1)  Develop a generic qualitative interview survey form for interrogating selected site personnel (see Task III) about the directionality performance of broadband alarms versus conventional alarms.  Develop a protocol for human subject testing as required by CDC, if necessary.  Through the CDC contract monitor, submit the form to CDC Human Subject Review Board for review and acceptance.  2)  Determine quantitative methods to best record workers’ and pedestrians’ response to the directionality of the alarm such as background and operational sound and frequency level monitoring, and pre-event audio/video recording.  Determine other technical information that needs to be collected, such as, data required by SAE Forward and Reverse Alarm Subcommittee to make informed decisions regarding their standards.  Task III: Prepare for Field Tests.  1)  A suitable mining, construction, or agricultural field site will be selected to compare conventional versus broadband backup alarms’ performance.  Locate potential field sites.  Contact sites to discuss NIOSH project goals and solicit possible cooperation.  To maintain the field site sponsor’s interest, it is preferred that the site has had prior incidents related to backup alarms.  To reduce travel costs, a site nearby the contractor would be preferable.  Evaluate all the candidate sites and select a site for evaluation of broadband versus conventional backup alarms.  2)  Determine the number of vehicles to be studied per scenario (see Task IV).  One type of broadband backup alarm shall be selected for testing and will be obtained for the contractor by NIOSH.  3)  Rent or purchase and install any equipment determined in Task II.  4) Advise labor and management at the selected field site of the new alarms being studied before field testing.  Contact OSHA or the State’s run OSHA program to discuss research project and where field tests will be held.  Task IV: Field Tests.  Conventional beeping alarms will be studied to compare their performance against broadband alarms at providing directional cues to the pedestrian/worker.  Three operational scenarios will be evaluated: (1) All conventional beeping alarms currently installed on selected vehicle(s); (2) A mix of conventional and broadband alarms on selected vehicle(s); and (3) All broadband alarms installed on selected vehicle(s).  The selected broadband alarm(s) will be installed in the same position and at the sound level as the standard alarm it is replacing.  A thorough field evaluation shall be performed to determine which system is best. Use qualitative and quantitative measuring techniques developed in Task II to observe and compare workers’ and pedestrians’ initial human responses to the different alarm types.  Collect other data as determined in Task II.  Task V:  Evaluate Performance.   1) Evaluate the questionnaires, sound data and other data collected in Task IV.  Compare the human response to conventional alarms with broadband backup alarms.  Write a draft project report comparing the performance of broadband alarms versus conventional alarms.  2) The contractor shall make recommendations on backup alarm usage in the United States based on their findings.  For example, based on positive results of the field tests and evaluation of broadband backup alarms, the backup alarm standard SAE J994 “may” be recommended to be modified to include the acoustic properties of the broadband reversing alarms.  Any suggested changes should avoid being written around a particular patented product, but rather the technology.  Suggested changes to the standard shall be developed by working closely with universities, equipment manufacturers, and SAE’s “Back-Up and Forward Warning Alarm” Subcommittee.  Present project findings to SAE J994 Committee.  Write a final report for external publication.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items or services IAW with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ) No. F61038. The solicitation clauses and provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 97-27. The NAICS Code is 541990. The FDA intends to issue a purchase order on a sole source basis to Thomas J. Billy, 4802 Chevy Chase Boulevard, Chevy Chase, Maryland. The contractor shall have expertise in evaluating and managing food safety issues. The expertise must include a detailed knowledge of seafood hazards and controls and the issue of methylmercury in particular; food safety risk assessment and analysis; and food safety risk management and communication strategies from both a national and international perspective.  

The contractor will need to perform the Scope of Work, which is to include:

Project Title:   Request Expert Services for Risk/Benefit Evaluation of Seafood Relating to Methylmercury

Objective:
To perform risk/benefit evaluation(s) of commercial seafood that focus on the risk of methylmercury as weighed against nutritional and other health benefits, and provide options and recommendations for consideration by the Food and Drug Administration in light of the latest scientific, technical, and economic data and information.  These options and recommendations will be made for consideration by the Food and Drug Administration about actions to be taken, if any, on the basis of this analysis and discussions and input from all stakeholders, giving due consideration to FDA’s broad responsibilities under the FD&C and PHS Acts.    

Background: 
Methylmercury is a neurotoxin that can have pronounced adverse effects in humans at very high doses.  These effects have been seen in extreme poisoning events as a result of industrial spills in Japan and Iraq.  In the United States, the primary exposure to methylmercury is generally regarded to be through the consumption of fish. Almost all fish have at least trace amounts of methylmercury.   

Historically, the public health questions surrounding methylmercury have involved determining exposure through fish consumption over time that would be necessary to cause an adverse effect.  The degree of exposure is dependent on both the type and amount of fish consumed.  Public health actions, both in the United States and elsewhere, have focused on the development of “tolerable daily intake” levels for human exposure, regulatory limits, e.g., “action levels,” for the amount of methylmercury that would be allowed in fish, and consumer advisories recommending upper limits on fish consumption both in terms of amounts and types.  Fish have always been considered a good source of nutrition, but more recently, questions have been raised about potential health consequences of not consuming, or substantially limiting the consumption of, seafood.  Many of these questions derive from data about the beneficial health effects of omega-3 fatty acids in fish and other potentially positive nutritional characteristics of fish.  The recently revised consumer advisory on methylmercury emphasized the benefits of consuming fish but did not involve either a quantitative or qualitative assessment of the risks from mercury exposure versus the benefits of eating fish.    

Scope of Work:
In cooperation with the Office of Seafood, and with the assistance of the Office of Nutritional Products, Labeling, and Dietary Supplements, the Chief Medical Officer, FDA staff and others as needed, the contractor shall:  

1. Conduct a new risk evaluation that takes into account all data and all previous assessments including the recent assessment by JECFA.  
2. Conduct a benefits evaluation of seafood in the diet that includes but is not necessarily limited to:  literature search, impact assessment of the consumer advisory, analysis to the extent practicable of known and potential nutritional and other health benefits from seafood consumption and estimates of lost benefits and/or public health harm from dietary changes in seafood consumption, if any.    
3. Provide options and recommendations to FDA for changes, if any, on the basis of the above evaluation(s).  Among other things, these options and recommendations may relate to the consumer advisory, the action level, and consumer education.
4. Conduct meetings with “stakeholders” within the Administration, other Federal agencies, consumer advocacy organizations, industry, academia/scientific community, etc. on the purposes and scope of the work, the work itself, and gain their views and understanding.
5. Conduct at least two public meetings, announced in the Federal Register, and conducted to share new data and information and to obtain oral and/or written input. 
6. Meet with agency, HHS, and Administration representatives on a regular basis to discuss the status of the project.
7. Prepare briefing materials and provide support to the agency as needed.    

Deliverables: The contractor shall submit the following reports/deliverables:
1. Risk Evaluation Update Document
2. Benefits Evaluation Document (The Risk Evaluation & Benefits Evaluation may be separate documents or combined, at the discretion of the contractor).
3. Option/Recommendations
4. Meetings with Stakeholders
5. Public Meetings

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will provide adequate scientific technical support for research, risk and benefit assessment modeling, drafting, etc.; results of consumer impact studies; adequate office space, appropriately provisioned, e.g., desk, telephone, computer, in College Park for the duration of the contract.

The FDA intends to make an award immediately following this notice. The anticipated period of performance will be approximately August 16, 2004 through August 15, 2005.

The following FAR clauses shall apply to the solicitation: 52.212 Instructions of Offerors-Commercial; 52.214-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items; and 52.232-33 Electronic Funds Transfers. All responsible sources that can provide and meet the above requirements shall submit written quotations by the due date referenced above. All questions should be submitted in writing via email to sharon.savage@fda.hhs.gov or fax to (301) 827-7039. FAR provisions can be found at the following website: http://www.arnet.gov.

<DESC>The Library of Congress as requirement for preservation/achival services to re-house pre 1900 American Maps into alkaline buffered folders for the Georgrapy & Map Divisin of the Library of Congress.  Many of the Library's holding are housed in poor quality acidic folders, boxes and sleeves.

These acidic enclosures shall be replaced with acid-free enclosures that will be provided by the Library.  Requirements include retrieval of maps from flat files, removal of maps, from acidic folders, and return of mpas to flat files.  It is anticipated that approx. 30,000 maps will be re-housed. All work will be performed onsite.  Personnel requirements include professional archivists with a degree from an accredited Master of Science program in Library and Information Science, or Archives Management, or related equivalent; proven experience inarchives, demonstrated familiarity with archival best practices, and holding  maintenance/preservation activities/Services.  Solicitation LC04-C-2114 will be posted on or about June 25, 2004.  Contact Arneen Dozier, 202-707-0406 or eamil at adoz@loc.gov

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) plans to issue an order under Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA), N00019-04-G-0011, on a sole source basis with Pioneer UAV Inc. (PUI), 224 Schilling Circle, Suite 225, Hunt Valley, MD 21031 to acquire essential ongoing engineering and logistic support services necessary to maintain the Pioneer Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Program.  
 
PUI is the sole designer, developer and manufacturer of the Pioneer UAV and is the only firm with the unique knowledge, experience, technical expertise, and technical data required to perform these efforts.  Award to any one other than PUI would result in significant costs to assimilate the required learning for these tasks, a break of continuity, and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Navy's requirements.  The estimated period of performance is October 2004 to September 2005.   THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. Responses to this notice can be sent via email directly to Michael.Mcloughlin@navy.mil.

<P>(*) All missing attachments will be posted to the NARA ERA Acquisition web 
site prior to final release of the RFP. </P>
<P>The ERA system will authentically preserve and provide access to any kind of 
electronic record, free from dependency on any specific hardware or software, 
enabling NARA to carry out its mission into the future. To do this, ideally the 
system would be able to take any type of record, from any entity in the Federal 
Government, created using any type of application, on any computing platform, 
and provide discovery and delivery to anyone with an interest and legal right of 
access, now and for the life of the republic. Detailed background information on 
the ERA program is available at the ERA web site, <A 
href="http://www.archives.gov/electronic_records_archives">http://www.archives.gov/electronic_records_archives</A>.</P>
<P>Based on industry comments, the ERA business and contracting approach has 
been revised to a full-and-open hybrid Firm Fixed Price (FFP)/Cost Plus Award 
Fee (CPAF) competition. The solicitation will be for an initial one (1) year FFP 
base contract period and six (6) CPAF option periods. NARA’s acquisition 
approach is to initially award one or more contracts using a best value 
competition. During the initial System Analysis and Design phase (base contract 
period) the selected contractors each will produce a detailed System 
Requirements Specification and System Design Document. In the event that 
multiple contracts are awarded there will be a down select to a single 
contractor at the end of the base contract period. The selected contractor will 
perform development and deployment of the ERA on an incremental basis. The 
initial option period (increment 1) will be for two (2) years, and the remaining 
option periods (increments 2-5 and a final year of operations and support) will 
be for one (1) year each. </P>
<P>The Government may exercise optional CPAF CLINS for Operations and Support 
(O&S) of the system. The sixth one-year option period will be only for 
O&S of the system as delivered at the end of the fifth increment. This 
represents a change in previously published acquisition strategy in that the 
Government now plans to acquire O&S as part of this ERA acquisition 
contract.</P>
<P>The Draft ERA RFP will only be available by downloading from the ERA 
Acquisition web site at </P>

</P>
<P>Your meaningful comments on this Draft Request for Proposal will be 
appreciated. You are encouraged to serially submit questions or comments as they 
become available. Each comment addressing a specific item in the Draft RFP 
should reference the section and paragraph number. Any comments not addressing a 
specific item in the draft should be marked as General. In order for responses 
to receive full consideration, they should be received by September 17, 2003 at 
5 PM EST. Responses must be submitted electronically to the following email 
address: <A href="mailto:ERA.Acquisition@nara.gov">ERA.Acquisition@nara.gov</A> 
. Responses must be in Microsoft Word format. Please include company name, point 
of contact, mailing address, phone number, and email address.<BR><BR><B>DO NOT 
RESPOND TO THE FEDBIZOPS POINT OF CONTACT.</P></B>
<P>NARA intends to answer as many questions and comments as are deemed 
appropriate. The Government will consider all questions and comments received 
from potential Offerors in preparation of the final RFP. Any changes made will 
be at the sole discretion of the ERA Program Office. </P>
<P>This Draft RFP shall not be construed as an obligation on the part of the 
Government to acquire any products or services, and it does not restrict the 
Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach. Proposals are not requested 
at this time and will not be considered. Any information provided to the 
Government is strictly voluntary and at no cost to the Government. The 
Government will not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with 
submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred by 
interested parties for responses to this Draft RFP. No entitlement to payment of 
direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of 
submission of responses to this Draft RFP and the Government’s use of such 
information. </P>
<P>A final solicitation will be published prior to the end of the 1st quarter FY 
04 with an award being made prior to the end of the 3rd Quarter FY 04.</P>
<P>Please check the NARA ERA Acquisition Web Site Daily for new or updated 
information.</P>
<P>Thank you for your continued interest in the ERA program.</P></BODY></HTML>

<DESC>NASA/Headquarters intends to award a sole-source, firm-fixed-price contract to the University of Maryland, College Park, MD pursuant to 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source, for a period of performance of 1-year.  NASA/HQ has a requirement for improved modeling tools and techniques for Probablistic Risk Assessment(PRA).  The focus of this acquisition is in the following areas:  Human Reliability Analysis (HRA) and Analysis of Phenomenlogical Failures.  Currently NASA probablistic risk studies rely on conventional HRA methods or simple variants essentially extracted from those developed for nuclear power plant PRAs.  As part of a long-term objective to develop a practical and defensible HRA methodology suitable for space systems and missions, NASA plans to investigate the applicability of the existing HRA methods for space applications.  The contractor shall develop a comparison matrix that identifies strengths and deficiencies of currently available HRA methods.  As a minimum this review shall include Human Cognitive Reliability (HCR), and Technique for Human Error Rate Prediction (THERP), among the first generation of the HRA methods, and Cognitive Reliability Error Analysis Method (CREAM), A Technique for Human Event Analysis (ATHEANA), and Information Decision Action in Crew context (IDAC) among the advanced HRA methods. The University of Maryland possesses and has demonstrated a comprehensive knowledge of QRAS 1.6 methodology insofar as how the code is designed, coded and tested. See note 22.   Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for: 4 Standard 18650 lithium ion cell,  4 18650 cell with self-extinguishing electrolyte, 4 18650 cell with zero volt technology, 4 18650 cell with self-extinguishing electrolyte and zero volt technology. Test report on safety demonstration testing per the Statement of Work (SOW).  NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from Quallion, Inc., Sylmar, CA based on the following circumstances.  1.  Lithium-ion batteries and cells are composed of unique cathode and anode materials.  Cells from different manufacturers cannot have the same signature charge/discharge cycles or abuse characteristics.  The cell components made by different manufacturers vary as the nature of the transition metal oxide used for the cathode can be LiCo2, LiNiO2, LiMn2O4, LiNiCoO2, LiNiCoAlO2,etc.or any combination of transition metal oxides.  The anode can be graphite or hard carbon or mesophase microcarbon beads and even with this it could be natural or synthetic graphite for example, or mesophase microcarbon beads that have different bead size and treated differently during the manufacturing process.  The third element is the electrolyte which can contain a wide variety of organic carbonates, additives and salts.  Hence the cathode, anode and electrolyte are different from manufacturer to manufacturer and they have a unique performance.  2.  Apart from this, the method of processing the materials during the assembly process also varies from manufacturer to manufacturer.	Quallion uses very high purity components and hence purify their components several times before they use them to make their electrodes.   3.  Lithium-ion batteries are still progressing in terms of performance and some manufacturers are working towards making their extremely energetic cell safer.	Hence, there is constant change and increase in capacity and although the size of the can remains the same, the capacity of the batteries has increased from 1 Ah to 2.4 Ah in the past eight years.  The Quallion cells are 1 Ah cells to this day because they are made for high rate custom applications and not for normal commercial use. These are some of the main reasons for buying cells from the same manufacturer as one needs a baseline performance and abuse test data for comparison purposes. The objective of this procurement is to demonstrate safety features of Quallion’s self extinguishing electrolyte and zero volt capability relative to cycle life, calendar life and safety testing.  The advance technologies to be tested are 1) the ability to retain useful capacity after storage in a low voltage discharge condition (Quallion’s patented zero volt technology) and 2) an electrolyte additive to improve safety test results without degrading the electrical performance (Quallion’s patented self extinguishing (SE) electrolyte additive). The scope of the work includes the fabrication of 48 lithium ion cells of the standard 18650 size (&gt;1.5Ah) and perform capacity verification, storage retention, and safety tests (overcharge and short circuit tests) to validate any improvement that these advanced features provide in comparison to the performance and safety tolerance of standard 18650 lithium ion cells without current limiters and overcharge cut-out devices built into the cell. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 1:00 p.m. local time on August 18, 2004.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for the performance of a Lead-Free Solder Survey Body of Knowledge Study.  Tasks associated with requirements directly related to Lead-Free Solder Body of Knowledge study are currently being performed by the Joint Group on Pollution Preventions (JG-PP) Lead-Free Test Program.  The JG-PP Lead-Free Test Program is a collaborative test program to determine the reliability of various lead-free solder alloys when exposed to space flight environments.  This task will take existing information and provide data to support risk mitigation planning and policy development for future introduction of lead-free alloys into electronic space flight hardware.  It is vital that if the transition to lead-free solder alloys is required, changes do not impact the safety and reliability of the hardware. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase these services from International Trade Bridge (ITB).  This recommendation is made pursuant to FAR 13.106-1(b), for the acquisition of supplies or services determined to be available from only one source.  ITB is uniquely qualified due to their current leadership of the JG-PP Lead-Free Test Program. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26.

The North American Industrial Classification System code is 541330, which has a size standard of $4.0 million in average annual receipts. Following an initial evaluation of the qualification and performance data submitted, three or more firms that are considered to be the most highly qualified to provide the type of services required, will be chosen for negotiation. Each contract will operate with individually negotiated task orders issued in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract.  Task orders may be issued under the resulting contracts as Firm Fixed or Time and Materials. Task orders may be issued for engineering design services only, design and construction, or design, construction and construction inspection services.

Technical Assistance to State Planning Grants Program Grantees

The Health Resources & Services Administration (HRSA) and Special Programs Bureau (SPB) intend to negotiate, on a sole source basis to modify Contract No.: 250-01-0057, with AcademyHealth of Washington, DC.

The purpose of this modification is to allow the current contractor to assist the 8 anticipated new FY 2004 State Planning Grants Program (SPG) grantees, assist the 8 anticipated Pilot Planning Limited Competition FY 2004 SPG grantees, provide summary information on FY 2004 grantee activities, and provide assistance to and participate as moderators/speakers at HRSA State Planning Grant Program quarterly grantee meetings.  

The AcademyHealth has gained considerable expertise and experience in performing the additional work included in this contract modification for the first four rounds of the State Planning Grants (SPG) Program grantees.  Thus, the AcademyHealth is intimately familiar with the strategic planning requirements for the successful study of the characteristics of the uninsured.  The AcademyHealth has developed cooperative working relationships with the State grantees, which will be conducting such planning activities.  

Therefore, because any other organization would have to duplicate the development of protocols for identifying the levels of varying needs of these grantees, AcademyHealth is the only responsible source capable of providing these services without substantial duplication of cost, which would not be expected to be recovered through competition and under the authority found in 41 USC 253(i), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(a) (2). 
This is not a solicitation, but a notification of our intent to contract.  A justification for other than full and open competition (JOFOC) is on file. 

Cite solicitation #04-N234-5029 HA when corresponding.  

WE WILL RESPOND TO WRITTEN CORRESPONDENCE ONLY.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), Surveillance Research Program (SRP) plans to procure on a sole source basis the completion/production of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute Monograph, "The Impact of Adjuvant Therapy and Mammography on Breast Cancer Mortality: 1975-2000", with Oxford University Press, 2001 Evans Road, Cary, NC 27513.  The acquisition is being conducted based on FAR 13.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 511120 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  The objective of this acquisition is to produce a monograph which describes work performed as part of the Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET) to answer the question, "What is the Impact of Adjuvant Therapy and Mammography on US Breast Cancer Mortality: 1975-2000.  CISNET is a consortium of NCI sponsored investigators whose focus is modeling the impact of cancer control inventerventions on population trends in incidence and mortality.  US breast cancer mortality was rising slightly until 1990, but has since declined over 15% through 1998.  In order to plan new cancer control strategies it is essential to understand the population impact of interventions that began in the 1970's and 80's.  Multi-agent chemotherapy regimens were first introduced in the mid and late 1970's; while initially used in later stage disease, as its safety and efficacy were further established it has increasingly been used in earlier stages.  The use of multi-agent chemotherpy has remained limited in older patients.  It has been established that the combined use of Tamoxifen and multi-agent chemotherapy are more effective than earlier modalities used individually, and the use of the combined therapies began in the late 1980's.  The purpose of the modeling effort is to partition observed mortality trends into components associated with the increased use of adjuvant therapy, mammography, and background changes in underlying risk.  While modelers share a common set of inputs, the basic model structures and parameter estimates are unique to each investigator.  Final results (i.e. a partitioning of breast cancer mortality trends) are compared across models.  To help understand the differences and similarities across models a set of intermediate outcomes have been developed including operating characteristics of mammography, changes in stage distribution over time efficacy of treatment, incidence changes over time, etc.  Oxford University Press is currently the exclusive publisher for the JNCI Cancer Spectrum which encompasses the journals affiliated with the National Cancer Institute (ie., The Journal of the National Cancer Institute and the Journal of the National Cancer Institute Monographs).  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements herein.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:30 PM EDT (local Washington, DC time) on August 18, 2004.  If you have any questions please contact Cynthia Brown, Purchasing Agent on 301-402-4509.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Refer to RFQ-NCI-40118-NQ.

<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) intends to negotiate a sole source purchase order with Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) for renewal of membership services.  The membership provides the NRC with full participation in all North American Technical Center (NATC) and Information System on Occupational Exposure (ISOE) activities, technical reports, and software only available to member regulatory agencies in accordance with ISOE/NEA terms and conditions.  The NRC receives occupational exposure data from NRC licensees based on the reporting requirement of 10 CFR 20.2206.  These data are maintained in the Radiation Exposure Information and Reporting System (REIRS).  REIRS does not include international occupational exposure data or techniques and experiences by licensees and other regulators on occupational exposure reduction.  The NRC uses this information to 1) compare and contrast U.S. and foreign nuclear power plant initiatives, 2) identify and adopt best-practices during common maintenance and operation procedures, 3) provide exposure trends by country, by reactor type, or by other criteria such as sister-unit grouping, 4) perform cost-benefit analysis, and 5) optimize ALARA objectives.  Since the NRC and other foreign regulators use the techniques and experiences in occupational exposure reduction there is a need to establish a system for the collection and maintenance of such information.  NEA is uniquely capable of providing this information.  The base period of performance is one year with (1) one option year.  The proposed contract action is for membership services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR Part 13.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, all capability statements received by September 16, 2004 will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.   Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 813920.

·	Market Study
·	Rehabilitation of Coalmines

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the TOR, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.

Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.

Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.

The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: Mr. Janusz Olszewski, Director, ZMA “METALKO” Sp. z.o.o., Ul. Wojska Polskiego 65, 85-825 Bydgoszcz, Poland, Phone: + 48 (52) 374-76-32, Fax: + 48 (52) 361-05-38
The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for a waste recycling and gasification project in Bydgoszcz, Poland.

METALKO Sp. z.o.o., which is a subsidiary of Polish chemical concern ZACHEM SA and serves as EPC contractor on ZACHEM’s plant construction projects, will be a significant equity partner in a proposed waste recycling and gasification project.  This project provides the opportunity to help solve the City of Bydgoszcz’s waste management needs and provide ZACHEM with less expensive feedstock through a more environmentally friendly technology by gasifying municipal solid waste and sludge to create feedstock for ZACHEM. 

The gasification process recovers a synthesis gas, utilizable glass-like minerals, metals rich in iron and sulfur from municipal solid waste, commercial waste, industrial waste and hazardous waste in a continuous recycling process by means of high temperature gasification of the organic waste constituents and direct fusion of the inorganic components.  Synthesis gas in excess of what is needed as feedstock for ZACHEM will be utilized to produce electricity by a gas turbine.  Residual heat will be used to produce steam.

An initial analysis of the economics of the project show that it will result in 50% cheaper production costs of hydrogen and carbon monoxide than ZACHEM’s current costs.  On this basis alone, the project is expected to yield a high return on investment. 

The aim of the Terms of Reference (TOR) is to develop a feasibility study that can be used to obtain financing from other external sources and would include a scope of work for the engineering, procurement and construction of the project, a viable implementation structure, schedule and plan, and framework commercial agreements.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $352,600 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the TOR, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 PM, September 6, 2004 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: Mr. Frantisek Foltyn, General Director, Teplarna Otrokovice a.s., Objizdna 1777, Otrokovice 765 39, Czech Republic, Phone: +420 577 649 111, Fax: +420 577 921 600
The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for a waste heat recovery system on a heating plant owned by Teplarna Otrokovice a.s. (TOT) in Otrokovice, Czech Republic.

TOT is a private Czech heat generation company located in Otrokovice in southeastern Czech Republic.  From its combined heat and power plant, TOT sells 77% of its output to local industries, 6% is used by households, and the balance of 17% goes to service and non-housing facilities, e.g., government, medical facilities.  TOT’s largest customer is BARUM Continental (43% of heat sold), the largest tire manufacturer in the Czech Republic.  Because many of its customers require more heat capacity, TOT plans to increase its heat sales.  Currently, approximately half of the heat that is produced by TOT is not able to be sold.  Much of the reason is that its current process produces waste heat that is not recaptured for use.  

Therefore TOT is interested in installing a hybrid absorption pump to capture and increase the temperature of the water with waste heat to a point where the water can be sold.  The system would recapture much of the waste heat and allow another estimated 65 Gigawatt hours of heat to be sold annually.  This technology has been used in similar projects in the United States since the 1970’s. This would help to achieve TOT’s current plan to expand heat output while minimizing capital costs, eliminating the need for construction of new heating plant units, and producing heat in a more environmentally friendly manner 

The aim of the Terms of Reference (TOR) is to develop a feasibility study that can be used to obtain financing from other external sources and would include a scope of work for the engineering, procurement and construction of the project, a viable implementation structure, schedule and plan, and framework commercial agreements.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $175,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the TOR, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is DT4G2ADCP15MS.  The solicitation is used as a request for proposals.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through FAC 97-24.  This solicitation is small business set-aside.  The NAICS code is 541611.  The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) intends to award a sole source purchase order to Decision Strategies International (DSI) for scenario planning and training of the DLA Senior Leadership on Profiting from Conflict.  DLA is awarding the purchase order to DSI on a sole source basis because, based on market research, DSI is the only company known to DLA that performs scenario planning and training and has the proprietary knowledge of managing uncertainty through the effective scenario planning using the Strategic a planning framework, tools, and techniques that have been uniquely described in the book “Profiting From Uncertainty” authored by DSI Chairman and CEO Dr. Paul Schoemaker.  DSI is the only known company that can provide DLA leadership with this unique and innovative perspective experience.  DLA has a requirement for support in developing and articulating its vision and strategies for its strategic plan.  Period of performance will be for two (2) months.  DLA requires the support services for DLA’s Senior Leadership Conference.  The topic is “Profiting from Conflict”.  The successful offeror should be an expert on the subject and be able to provide scenario training to the senior leadership in DLA.  The following information is a description of the support required.  This request is for a written proposal.  The award date is expected to be in August and will be in the Washington DC area.  A firm fixed price contract is anticipated.  FAR 52.212-2 is applicable.  The evaluation will be based on demonstrated relevant technical capability, demonstrated relevant past performance, and price.  Technical and past performance are equal while price is less important than the other two factors when combined.  The award will be a best value to the Government.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the agency.
MODULE  I.  EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT – SCENARIO REVIEW AND REFINEMENT.
The work completed in Module I.: External Environment, will be revisited through a refinement process and is intended to provide an opportunity for DLA leadership and other constituents to be consulted for any preferences for scope or additions to the scenarios.  Senior Leaders will provide additions and refinements to the statements of trends, uncertainties and scenarios.  These updates will be used to confirm, edit and accept well-formed and relevant scenarios against which to plan DLA’s overall strategy and related initiatives.   An experienced support contractor would assist the group in its initiation and conduct of its refinement process, as well as through an interactive review process focused on the output substance and quality.  This work is intended to ensure that the produced elements are satisfactorily developed in order to act as a solid foundation to support the following scenario planning stages. 
MODULE  II. INDUSTRY & MARKET ANALYSIS  - STAKEHOLDER ANALYSIS (SEGMENTATION)
This module of work is intended to identify and evaluate those strategic segments among DLA stakeholders that will materially affect the development and selection of Key Success Factors (KSF’s), which will be pursued in a following module of work.   Segmentation and stakeholder analysis work are the key components of this module.  The objective is to come to an understanding of how and why various segments differ in their strategic value to DLA.  It involves the understanding of customers, competitors and how they relate to the Key Success Factors (KSF’s) under various scenarios.  The scope of this work will be based upon the results and findings of prior module work separately executed by DLA’s cross-agency scenario planning team (hereafter referred to as “DLA team(s)”)to analyze and finalize the scenarios.  The DLA strategy management team will conduct the day-to-day work related to this analysis, with the consultative advisory support of the contractor,.  This work can be done in parallel with the Capabilities Analysis work, which is part of Module III, Organizational Self-Analysis.  The results of both the Segments Analysis and Capabilities Analysis work will provide critical input to the KSF Analysis work for the development of effectively ranked Key Success Factors, and the visioning that will set the stage for Strategic Options analysis in September 2004.
MODULE III:  ORGANIZATIONAL SELF-ASSESSMENT – CAPABILITIES ANALYSIS
The capabilities analysis is a key component of the third module. It is a segment of work that is intended to provide an analysis of the organization’s strategic strengths and weaknesses by focusing on its core competencies.  The outcome of this analysis, along with the results of the Segmentation Analysis will materially affect the results of the detailed KSF’s Analysis to be conducted in the fourth module of work following this stage of work.    The objective of this stage is to produce a ranked model of the core competencies for the DLA.  In addition, it will provide a preliminary analysis of gaps that compare those competencies to the needs of anticipated requirements.   This work can be done in parallel with the Segmentation Analysis work that is part of the Industry and Market Analysis module of work.  The results of both the Segmentation and Capabilities analysis work will provide critical information that will affect the KSF Analysis work in the fourth module of the six-step scenario planning process.
MODULE IV: STRATEGIC VISION - KSF ANALYSIS
The objective of this stage of analysis is to develop a strategic vision, which is driven by an understanding of key success factors most critical to the success of DLA in the future.  The analysis of this fourth module of work is intended to evaluate those KSF’s that were produced as a result of the scenario planning sessions held in April 2004, along with the subsequent refinement process conducted by the DLA during the period June through August of 2004.
An understanding of which KSF’s are most critical comes from the assignment of appropriate weights and priorities to developed scenarios, segments, with which these KSF’s are associated.  When the critical KSF’s are mapped and compared to the core and critical capabilities possessed by DLA (Module III), then DLA will be in an informed position for the Strategic Options (Module V) work that is planned to be addressed in working sessions at the September 2004 DLA Senior Leadership Meeting.
MODULE V.: STRATEGIC OPTIONS
For the development of Strategic Options, the contractor will facilitate and participate in the strategic options exercise during the Senior Leaders Conference to be held in September 2004.  Strategic Options is the fifth module of the six-step process.
A detailed statement of work fully describing the requirement in detail may be requested by fax 703-767-1183 or e-mail: lisa_goins-berntsen@dla.mil.  No telephonic responses will be accepted.  FAR clauses 52.212-1, 52.212-3, 52.212-4, and 52.212-5, and DFARS clauses 252.212-7000 and 252.212-7001 are incorporated by reference in this announcement; 52.212-4, 52.212-5, and 252.212-7001 will be included in the resulting contract.  Proposals, including reps and certs (52.212-3 and 252.212-7000), shall be submitted to Lisa Goins-Berntsen, DES-AC, 8725 John J. Kingman Road, Fort Belvoir, VA 22060-6221 by 1600 EDST 5 August 2004.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Announcement: ERA Request for Proposal, NAMA-03-R-0018.  THIS IS THE PRESOLICITATION NOTICE FOR THE FINAL ELECTRONIC RECORDS ARCHIVES SYSTEM REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.
It is the intent of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) to procure the ERA system and associated services.  The ERA system will authentically preserve and provide access to any kind of electronic record, free from dependency on any specific hardware or software, enabling NARA to carry out its mission into the future. To do this, ideally the system would be able to take any type of record, from any entity in the Federal Government, created using any type of application, on any computing platform, and provide discovery and delivery to anyone with an interest and legal right of access, now and for the life of the republic. 
This solicitation will be for an initial one (1) year FFP base contract period and six (6) CPAF option periods. NARA intends to initially award one or more best value contracts using a full and open competition approach as outlined in FAR 15. During the initial System Analysis and Design phase (base contract period), each of the selected contractors will produce a detailed System Requirements Specification and System Design Document. In the event that multiple contracts are awarded there will be a down select to a single contractor at the end of the base contract period. The selected contractor will perform development and deployment of the ERA on an incremental basis. The initial option period (increment 1) will be for two (2) years, and the remaining option periods (increments 2-5 and a final year of Operations and Support (O&S)) will be for one (1) year each. 
The Government may exercise optional CPAF CLINS for O&S of the system. The sixth one-year option period will be only for O&S of the system as delivered at the end of the fifth increment.
Based on industry comments several changes have been made to the RFP.  In addition, NARA will release new documents as GFI on the ERA Acquisition web site by the time the RFP is released. The ERA RFP will be released on or about December 5th, 2003 and will only be available by downloading from the ERA Acquisition web site at:
http://www.archives.gov/electronic_records_archives/index.html
Offerors must have achieved at least SEI Software-CMM Level 3 maturity (or CMMI equivalent).
Offerors must submit proposals in accordance with RFP requirements. TELEPHONIC QUESTIONS OR REQUESTS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.  DO NOT RESPOND TO THE FEDBIZOPS POINT OF CONTACT. 
A Bidders’ Conference will be held shortly after the release of the RFP.  Only Offerors who have submitted an Intention to Bid letter in accordance with the instructions in the RFP will be invited and informed of the date, time and place of this conference.
This RFP shall not be construed as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. Any information provided to the Government is strictly voluntary and at no cost to the Government. The Government will not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred by interested parties for responses to this RFP.

<DESC>OVERHAUL SOURCE QUALIFICATION STATEMENT
SQS 04-402
Prepared 28 June 2004
SECTION A: ITEM IDENTIFICATION
Stock Number (NSN): 2835-01-330-1000, 2835-01-456-6511,2835-01-330-7765,
2835-01-456-6509,2835-01-218-8080,2835-01-456-7119,2834-01-318-0142,2835-
01-456-6510
Part Number (P/N): 386704-3/-4, 386704-3/-4, 367720-1/-2, 367730-1/-2
Noun: F-15 Left Hand and Right Hand Airframe Mounted Accessory Drive (AMAD)
Application: F-15, Secondary Power System
Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM): Honeywell Intl. Inc.
SECTION B: JUSTIFICATION FOR ESTABLISHING A QUALIFICATION
REQUIREMENT
1. Overhaul services are those repair activities and processes required to restore
unserviceable F-15 AMADs to serviceable condition. The repair functions include
complete disassembly, cleaning, inspection, repair or replacement of individual
components, testing of sub-assemblies, assembly, and final testing of the complete
AMAD, all in accordance with applicable Air Force Overhaul Technical Orders
and directives. The end objective of this process is to provide an operationally safe
and durable AMAD with an expected service life comparable to that of a brand new
AMAD.
2. The proper overhaul of the F-15 AMAD is critical to the war readiness of the F-15
aircraft. The AMAD transfers power from the Jet Fuel Starter and the Central Gear
Box to the main propulsion engines for engine start up. The AMAD also provides
mount pads for generator drives, utility hydraulic pump drives, and power control
hydraulic pump drives to meet auxiliary power requirements of the F-15 aircraft
during flight. Improper overhaul of the F-15 AMAD could result in malfunction of
mounted aircraft accessories and could disable the capability of main engine starts
and main engine emergency air starts. Maintaining these capabilities is critical to
mission readiness and the safety of the pilot.
3. Overhauling the F-15 AMAD requires expertise in all aspects of aircraft gearboxes.
This includes gears, bearings, air seals, oil seals, oil pumps, mechanical switches,
dynamic balancing, dimensional inspection., non-destructive inspection,
dimensional restoration procedures, and performance testing. The AMAD overhaul
process requires specialized equipment unique to the F-15 AMAD. This includes
specialized assembly and disassembly tools, inspection equipment, repair fixtures,
SQS 04-402
subassembly and component test equipment, and AMAD test facilities. Nonspecialized
equipment is also needed to properly disassemble, clean, inspect, repair,
restore, paint balance, and test the AMAD.
4. The probability of an unqualified source underestimating the difficulty and
complexity of overhauling the F-15 AMAD is great. This would most likely result
in low reliability of the AMAD and/or failure to meet required delivery schedules.
Low reliability will effect war operations worldwide and will result in aircraft
grounding from parts shortages. This may potentially drive high cost emergency
procurement of new AMAD assemblies or components to alleviate shortages. In
view of the risks outlined above, it is in the U.S. Air Force's best interest to prequalify
prospective contractors prior to award.
SECTION C: QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS THAT MUST BE SATISFIED
TO BECOME A QUALIFIED SOURCE
1. Pre-qualification Notice: The offerer shall notify the Small Business Office (OOALC/
BC) or, if responding to a solicitation, the contracting officer in OOALC/
LGJP, of the intent to qualify as a repair source for this item. Following
notification of the intent to qualify the design control authority (OO-ALC/LGHEP)
will review the ability of the offeror to meet all qualification requirements. It is
anticipated that the qualification process will take approximately 18 months.
2. Any firm seeking qualification for overhaul of the F-15 AMAD must provide
verification that they have a complete data package. This includes current Air
Force Technical Orders (T.O.) 2JA16-3-3, 2JA16-3-4, and all other T.O.s and
T.C.T.Os needed to support the overhaul as listed in T.O. 2JA16-3-3 and as
directed by the design control authority.
3. The U.S. Air Force requires that any firm seeking qualification for overhaul of the
F-15 AMAD show a proven track record in the overhaul of the AMAD or items
similar to the F-15 AMAD of equal or greater complexity. Specifically the
following is required:
a. If the firm seeking qualification for overhaul of the F-15 AMAD has
overhauled the F-15 AMAD previously for the U.S. Air Force, the firm shall
submit a copy of the DD250 indicating U.S. Air Force acceptance. If not
already provided on the DD250, the firm must show when the units were
delivered and the quantity delivered.
b. If the firm seeking qualification for overhaul of the F-15 AMAD has
overhauled the AMAD for a foreign military, or the Original Equipment
Manufacturer, the firm must provide documentation verifying that the firm did
indeed perform the overhaul, when the work was performed, and the quantity
of units overhauled. The firm shall provide evidence that it had primary
SQS 04-402
responsibility for all operations necessary to overhaul the AMAD and the firm
must still possess the same capability it had when this work was accomplished.
The design control authority, at their option, may visit the contractor's
facilities in order to verify that qualification requirements can still be met.
c. If the firm seeking qualification for overhaul of the F-15 AMAD has not
overhauled the AMAD previously, but has overhauled a similar item of equal
or greater complexity to the JFS it must submit the following documentation:
i. A list of applicable contracts for the past five years where overhaul of
similar or more complex equipment was performed; include:
1. The contracting agency or firm with a complete address and
telephone number.
2. The period of the contracts with starting and ending dates.
3. The types and models of equipment overhauled.
4. The contract performance in regard to completion dates/due dates,
satisfactory/unsatisfactory completion, schedules met/unmet, and
reasons for any variance in contract schedule and actual deliveries.
ii. A description of equipment overhauled in regards to complexity and
difficulty. Include justification of the similarity with the F-15 AMAD.
iii. A summary of quality and material deficiency reports, customer
complaints requiring field team visits to perform repairs, and warranty
claims received within the last two years of the production run.
4. Submit a description of the facility to be used to house the F-15 AMAD overhaul
operations. This description must include:
a. The type and condition of the buildings(s) or structure(s) housing the complete
facility; include storage facilities.
b. Provide a drawing of the proposed shop(s) layout. Show the specific areas
where each operation will be accomplished. Indicate which of the areas are
enclosed from the elements and which are environmentally controlled. As a
minimum the layout shall show the following:
i. Disassembly
ii. Cleaning
iii. Non-destructive inspection
iv. Physical and dimensional inspection
v. Scrap/hold
vi. Bearing cleaning and inspection
vii. Paint stripping
viii. Painting
SQS 04-402
ix. Machining
x. Parts Heating Ovens
xi. Plating
xii. Balancing
xiii. Welding

xv. Testing
5. Provide a list of all tools, test equipment, and test stands available in-house to
perform the F-15 AM AD overhaul. Include: a list of tools and test equipment
specific to the F-15 AMAD overhaul as outlined in the applicable Air Force T.O.s.
For any tooling or test equipment that are not available, the contractor must
satisfactorily describe how it intends to obtain suitable equipment. Please note that
some of the required special equipment substantiates great monetary investment.
6. Provide a complete list of machine shop equipment and other large equipment
available in-house to rework the F-15 AMAD components.
7. List and describe the firm's capability, equipment, and facilities to accomplish the
following overhaul processes:

12. A pre-contract award qualification article must be submitted to the design control
authority for evaluation. An unserviceable F-15 AMAD will be provided by the
SQS 04-402
U.S. Air Force out of normal field return units for overhaul. Throughout the
overhaul process, the Air Force will maintain ownership of the qualification article.
Component parts that fall out during inspection and are not repairable per T.O.
instructions will be provided by the Air Force. The overhaul of the qualification
article will be accomplished at no cost to the U.S. Air Force. Facilities must be
made available for inspection by the government; the government reserves the right
to inspect and witness any or all of the overhaul process. The Air Force evaluation
will include functional testing, possible service testing on an operational aircraft,
and possible tear down and analysis.
13. The U.S. Air Force requires that any approved overhaul source of the F-15 AMAD
be able to upgrade P/N 386706-3 to P/N 386706-4 for the LH AMAD A-D, P/N
386704-3 to P/N 386704-4 for the RH AMAD A-D, P/N 367720-1 to P/N 367720-
2 for the LH AMAD E, P/N 367730-1 to P/N 367730-2 for the RH AMAD E
following Air Force Technical Orders and directives. This requires, in addition to
normal overhaul processes, machining rework of some components and
replacement of others using a U.S. Air Force provided parts kit. A second
qualification article must be submitted for evaluation using this upgrade process.
14. Any firm that successfully completes all qualification requirements as determined
by the design control authority will be identified as an approved and qualified
source for the overhaul of the F-15 AMAD. However, successful completion of the
qualification process does not guarantee contract award. If a firm is deemed
qualified and awarded a contract, a post-contract award first-article exhibit may be
required to verify production capability.
15. Firms that are unable to successfully provide the data and documentation required
or are unsuccessful in demonstrating their ability to perform the required services
will not be considered as an overhaul source for the F-15 AMAD.

<DESC>Sources Sought and Request for Quote.  The Air Force Research Laboratory Munitions Directorate (AFRL/MN), Eglin AFB, FL, intends to award a 5-year, firm fixed price Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Requirements contract, primarily for single and multiple channel High Shock Recorders with the proven ability to survive 100'000 g's.  The contract may also allow for purchase of other related miscellaneous equipment.  Quantity is estimated at approximately 10 per year, total, but could vary.  The sole currently known source for these high shock recorders with the proven ability to survive 100'000 g's is Instrumentation and Engineering Services, Inc. (IES), 151 Mary Esther Blvd., Mary Esther, FL 32569.  Additional Sources are Sought.  Interested Contractors who can meet the requirements described herein should provide qualification packages in accordance with Note 22.  Contractors other than IES should also state their business size under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 334515 (500 employees), provide specifications for offered models, provide commercial price list/catalog or pertinent pricing data (FOB Destination to Eglin AFB), and average delivery time after receipt of an order.  Due to the high cost to the Government of utilizing unproven shock recorders in flight and sled tests, Contractors should also be prepared to provide their offered models at no cost to the Government for stringent testing by AFRL/MN prior to award of any contract.  Contractors should expect testing to last several months.  Contractors should also provide any information relating to programmability of recorders and volatility of memory in case of power loss (and what features or techniques are offered to preclude data loss in case of power loss).  The attachment provides more specific recorder requirements.  AFRL/MN also currently has an urgent requirement for 3 each IES Model 54 high shock recorders with associated Model 50-256K memory upgrade.  This is the multiple channel model for which the specific requirements are listed in the attachment, and the Government expects to issue a purchase order to IES for these items as a sole source purchase.  However, all viable offers will be considered for this acquisition.  Thus, Contractors may respond to either the Note 22 request for the IDIQ contract or the Request for Quote for the 3 urgently needed recorders, or both requirements.
Send all qualification packages/offers, NLT 12:00 p.m. CST on 17 Aug 04, to:  AFRL/MNK, Attn. Robin L. Gibson, 101 West Eglin Boulevard, Suite 337, Eglin AFB FL 32542-6810, or by email to robin.gibson@eglin.af.mil.

<SUBJECT>B -- GIS Analysis of Moose Distribution
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-43-0114-4-0048
<CONTACT>Kay Steffey, Purchasing Agent, Phone 907-747-4273, Fax 907-747-4289, Email ksteffey@fs.fed.us
<DESC>Question to be answered:  Does motorized access affect moose habitat use on the Yakutat Forelands?  If so, how much habitat is effectively lost due to altered distribution?  

What is Needed:  By the end of the fiscal year (30 September), I need a monitoring report that answers the above question with a degree of reliability suitable for education and management purposes.  Further, the report has to disclose the level of uncertainty and additional work needed to resolve any significant weaknesses in the data and related analysis. The report must be written in active tense, generally use proper nouns and follow CBE style manual conventions.  

Data Currently Available:  The Yakutat Ranger District, in cooperation with the University of Alaska and the Alaska Fish and Game is currently developing a moose sightability index.  As a part of this effort we collared 57 individual moose (36 Cows and 21 bulls) beginning in the spring of 2002.  This includes a number of animals who died or were killed during the study and whose collars were redeployed onto other moose. Both standard VHF and GPS collars are in use.  From these animals we collected 356 VHF locations and approximately 24,000 GPS locations. 

Currently there are 23 cows and 17 bulls collared in the study area.  Forest Service GIS personnel mapped the study area using ArcINFO by compiling existing cartography and aerial images.  I did a preliminary assessment using ArcMAP.  We mapped all routinely used OHV roads using a helicopter carrying a GPS unit.  These routes could be qualitatively categorized by Yakutat District personnel or qualitatively categorized using measurements such as width, area of disturbed soil and/or rut depth.  To date neither categorization has been undertaken.  

Study area:  The Study Area is 815 square miles in size.  General latitude is 59° N, elevation is between 0 and 500 msl and topography is best described as flat.  Plant communities range from beach rye to willow/alder swamp to spruce/hemlock forest.  

Additional Study Opportunities:   
(1) Security Area:  Is there a buffer width and area size beyond which disturbance along the perimeter no longer affects distribution? 

(2) Gender specific effects: Is there a difference in the way bulls and cows respond to disturbance?

(3) Vulnerability: Does proximity to motorized access routes affect likelihood of mortality?  If so how much?

<CONTACT>Sharyn Abbott, Executive Officer, Phone 202-233-2026, Fax 202-233-2051, Email sabbott@nifl.gov
<DESC>The National Institute for Literacy (NIFL) intends to award a sole-source contract to the Harvard College/National Center for the Study of Adult Learning and Literacy (NCSALL) to maintain and enhance the  Adult Reading Profiles website developed by Dr. Rosalind Davidson, research associate, and staff of the National Center for the Study of Adult Learning and Literacy (NCSALL) for the Institute's Partnership for Reading initiative.  A reading profile is a diagnostic tool that allows a teacher to assess a student's strength in each of the component skills needed to become a proficient reader.  The reading profiles presented on the website are based on the results of the Adult Reading Components Study (ARCS).  

The purpose of this acquisition is to maintain and expand this online resource for adult educators who need research-based assessment tools to evaluate students' reading skills to inform classroom instruction.  The planned enhancements to the site will expand the information currently provided, allow for the development of class profiles for some group instruction, and connect the profiles to appropriate assessment devices.  The maintenance and enhancement of the reading profiles website is dependent upon the findings of the Adult Reading Components (ARCS) study.  ARCS was conducted by Dr. John Strucker and Dr. Rosalind Davidson at Harvard University and is an extension of research based on proprietary data, owned by Dr. Strucker.   The results of the ARCS study and the data collected from it are currently only available through NCSALL.  Harvard College/NCSALL is uniquely qualified for this task because Harvard College/NCSALL have the right to use the data from the ARCS study and have the information available in their computer bank.

The maintenance and enhancement of this website is essential as several other federal agencies are using the profiles and related materials found on the website as an important component of their on-going efforts to improve reading instruction in adult education programs. The profiles are being used by the Office of Vocational and Adult Education (OVAE) for the STAR Reading Project.  The profiles are used by the National Center for Family Literacy (NCFL) as a component of their Adult Reading Project.  And, the profiles are used by NIFL's Equipped for the Future (EFF) Reading for Understanding Project.  In addition, the profiles are an essential component in the work of the Adult Literacy Research Working Group at NIFL that is supporting training in adult reading based on the profiles and the reading components published by the former Adult Reading Research Working Group. The NCFL, EFF, and ALWRG projects are all part of the Partnership for Reading's adult work that is covered under the No Child Left Behind legislation.  The work in each of these projects, and in this contract, requires that the reading research that forms the foundation for the work be based on scientifically-based reading research. 

In addition, the sole source contract is appropriate because Harvard College/NCSALL has the information available and can begin work immediately.  The staff is familiar with the project and does not need time to become acquainted with the task.  Because the work is so closely tied to several other government projects, the data is not available through other sources other than Harvard College/NCSALL and because the work can begin immediately, the Government has determined that the most cost-effective, best-value approach is to award a sole source contract to Harvard College/NCSALL.

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all responsible sources may submit a quotation by the date identified above. Written responses to this synopsis shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bonafide capability to fulfill the requirement. A solicitation is not available but a draft of the Statement of Work can be found on the following URL site:  http://www.nifl.gov/nifl/grants_contracts/contracts.html. A determination not to compete this proposed procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI)
 in regards to Explosives Detection Equipment for the 
USCG National Strike Force

1.0	SUBJECT

This is a Request for Information (RFI) in regards for one of the functional areas of the US Coast Guard National Strike Force (NSF).   This is not a Request For Proposal (RFP) or Request for Quote (RFQ).  Responses are requested for this RFI no later than 13  August 2004.  When responding, please follow all directions in Section 7.0.
	
2.0	DESCRIPTION

The NSF, at the request of its Commanding Officer, is seeking information from industry that will assist in the development of ideas as well as being exposed to currently market tested Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) equipment for use in Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosive (CBRNE) environments.

Specifically, this RFI seeks the following information in the areas of Explosives Detection:

Conceptual Alternatives and Ideas

·	Technical feasibility alternatives assessments
·	Approximate cost information (i.e., order of magnitude, ballpark estimates, etc.) for alternatives
·	Schedule estimates
·	Ideas and suggestions that provide alternative approaches to designing, developing, acquiring, operating, and managing NSF requirements

Tangible Market Tested Equipment

·	Information about currently market tested technologies that could support NSF 
·	Approximate cost information (i.e., order of magnitude, ballpark estimates, etc.) for alternatives
·	Approximate user training requirements (initial and recurring)
·	Certified Independent Government lab testing and official certifications for reliability, availability, and maintainability are critical.  FDA, NIOSH, NFPA, ANSI, ASME, and IEEE standards are outstanding measures of suitability.
·	ISO 9001 certification should be highlighted

<DESC>Request for Proposals (RFP) for DAAB07-03-R-P650, Amendment 0015-BAA Topic S0405 The purpose of DAAB07-03-R-P650, Amendment 0015 is for a specific RFP under Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) Solicitation DAAB07-03-R-P650, Topic S0405, entitled Antennas for Tactical and Strategic Military Communications                     The CERDEC Space & Terrestrial Communications Directorate (STCD) is interested in receiving three (3) separate proposals under BAA Solicitation DAAB07-03-R-P650, Topic S0405, entitled Antennas for Tactical and Strategic Military Communications to develop t he following products: 1) Body Wearable Antennas with form factors suitable for insertion into the Future Force Warrior (FFW) tactical combat wear to support the JTRS - SLICE frequency bands;  2) Low Profile Antennas with enhanced RF performance and mounting assemblies covering the JTRS Cluster 1 WNW frequency band; and   3) Low Loss Ballistic RF Radomes to protect low profile antennas from damage due to impacts from small arms fire-ballistic debris.    Funding for this solicitation is available in FY 05 and FY 06. Information on how to submit proposals:   Please primarily contact the technical point of contact, not the CECOM contracts office for technical based questions.   Please directly submit proposals to: Antenna Technology Team Antennas & Ancillaries Branch Wireless & JTRS Program Directorate RDECOM CERDEC S&TCD AMSRD-CER-ST-WL Myer Center, Rm 4D329A Fort Monmouth. NJ 07703-5000 Deadline for Submission of Proposals: Proposals are due to CERDEC by 4:00 PM (EDT) on 7 September 2004. Four printed copies and one electronic copy of each proposal is required.  The OfferorÃ¢Â€Â™s technical point of contactÃ¢Â€Â™s phone number, fax and email address must be provided on the pr oposalÃ¢Â€Â™s cover sheet. It is strongly recommended that the CERDEC point-of-contacts (POC) identified for each effort be contacted to schedule face-to-face meetings prior to proposal submission.   Please ask the cognizant CERDEC Technical POC if an electronic copy of your particular proposal can be submitted in addition to or in lieu of a hard copy of the proposal.  Please do not call the contracting office to ask this question.  Descriptions of the three solicitation efforts are provided below. 1)  Body Wearable Antennas    This effort requires the design, fabrication and delivery of body wearable vest and helmet antenna prototypes. Proposals should include design approaches which consider the tradeoffs between gain, bandwidth, cost, complexity, size, weight and form factor t o ensure that the deliverable prototypes present no RF hazards to the soldier, fit comfortably into the soldiersÃ¢Â€Â™ FFW tactical combat wear and that communications connectivity is adequately maintained independent of the soldiersÃ¢Â€Â™ position (standi ng, squatting, prone).  Complex designs requiring active components, electronic switching or special interfaces to the radio should not be proposed.  Offerors who were under contract with CERDEC last year to develop body wearable antenna prototypes shall a lso include in their proposals solutions addressing any performance deficiencies identified during contractor/government testing and/or a discussion of design changes to accommodate new requirements or direction from the government. The vest antenna prototype should have a form factor suitable to allow its installation into the FFWÃ¢Â€Â™s soldier ensemble chassis with the desired, but not necessarily required, location between the ceramic armor plates and outer pocket lining.  The RF frequency band of interest for the vest antenna prototypes is between 225-1000 MHz. This frequency band may be covered by a single antenna prototype design or split to accommodate a two antenna design approach (e.g., 225-500 MHz, 500-1000 MHz).  The helmet antenna should be modular with a form factor/installation mechanism to facilitate a field-retrofit int o a Kevlar or FFW helmet.  The RF frequency band of interest for the helmet antenna prototype is between 1350-2700 MHz.  A single antenna design covering this band is preferred. Separate cost breakouts are required for vests and helmets if both approaches are presented in a single proposal.  Drawings of the FFW soldier ensemble chassis/helmet will be provided to interested offerors after the offeror completes a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) with the Antenna System Integrator (ASI) for FFW.  The FFW ASI POC is: Mr. Marshall Cross      TEL 508-869-2700, FAX 508-869-2741      MegaWave Corporation      200 Shrewsbury St.      Boylston MA  01505 Period of Performance: 18 months. Deliverables/Schedule:   Four to six vest antenna prototypes (tbd)Ã¯Â‚Â§ are required NLT October 2005 in order to support the FFW Early User Evaluation in January 2006.  Four to six modular antenna prototypes (tbd) for helmetsÃ¯Â‚Â§ are required NLT  June 2006.  An expenditure report submitted electronicallyÃ¯Â‚Â§ each month.  A technical status report submitted electronically eachÃ¯Â‚Â§ quarter.  A final report submitted electronically one month after completionÃ¯Â‚Â§ of the technical effort.   Four program reviews are planned (dates TBD), twoÃ¯Â‚Â§ at CERDEC and two at the offerorÃ¢Â€Â™s facilities. CERDEC POC:  Mr. George Palafox (732) 427-2415; george.Palafox@us.army.mil 2)  Low Profile Antennas   This effort requires the design, fabrication and delivery of  low profile antenna prototypes for tactical ground platforms capable of operating over the 225-2500 MHz frequency band. Proposals should include design approaches which consider the optimal trad eoffs between gain, bandwidth, size, weight and form factor to ensure that the deliverable prototypes can be installed into the existing platform mounting hole configuration and that communications connectivity is adequately maintained. It is desired (but not required) that proposals also discuss a design approach for a variable mounting bracket which would attach to the existing mounting hole configuration, but would allow a re-positioning of the antenna prototype away from the perimeter of the platform an d more towards the platformÃ¢Â€Â™s center (e.g., a telescoping slide assembly) for improved communications performance. A separate cost breakout is required if the offeror chooses to propose a variable mounting assembly.  Offerors who were under contract w ith CERDEC last year to develop low profile antenna prototypes shall also include in their proposals solutions addressing any performance deficiencies identified during contractor/government testing and/or a discussion of design changes to accommodate new requirements or direction from the government. Period of Performance: 18 months. Deliverables/Schedule:   Three (3) Phase 1 Low Profile prototypes andÃ¯Â‚Â§ three variable mounting assemblies (if proposed) delivered 10 months after contract award in order to support Government testing at EPG.  Three (3)Ã¯Â‚Â§ Phase 2 Low Profile antenna prototypes incorporating fixes to any deficiencies identified during Government testing of the Phase 1 prototypes delivered18 months after contract award.  A short expenditure report submittedÃ¯Â‚Â§ electronically each month.  A technical status report submittedÃ¯Â‚Â§ electronically each quarter.  A final report submitted electronically oneÃ¯Â‚Â§ month after completion of the technical effort.   Four program reviews areÃ¯Â‚Â§ planned (dates TBD), two at CERDEC and two at the offerorÃ¢Â€Â™s facilities. CERDEC POC:  Mr. Tat Fung (732) 532-4200; tat.fung@us.army.mil 3)  Low Loss Ballistic Radomes   This effort requires the design, fabrication and delivery of ballistic radome(s) with low RF losses over the 225-2500 MHz frequency band for use with Low Profile antennas on tactical ground platforms. Ballistic radomes are required to reduce the susceptibi lity to damage from ballistic impacts from  small arms fire and destructive debris fields from exploded missiles. Proposals should discuss design approaches which consider high strength materials, bandwidth/loss performance, size, weight and ability to be modified to meet various low profile antenn a form factors.  The dimensions of a low profile antenna will be provided to interested offerors during face-to-face discussions at Fort Monmouth prior to proposal submission.  A Non-Disclosure Agreement with the Low Profile antenna manufacturer may be required. Period of Performance: 12 months. Deliverables/Schedule:   One (1) low loss ballistic radome which can be installed on a low profileÃ¯Â‚Â§ antenna prototype (tbd)  A short expenditure report submitted electronicallyÃ¯Â‚Â§ each month.  A technical status report submitted electronically eachÃ¯Â‚Â§ quarter.  A final report submitted electronically one month after completionÃ¯Â‚Â§ of the technical effort.   Two program reviews are planned (dates TBD), oneÃ¯Â‚Â§ at CERDEC and one at the offerorÃ¢Â€Â™s facilities.

<SUBJECT>Approach to Procure the Design and Fabrication of Rolling Stock (Cask and Buffer Cars) for the OCRWM Program
<DESC>NOTICE OF PROGRAM INTEREST SUBJECT:  Approach to Procure the Design and Fabrication of Rolling Stock (Cask and Buffer Cars) for the OCRWM Program AGENCY:   U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ SUMMARY The Department of Energy (DOE) is issuing this Notice of Program Interest (NOPI) to obtain input from rolling stock vendors regarding DOE's approach to procuring the design and fabrication of rolling stock for shipping spent nuclear fuel (SNF) and high-level radioactive waste (HLW) to a monitored geologic repository (MGR) at Yucca Mountain, Nevada.  DOE is responsible, under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA), for accepting and transporting spent nuclear fuel from commercial nuclear reactor sites and HLW and SNF from DOE facilities for ultimate disposal.  An overview of the program, including the anticipated project schedule, is provided in Appendix A.  DOE is considering the design and fabrication of the rolling stock needed for this purpose. The required rolling stock includes: a.) Cask Cars to carry HLW and SNF transportation casks, b.) Escort Cars to accommodate personnel accompanying the trains, c.) Buffer Cars to provide a physical separation between cars carrying SNF/HLW and those occupied by personnel, and d.) Locomotives to haul the cars. All of these vehicles, except the locomotives, must conform to American Association of Railroads (AAR) Performance Specification S-2043 (Appendix C). With this notice, the DOE seeks comments from rolling stock vendors concerning the appropriate structure for a procurement process that meets the objectives of the spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste management program and is attractive to potential bidders.  Your comments will help DOE refine the process and will provide a basis for the discussions with vendors in the initial stage of the process described below. Potential proposers are asked to provide feedback (that may be proprietary) to the Government on: a.) Commercially available technology that responds to Government requirements and strategy, b.) Issues that would discourage potential proposers from responding to the solicitation, and c.) Recommendations for improvement. This notice applies solely to Cask Cars and Buffer Cars.  Further details of the anticipated requirements for the Cask and Buffer Cars may be found in Appendices B1 and B2 (Appendices for this notice may be obtained at http://www.ocrwm.doe.gov/wat/procure.shtml).  It is anticipated that DOE will select more than one vendor for these car types.  Each of the vendors will complete the design and fabrication of one prototype Cask Car and one prototype Buffer Car, test their respective prototype cars at the Transportation Test Center in Pueblo, CO and obtain certification of their designs by the AAR. It is then anticipated that vendors will be invited to submit proposals for final design and fabrication of a fleet of up to one hundred and twenty (120) Cask Cars and up to sixty (60) Buffer Cars in accordance with the certified designs.  DOE will then select the preferred design and manufacturer for the Cask and Buffer cars. DOE is planning to conduct this procurement in the following stages: 1. Meetings with individual vendors (August/September 2004) DOE will schedule meetings of up to two hours with individual designers and fabricators of rolling stock.  These meetings will allow potential proposers to share information with the DOE and obtain clarification of any of the issues outlined below.  Potential proposers may distribute written information regarding their products and capabilities for use during the meeting. After the meeting they may either collect their information or leave it for staff review.  If proprietary information is left with the DOE, the pages that are considered to be proprietary should be either stamped or headed to identify those pages.  The two-hour meetings will be held in August/September 2004. Vendors are allowed to bring no more than five people. The meetings will be held in the Forrestal Building, 1000 Independence Avenue, Washington, D.C. DOE will schedule meetings with the points of contact identified on vendors' letters of interest. 2. Draft RFP (Late FY2004) It is anticipated that DOE will publish a Draft RFP on the FedBizOpps website (http://www.fedbizopps.gov/) for formal comments from the potential vendors and other interested parties. 3. Pre-Solicitation Conference (Early FY 2005) The DOE is planning to hold an open-forum meeting for all parties interested in this procurement.  The final time, place and other details will be announced on the FedBizOpps website and by e-mail to points of contact identified during the initial vendor meetings. 4. Final RFP (Early FY2005) It is anticipated that the DOE will publish the final Request for Proposals on the FedBizOpps website for vendor response. 5. Award(s) (FY2005) It is anticipated that the DOE will select a vendor or vendors FY2005. The Department is interested in vendor comments on the following issues. 1. Criteria for selecting design fabrication vendors.  DOE has initially identified the following selection criteria: a.) Technical capability to develop designs matching the unique characteristics of the Cask and Buffer Cars; b.) Cost-effectiveness of the design in fabrication, operation, and maintenance; c.) Prior successful history of designing and manufacturing similar types of railcars; d.) Ability to obtain certification for the new designs; e.) Corporate experience/past performance/record of integrity; f.) Corporate financial capacity and stability; g.) Qualifications of key personnel; and h.) Ability to meet schedule requirements.     * Are these selection criteria sufficient?     * Do you suggest modifications or additions? 2. Phases of the procurement.  DOE is considering this procurement of Cask and Buffer Cars to occur in two phases:  a.) Car Design / Prototype Fabrication and Testing:  Contractors shall individually provide  detailed designs, fabricate complete prototypes, complete analysis and testing at the  Transportation Test Center to demonstrate the designs' conformance with AAR Standard S-  2043, and obtain certificates of compliance from AAR.  The designs shall also demonstrate  quality attributes and safety provisions, performance characteristics and the operations and  maintenance concept and ability to be manufactured.  b.) Production:  A single contractor, selected from those that have completed the Car  Design / Prototype Fabrication and Testing phase, shall provide final designs incorporating  any changes required to obtain certification, as well as final design for production, and shall  fabricate the number of cars specified by DOE.    * Is this procurement phasing appropriate? Would another approach be advisable?  If        so, please describe.    * Are two discreet car designs necessary, or may it be possible, economical, or        practicable to design and manufacture one car type to fulfill the purposes of both the        Cask and Buffer Cars?   * What is your opinion of the level of interest among equipment designers and       manufacturers given DOE's proposed procurement approach?   * Would your firm be interested in responding to this solicitation given DOE's proposed       procurement approach (selection of multiple firms for design, development of a       prototype and testing and single selection of firm for manufacturing)?   * Would you need to team with other firms or can your firm individually respond to the RFP? 3. Commercial provisions:  Please address the optimal business, contractual and pricing arrangements that should be employed to meet design, prototype and fabrication requirements for these cars.  In particular address the following:  a.) Competition:  How competition can be maximized throughout the  design/prototype/fabrication process.  b.) Separate design: Please address whether, as an alternative, it is feasible and/or  advantageous for DOE to procure a design, followed by a separate contract for prototype  and fabrication.   * Would it be beneficial for the government to divide the procurement into separate       contracts for the Cask Cars and the Buffer Cars?   * If the Cask and Buffer Cars were built to different designs, would there be any      advantage or disadvantage to awarding the manufacture of Cask Cars to one supplier      and the manufacture of Buffer Cars to another?  Is the number of cars in the order a      factor into your response?   * Do you foresee any difficulty for potential contractors to obtain bonding for any phase(s)       of the project?   * Have you conducted business with the federal government before?   * Have you had any experiences that may cause you not to participate in this project?   * Have you learned any lessons that you care to share?   * Have you any suggestions for design issues that DOE should look out for? 4. Contract pricing:  DOE anticipates the use of Firm-Fixed-Price contract vehicles for all contract actions and phases.   * Would another approach such as time and materials or cost reimbursement be more       appropriate for a particular phase?  Please explain why another approach would be more       appropriate.   * What pricing terms allow for an equitable sharing of risk on each phase?   * Does your firm possess a government-approved accounting system that will allow the       use of cost reimbursement contracts?   * Do you have comments with respect to suitable pricing arrangements?   * Do you think that an incentive program to exceed scheduled project milestones is a mild       or strong motivator or any for that matter? In addition to addressing these questions please feel free to provide any other relevant input or suggestions regarding contract-pricing terms. 5. Information requirements:  Please define any other types of technical and commercial information / data vendors may need to enable a complete and competitive proposal to be submitted. 6. Collaboration:  To support DOE's Program¡Vwide objectives, contractors may be required to collaborate and interface with other vendors (e.g.: Escort Cars, Locomotives, vehicle testing at TTCI, Casks, Maintenance Facility) on a given task or requirement.  Please address how this collaboration may be achieved and the business considerations with other vendors that will limit the level of collaboration that is possible. 7. Performance incentives:  Please describe incentives that could be employed through a contract to encourage excellent performance, compliance with schedule requirements and cost reductions.  Where possible please discuss:  a.) The metrics that should be employed;  b.) The frequency and method of data collection associated with metrics; and  c.) Positive or negative financial actions associated with the metrics. 8. Regulatory requirements: Please identify any technology or regulatory challenges or barriers associated with the design, development and fabrication of the Cask Cars and Buffer Cars.  In particular, address the impact of AAR Standard S-2043 on the design and production of the Cask and Buffer Cars, whether as adaptations of existing designs or completely new designs. 9. On-going design efforts: Please identify any on-going design efforts directed toward the development of new or modified rolling stock that could be employed to meet the required Cask and Buffer Cars and consist functionalities. Appendices for this notice may be obtained at http://www.ocrwm.doe.gov/wat/procure.shtml. Please provide your responses to the above questions by email in a Microsoft Word file to reggie.james@rw.doe.gov no later than August 6, 2004.  Please limit your comments and responses to no more than 10 pages.  No proprietary data should be included in data file that is submitted to the DOE. Cask and Buffer Car Vendor Meetings: The meeting to discuss DOE's approach for procuring Cask and Buffer cars is an opportunity for vendors to share ideas, suggestions and questions regarding this procurement with the DOE. Vendors may want to share information with DOE regarding corporate history and experience at these meetings.  This is appropriate to the extent that it is applicable to Cask and Buffer cars procurement.  It is expected that this portion of the vendor discussion will be limited to about ten minutes. During the proposal preparation process, the vendors will have the opportunity to submit a significant amount of information to the DOE on their corporate performance, abilities, experience and initiatives.  DOE will be able to learn more of the corporate qualifications as the proposals are evaluated. For the NOPI meetings, the DOE is focused on receiving input from the different vendors and organizations that will provide insight and direction for the DOE preparation of the Request for Proposals (RFP) which will determine the nature and type of contract that will be used for the procurement.  Therefore, the primary discussion for these meetings should be focused on the vendor's responses to the issues listed in the NOPI.  Vendors could discuss any suggestions for improvement, any foreseeable problems for the DOE, and any issues DOE may have omitted. With input gathered from the NOPI meetings, the DOE will prepare a draft RFP and publish it for comments.  The comments received on the draft will be incorporated into the final RFP as appropriate. The meetings will be held in the Forrestal Building, 1000 Independence Ave. DOE will provide a laptop computer with PowerPoint, a projector connected to the computer and a screen for the meeting. Please complete the form in Appendix D as soon as possible and return by email to reggie.james@rw.doe.gov United States Department of Energy Office of Business Support Attention: Reggie R.

<SUBJECT>National Electric Grid Monitoring System - Sources Sought
<DESC>The Government anticipates contracting for services to implement a National Electric Grid Monitoring System (NEGMS) based on two initiatives proposed between the U.S Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and portions of the electric utility industry.  The two initiatives consist of a near real-time portion of the system requiring manual entry of data and a real-time portion of the system using automated data entry.  This project seeks to finalize the design concepts of these two initiatives, provide a detailed design for both, and to implement at least an initial phase of both these initiatives including the initial installation of the system.  A key component to achieving these goals will be the ongoing collaboration among key electric sector organizations, the Government, and the Contractor for this effort. The purpose of the system is to aid the DHS in maintaining a situational awareness of the state of the nation's electrical grid and to share this information with the electricity sector.  This system will initially operate between the DHS and a limited number of the North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) Reliability Coordinator (RC) Region sites. The concept for the near real-time portion of the NEGMS is for personnel at each individual participating RC site to manually enter via a computer monitor information into a preformatted spreadsheet  The spreadsheet will use this information to automatically characterize the condition or "status" of the RC Region's grid.  This spreadsheet information and the "status" condition for each participating RC region will be communicated to and stored at the DHS. Each participating RC region will also have access to the spreadsheet and "status" information for each RC region via access to DHS.  Visualization capabilities will be provided at DHS in the form of maps with graphical information.  The visualization information will also be available at the RC sites via access to DHS.  A selective text messaging capability will exist between DHS and the RC sites. The concept for the real-time portion of the NEGMS is to provide DHS with various electrical system indices calculated from selected raw electrical system data for each participating RC region.  The indices will serve the purpose of providing information to DHS to characterize the state of the grid in presentation formats that are easy to understand and interpret.  An RC NEGMS Server function will be developed for use at each RC site to obtain the raw data from the RC's Energy Management System (EMS) server.  The RC NEGMS Server function will be capable of accepting and converting the RC's EMS vendor-specific data into an open mainstream data format for use by the real-time system.  The server function will also derive from the data the various electrical indices that will be used to characterize the "status" of the RC Region's grid.  The development of these indices and the "status" values will be determined using algorithms the contractor will develop or finalize in collaboration with the Government and the participating RCs.  These RC indices and "status" values will be communicated to DHS via a system communications network and stored there for use by DHS personnel.  Visualization capabilities, which will probably include displaying and trending of various indices superimposed on a map, will be developed for use at DHS.  Similar to the near-real time portion of NEGMS these indices and visual information for each participating RC will be available to each participating RC through access to the "database" at DHS.  This portion of the system will also have a selective text messaging capability between DHS and the RC sites. Additional NEGMS system functions will be required to be available at DHS to effectively utilize data such as a functional application to allow for additional inference and index calculations to be performed at DHS based on all information available at DHS.  This may include information not obtained through the NEGMS. The Contractor should be capable of designing a NEGMS to facilitate future modifications and additions with relative ease including the expandability of system functions and applications and the ability to meet increased bandwidth requirements.  This implies a strong preference for the use of industry standard approaches (e.g., protocols, data formats, widely used commercial database management systems, openly accessible interfaces, languages, etc.) and an avoidance of proprietary solutions.  The system will comply with NERC Cyber Security Standards as a minimum.  The contractor will also provide system testing and training. The purpose of this announcement is to determine the capabilities and interest from organizations of all sizes, including small businesses or combinations of small businesses, that have the requisite breadth and depth of experience and capabilities in the various technical, engineering, security, acquisition, business, and other disciplines that would be needed to successfully implement the NEGMS.  Organizations deeming themselves qualified are requested to provide a brief description of their capabilities and experience in these or related areas. The information provided should specifically address the following points: 1) Whether or not the organization has qualified and relevant staff with Government security clearance(s).  If it does, please specify at what security level and with what Government agency(ies); 2) The organization's experience in performing work for Government agencies, particularly the DHS, including the nature of the work and how the experience may be relevant to the specific capabilities necessary to perform this project; 3) The organization's experience in performing work for the electric utility sector, particularly for any of the NERC Reliability Coordinator Regions, including the nature of the work and how the experience may be relevant to the specific capabilities necessary to perform this project; 4) The organization's experience in designing and implementing a system that required the demonstration of similar capabilities to those necessary to perform the project described in this document; 5) The organization's expertise related to the nation's electrical transmission grid including its understanding of the importance and interrelationship of various grid parameters to each other and to the proper functioning of the electrical grid.  This knowledge is important for engaging with industry in discussions regarding the relevance of the information being provided through the NEGMS to meeting both Government's and industry's needs and for exploring methods for making the "initial phase" effort more effective including the development of relevant indicators for the status of the electrical grid; 6)Any other information the organization deems relevant to demonstrating its overall capabilities to successfully perform this entire project. In addition to the information identified above, all responses must include the name and address of the responding organization, the name and contact information for a contact person within that organization, and a statement of the organization's size status and any applicable socio-economic designations, i.e.  8(a) small business, HUBzone small business, etc. THIS REQUEST IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS BUT MERELY A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. Responses should be submitted in MS Word format, not to exceed five (5) pages in length, be single spaced with 1" margins (top, bottom, left, right), and when printed should fit on size 8 1/2" by 11" paper.  The type must be legible and not smaller than 10 point.  You are discouraged from including large pictures or charts in your response. An e-mail message containing the Word file as an attachment must be submitted to the Contract Specialist, Keith Carrington, at keith.carrington@netl.doe.gov no later than Thursday, July 22, 2004.  The Government has determined that the technical information included in this notice is sufficient in detail for an organization to determine whether or not it possesses the capabilities to meet these requirements.  Therefore, questions of a technical nature are discouraged as it is anticipated that no additional technical information will be made available for this requirement at this time.  All other questions regarding this notice should be directed to Mr. Carrington, at (304) 285-4456, or at the e-mail address listed above.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) will host its Fifth Annual National Small Business Conference on July 6-9, 2004, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania at the Philadelphia Marriott-Downtown. The purpose of the conference is to reach out to small businesses -- including Small Disadvantaged, Women-owned, 8(A), HUB Zone and Service-Disabled Veteran-owned businesses -- to assist them in contracting with DOE.  The conference plays a major role in providing procurement guidance and contracting opportunities to small business. The conference will bring together representatives of the Department, its prime contractors, our network of National Laboratories, and several other Federal agencies to provide valuable information about business lines and upcoming contracting opportunities at DOE and at other agencies as well. The Department continues to be committed to fully engaging small businesses, including small disadvantaged, 8(a), women-owned businesses, HUB Zone, and Service-Disabled Veteran-owned small business concerns, in DOE's core missions.  DOE has exciting opportunities to offer small businesses in the areas of commodities, administrative services, science, security, and environmental quality and energy resources.  Features of this year?s conference include: -- Plenary sessions with prominent government, corporate, and business leaders; -- A business exposition that will allow businesses to showcase their products and services to the hundreds of government and business attendees; and, -- A Matchmaking Forum that will provide a unique opportunity to schedule one-on-one       meetings with procurement representatives from DOE?s prime contractors and share in over $300 million of possible subcontracting opportunities within Fiscal Year 2004. DOE has received positive reviews on the previous conferences. This year's conference will continue to provide the essential information and guidance needed to do business with the Department.  It is through outreach activities such as this that the Department finds small businesses with the capabilities to match its contracting opportunities.   For more information or to register, please visit the conference website at http://www.smallbusiness-outreach.doe.gov/ (please cut and paste this link in your browser if clinking on it does not work).

<SUBJECT>Open Solicitation for The Materials Disposition Basic Ordering Agreement
<DESC>Introduction: The Government desires to divest itself of surplus Material such as scrap metal, equipment, vehicles, etc., that cannot be made available to the general public.  The Material is currently located at sites across the Government complex.  The Material is believed to have some value to certain commercial enterprises, therefore, the Material is not considered waste.  The Material meets the definition of personal property as stated in the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  Some of the Material may be radioactively contaminated and regulated under The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 as amended. Interested firms should check the ORO Procurement Website for more information at http://www.oro.doe.gov/procurement/cur_sol.html Background: The federal government and in particular the U.S. Department of Energy Complex has an indeterminate amount of potentially contaminated radioactive Material that could be recycled, reused or buried.  The Material is in the form of small to large pieces of metal, structural steel, equipment and vehicles.  The Material may be in scrap piles, outside locations and stored in containers, and/or it may be located within underutilized or abandoned facilities. In some cases the Material may be attached and/or part of the building in which they are located. Scope: General ? The Contractor shall disposition the Material by decontamination, sorting, segregating, or by other means, processing the Material at the Contractor?s facility(ies).  The requirements shall be specified in each order.  Hereafter referred to as ?order(s)?.  The order may include removal, characterization, packaging, and transportation to the Contractor?s facility. Security ? The requiring organization shall make the determination if the Material has security concerns.  If the Material to be dispositioned requires special handling or processing due to classification, Unclassified Controlled Nuclear Information (UCNI), or Export Controlled Information (ECI) specific requirements shall be detailed within the individual orders.  It is anticipated that such requirements will be minimal, but where applicable shall likely require certified destruction or reconfiguration of the affected Material. Where required, methods of destruction or reconfiguration may be proposed by the contractor for approval by the organization issuing the order. Contractors may not be able to perform those orders requiring security clearances until such clearances are obtained. Radioactive Property - When the Material subject to transfer is radioactively or potentially contaminated the contractor shall comply with federal requirements for all activities performed at that site.  It is anticipated only minimal decontamination processing to expedite handling, loading, and transporting of the Material will be permitted at the federal work site. Material located at the contractor?s facilities shall be managed and regulated in accordance with the terms and conditions of its NRC or NRC Agreement State license. Environment, Safety and Health (ES&H) and Quality Assurance (QA) - The ES&H and QA requirements will likely vary with each order depending on what work (if any) will be performed on the government?s site.  If the order requires dismantling for parts or equipment on a government site there would likely be additional ES&H and QA requirements.  The organization issuing the order shall be required to detail the ES&H and QA requirements associated with a given order. Onsite Actions, Packaging, and Transportation - For some tasks, the contractor shall be responsible for removal of the Material from designated facilities and/or storage areas.  Onsite actions shall be defined by each order.  The requiring organization shall provide the best information available on the description, characterization, and history of the Material.  The removal and transportation of the Material by the Contractor shall be done in compliance with all applicable State, Federal, and local laws and regulations. Title and Possession ? The government?s intent is to transfer title to all the Material at some point in the disposition process. The point of title transfer and possession shall be clearly defined in each order. Possession shall occur no later than at the point of receipt at the Contractor?s facility. If there are no security concerns with the material under an order, title transfer will likely be concurrent. If the Material has security concerns the title will transfer after the security concerns are resolved and prior to any unrestricted release of Material or final disposition of the Material. Applicable Directives: 1. The Contractor shall maintain all required licenses/permits to conduct the scope of each applicable task, including shipping, storage, handling and waste disposal. 2. The Contractor shall perform all work in accordance with federal, state, and local rules, regulations and standards and within the limits of the Contractor?s permit or license. 3. The Contractor shall comply with quality assurance requirements as established by Nuclear Quality Assurance manual (NQA-1), Quality Assurance Program Requirements for Nuclear Facilities. 4. Any other applicable organization directives (e.g. DOE Orders and/or Site-specific procedures) shall be specified in each order. Performance Requirements: Specific performance requirements shall be delineated for each order. General Requirements -The Department of Energy, Oak Ridge Operations, National Center of Excellence for Metals Recycle (NMR) is the sponsor of this BOA. NMR reserves the right to conduct annual quality assurance audits to the requirements of the Contractor?s NRC or NRC Agreement State license.  All organizations that issue orders under this BOA will rely on the NMR annual audits and shall not conduct their own.  If NMR finds major concerns during an audit, the Contractor shall not be allowed to participate in the competition for any orders until the finding is corrected and approved by NMR.  NMR, or a contractor for NMR, may also conduct surveillance. 1. The Contractor shall have the legal authority to possess and process radioactive materials, such as a NRC license or NRC Agreement State radioactive material license. 2. The Contractor shall comply with all applicable Federal and State requirements including EPA, OSHA, DOT and NRC/NRC Agreement State regulations. The Contractor shall notify DOE if any of their licenses or permits has expired, been revoked, or is under any other action by regulators that shall not allow the Contractor to accept Material for processing. 3. The Contractor shall provide DOE the results of regulatory audits conducted, or Notices of Violations issued by regulators. 4. The Contractor shall have health and safety programs that meet the requirements of their licenses or permits to handle Material in the specific order. Deliverables For each order the Contractor shall provide an annual Mass Balance Report in accordance with the attached format delineating the Material dispositioned under that order to the BOA Administrator listed in Article 3. One copy shall also be provided to the activity or site issuing the order. Annual Mass Balance Reports shall be due on February 1st for the previous year. Additional deliverables may be specified in each order.

<DESC>The Department of State, Overseas Buildings Operations (OBO), continues to expand the base of firms with which it does business.  To that end, OBO will host its third Industry Day on Wednesday, October 13, 2004 at the Ronald Reagan Building.

Industry Day hours are:  10:00am – 4:00pm.  OBO uses an industry-wide, cross-section of services, equipment, construction and operations for its embassy facilities around the world.  The technical expertise that is required runs the gamut of the building industry.  Real estate service providers are used in support of acquisitions and disposal actions (including brokerage, marketing and appraisals).  Planning, architectural, engineering, interior design and general construction services are used, as well as  maintenance services and generator, roof and fire protection systems replacements.  We are interested in construction materials and building components that promote sustainability and high performance, and other new technology.  There is a growing demand to supply building components and systems that can withstand blast and bio-chemical environmental security and operational compromise.  After selection for a contract or after pre-qualification for any contracts that require a security clearance,  firms and vendors must have or be able to obtain a facility security clearance.  The Department of State will sponsor  those selected or pre-qualified firms that do not possess facility clearances.  Roomers, Inc. will handle registration on behalf of OBO.  Interested parties should register before September 17, 2004.  There will be a nominal registration fee of  $85.  To register, click www.roomersinc.com.

<SUBJECT>A -- Proposer's Day Announcement - Persistent Ocean Surveillance (POS)
<DESC>PROPOSERS DAY CONFERENCE: The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) will host a Proposers Day Conference in support of the Persistent Ocean Surveillance (POS) Program Broad Agency Announcement BAA04-33 on 31 August 2004 at Schafer Corporation, 3811 N. Fairfax Drive Suite 400, Arlington, VA beginning at 9:00am with an anticipated ending time of 5:00pm. 

The POS program will enable naval forces to conduct maritime operations in the presence of diesel submarine threats and surface craft capable of launching anti-access weapons. To effect rapid kill of anti-access defenses requires the deployment of networked sensors (agents) that are persistent and pervasive throughout the littoral. This effort will demonstrate the feasibility of a floating field of smart, long-term, station-keeping sensors capable of observing the ocean environment at a known location over an extended period of time. The program will exploit local environmental effects (wind, waves, solar energy, temperature differentials, etc.), and geo-location technologies to establish long-term, station keeping ocean environment sensors. The anticipated products are: 1) Station-keeping and energy harvesting technologies using local environmental effects capable of maintaining less than a 250m watch radius for 90% of the time and a 2,500 meter watch radius for 100% of the time over a four week period in currents as high as 2 knots; and 2) Prototype (tactical sized) ocean sensing buoy with continuous RF communications. DARPA is seeking concepts that will provide either an entirely new military capability or will enhance existing capability by orders of magnitude (based on demonstrable relevant metrics), rather than extensions to existing systems or minor improvements to present capability.

The purpose of the conference is to provide program information, address questions from potential proposers, and provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities for teaming opportunities. A portion of the conference agenda will be reserved for presentations by prospective proposers who wish to present company overviews and discuss their POS-relevant technology expertise. Presentations may contain up to five (5) slides and will be limited to five (5) minutes followed by five (5) minutes of question/answer if needed. All material will be subject to review by DARPA for sensitive but unclassified information. It is the presenter?s responsibility to ensure that all material that is presented is approved by the organization that funded the research. Proposers interested in making presentations should contact Mr. Mark Kaczmarek (mkaczmarek@schafertmd.com) by 24 August 2004 for scheduling. An electronic copy of the presentation slides must be provided to Mr. Kaczmarek by 24 August 2004 for prior review by DARPA.

Registration for the Proposers Day Conference is on-line at https://www.schafertmd.com/POS. If on-line registration is not possible, please contact Mr. Kaczmarek by e-mail no later than 24 August 2004 to register. Foreign nationals will be required to complete and return the DARPA Foreign National Visitor Request (DARPA Form 60) no later than 24 August 2004 if they wish to attend the conference. 

Attendance at the Proposers Day Conference is not required to propose to any BAA that may be associated with this technology area. Updates to program information will be posted as necessary to http://www.darpa.mil/ato/solicit/POS/index.htm.

The NETL is a single organization, however, we have two physical locations or "sites".  The main NETL library is located in Morgantown, WV and a satellite library is located in Pittsburgh, PA (approximately 70 miles apart). Subscriptions involving "e access" must indicate whether the price quoted will cover BOTH location "sites" or whether publishing requirements require two subscriptions, one for each location or "site".  Specific offeror definition of a "site" for institutional licenses needs to be addressed by the offeror in a manner which is clear and concise when quoting a price. In some instances the NETL requires a paper copy of a journal or other subscription as well as "e access".  On line items where this requirement is noted the price quotation must indicate if the "e access" is included in the package or, if not, the price quotation shall indicate: 1. Cost for paper only. 2. Cost for "e access" only. 3. Cost for paper and "e access" combined If  a vendor cannot quote on a particular line item then "No Quote" or "No Bid" shall be inserted for that line item price, DO NOT LEAVE A BLANK SPACE. DO NOT CHANGE THE ORDER OF THE LINE ITEMS.  If a price quotation is submitted in an alternate format, the line items must be maintained in the order they were received on the Request for Price Quotation (RFQ). NO EXCEPTIONS TO THIS SPECIFICATION, DO NOT CHANGE THE ORDER OF THE LINE ITEMS. In the event the exact name of a publication being quoted is different than the line item submitted on the RFQ the vendor will put the correct name of the publication below the name of the publication on the RFQ in order to avoid confusion on items being purchased. Vendors must be able to provide service to both NETL facilities, NO EXCEPTIONS. Evaluation of cost proposals for multiple awards may be determined to be in the best interest of the Government on the basis of administrative costs of multiple awards.  For evaluation purposes, $500 will be used as the estimated cost for administration of each additional award. Price quotations may be submitted by either of the following methods by the date and time indicated in this combined synopsis/solicitation document: 1. Via email to:   franklin@netl.doe.gov in an easy to open format, no unusual software packages may be used in preparing the price quotations. 2. Via fax to:  D. Franklin at 304-285-0986.

<DESC>Federal Lands Highway Project Development and Design Manual and A/E Contracting Procedures Manual.  The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Office of Federal Lands Highway (FLH) is making a comprehensive revision and electronic publication of its Project Development and Design Manual (PDDM).  The PDDM provides technical and policy guidance for the interdisciplinary project development and design-related activities performed by the three field Divisions of the FLH and its consultants.  The PDDM currently exists in MS Word format and on the web in Adobe PDF format at http://www.wfl.fha.dot.gov/design/manual/.  

FLH is also developing an electronic publication of its A/E Contract Procedures Manual.  The manual will document the A/E procurement, administration and evaluation processes performed by the three field Divisions of the FLH.  It will provide administrative, technical and policy guidance to contract mangers.  The completed manual may range between 300 and 500 pages including narratives explaining duties/processes, sample forms, generic contracts, checklists, and example letters and memorandums.  

The Statement of Work (SOW) is to research, evaluate, implement, and document the best practices for publishing and maintaining the PDDM, and for publishing an A/E Manual, in electronic media format, including MS Word, Adobe PDF, and HTML web-based formats.  Best practices for preparation of the manuals will be identified through research of available web-based highway design and technical manuals published by state departments of transportation and other state or federal agencies.  The work includes technical editing of the existing PDDM to include dual units of measurement (SI units followed by US Customary units in parenthesis), updating the PDDM with incorporation of latest references to related documents and policies as identified by the FHWA, removal of designated content, and incorporation of new content as furnished by the FHWA.  

The work also includes combining government provided data into an A/E Manual that will benefit the contract manager, technical editing of the manual, updating the manual with incorporation of latest references to related documents and policies as identified by the FHWA, and incorporation of new content as furnished by the FHWA.  The work includes modification of the existing Manual format to include best available web-based document management tools for user-friendly navigation and organization, such as hyperlink text for electronic references (both to external reference documents and internally within the manuals), highly functional search and help tools, printing tools, and other useful enhancements.  The work includes documenting all formatting parameters that are used as an electronic style guide, and developing an operational manual for maintaining the document with future revisions using the established format.  

The work required for both the PDDM and A/E Contracting Manual will be awarded as one contract.  FOR A COMPLETE SOW THAT INCLUDES DELIVERABLES, PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE, PRICING, AND EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD, VISIT OUR WEB SITE AT http://www.cflhd.gov/.

52.212-1	Instruction to Offerors- Commercial Items (Jan 2004)
52.212-2	Evaluation- Commercial Items (Jan 1999), award will be made utilizing the following factors, in descending order of importance, The Coast Guard intends to award one contract to the Contractor whose proposal is identified as offering the best value solution.

§	The selection team may determine the best value for the Coast Guard merits a higher price based on technical superiority.  The selection, using sound business judgment, will base the selection decision on an integrated assessment of the proposal’s relative capability as measured against the below evaluation factors:

o	Factor 1 – Schedule
o	Factor 2 – Technical/Management Solution/Approach
o	Factor 3 – Past Performance
o	Factor 4 – Cost/Price

Factor 1 is the most important.  However, while the price is an important part of the integrated selection decision, the non-price factors are significantly more important than the price factor.  However, as the technical and schedule elements of  the quotes become substantially equal, price may be the determining factor in selecting a proposal for award.



Enclosure (1) Detailed Factors








							



DETAILED FACTORS

FACTOR 1:   SCHEDULE 

A schedule which meets USCG requirements and demonstrates an understanding of the time required to perform and document the work. Any  proposed schedule will be evaluated for reasonableness and ability to meet the stated required schedule.
FACTOR 2:	TECHNICAL/MANAGEMENT SOLUTION/APPROACH

	Technical factors which include a proposed contract breakdown structure that identifies the services to be delivered to meet the mission requirements set forth in the performance work statement, a sound partnering approach to management that demonstrates the ability to aggressively identify and apply information technology solutions to business processes.  The Contractor’s validated process and procedures that ensure high quality performance which indicate a highly probability of a quality outcome for the aircraft refurbishment without harming the environment or compromising flight safety. Evidence of ability to maintain a quality system acceptable to the Coast Guard.  Impact of environmental characteristics of all products proposed and any enhancement or mitigation provided by filters, gas burning, or other technology. Provide statement describing environmental licensing and permitting for proposed paint and stripping process and materials. Evidence of proper facility FAA certification and evidence of required environmental licensing and permitting to accomplish the proposed work are required. Vendors detailed work statement and process descriptions.  

FACTOR 3:     PAST PERFORMANCE

Past Performance will consider documentation for having performed installation, repair, and paint of similar or like items.  Past performance will consider the information from  existing and former customers during the past 2 years.  References will be asked about quality and schedule performance of the Vendor.  Any conversations with present or former customers will be documented.  The past performance factor will be based on adherence to ability to perform a successful installation, a successful repair, a quality paint job, delivery schedule, and willingness and ability of contractor to resolve problems.  
FACTOR 4:	PRICE RELATED FACTORS

Comparison of quotes against the Government estimate and review each quote for level of work offered based on number of labor hours, hourly rates, and material costs to evaluate price reasonableness.  Cost fully burdened to deliver and return the aircraft based on a location, which includes man-hours, gas, usage of airplane, and a wear and tear calculation will be added to the quote to assess overall cost to the Government.
 
Realism: A realism assessment will be accomplished by technical review and evaluation of the skill mix, specific hours, and material kinds and quantity for each identified CLIN/Sub-CLIN in the Vendor's Quote.  The intent of the evaluation is to determine whether the estimated proposed price/cost elements are realistic for the work to be performed; reflect a clear understanding of the requirements; and are consistent with the approach described in the Offeror's technical proposal.

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

"Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

"Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 

(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- 

(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 

“Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 

(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 

(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.

(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;

(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

						Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>AMENDMENT 0001 TO REQUEST FOR
QUOTATIONS N00421-04-T-0189
The purpose of this amendment (0001) is to answers questions received from potential offerors.  The hour and date for submission of quotations is NOT changed and remains 3:00p.m. (EDT) on 6 August 2004.

NOTE TO OFFERORS:  You must acknowledge receipt of this amendment prior to the hour and date specified for receipt of offers by either signing and returning one copy of the amendment (separate from your offer, but prior to the hour and date for receipt of offers) or by signing and returning one copy of the amendment with your offer.  If you have already submitted a quote, you may change your quote in response to this amendment and include acknowledgement of the amendment in one of the forms noted, provided the changed quote makes reference to this amendment and is received prior to the hour and date for receipt of offers.    

QUESTION 1:  (Paraphrased)  In the reference of Solicitation No. N00421-04-T-0189, would you please provide us more specific information about the elements.  

ANSWER 1:  Generally, wattmeters require plug-in elements to determine the power rating and frequency range.  Therefore, depending on the product offered, plug-in elements may be necessary to meet the Government’s minimum Frequency Range (L-Band 1-2 Ghz) and Power Rating (100mW to 10W).  Thus, offerors shall quote quantities and pricing for the elements.  

For example, this Request for Quotation cites a specific product from a manufacturer/supplier.  This product requires SIX (6) each 25K plug-in elements (L-Band) AND SIX (6) each 2.5K plug-in elements (L-Band) to meet the Government’s minimum specifications.  (That is, each of the three wattmeters to be procured requires two of each of the two plug-in elements identified for a total of six each.)  Another offeror’s product may require different elements and quantities to meet the Government’s minimum specifications (stated above), and that offeror should quote the type and quantities, as well as price, for its elements.

Based on this response, the Government anticipates quotes that cite a line item for the wattmeters (3 each) and a line item for plug-in elements (the quoter will cite the quantities based on their product).  It is noted that more than one additional line item may be required for plug-in elements (as in the example, one for 25K elements and one for 2.5K elements).  

Offerors are encouraged to provide product literature that shows how their products meet the Government’s minimum specifications as set forth in the solicitation.  Such literature may be in the form of pamphlets or brochures, or a web site that sets forth enough detailed information for a determination to be made that the product meets the specifications.  Elaborate or excessive literature is not intended nor desired.  

--End of Amendment 0001--

All other terms of the original combined synopsis/solicitation posted on 27 July 2004 apply.

Unless otherwise advised by the COTR, this meeting will be held at USTDA’s office in Arlington, Virginia. The COTR shall provide the Contractor with names and addresses of the project sponsor(s), other pertinent entities to contact in the United States and overseas, and any other relevant details that may impact upon the design and/or evaluation of the proposed project(s).  

2.2		PRE-VISIT REPORT

Prior to departure to the host country, the Contractor shall provide the COTR a pre-visit written report of 3-5 pages containing the proposed schedule or itinerary, preliminary strategies or findings on project viability, financing options, U.S. company interest in the project, a list of contacts to be made during the visit and a pre-visit checklist of issues, information and questions to be utilized during the visit.  

2.3		USTDA RESPONSIBILITY

USTDA will advise the U.S. Embassy in the host country of the Contractor’s proposed travel itinerary prior to departure and request that the Commercial Section of the Embassy provide the Contractor with names and addresses of appropriate host country officials with whom to meet.

2.4		CONTRACTOR’S HOST COUNTRY TRAVEL 

The Contractor shall travel to the host country to meet with relevant project officials and with the U.S. Embassy.    The Contractor shall contact the Commercial Section at the U.S. Embassy upon arrival and prior to departure for briefing and debriefing meetings.   While the Embassy may be able to assist the Contractor in arranging some initial meetings with host country officials, the Contractor is responsible for arranging the meetings as well as logistics for the visit, i.e., hotel accommodations, transportation, and interpretation services. In some cases, the Contractor may need to Contract with a local entity to assist with these logistics.  Local entities may not provide the technical work of substance for the creation of the DM report. 

2.5		CONTRACTOR MEANINGFUL DISCUSSIONS

The Contractor shall hold meaningful discussions with appropriate contacts to determine and gauge the interest of potential project financiers and potential U.S. suppliers and assess whether the proposed project(s) is economically, financially, and technically viable.  The Contractor shall analyze the potential procurement of U.S. goods and services for project implementation by categories and dollar values.  The analysis shall include an assessment of the project risks and its financial viability, the priority of the project and political/social/organizational support it has, potential sources of financing, and the capability and experience of the project sponsor.  The analysis shall also include an assessment of the social and economic development impacts of the proposed project.

2.6		USTDA REPORT OBJECTIVES

If the Contractor recommends that USTDA fund the study (ies) in a phased approach, and/or if any outstanding issues should be resolved or conditions met before funding is approved, those phases, issues and/or conditions should be clearly explained in the recommendation.

2.6.2		The Contractor shall provide a final report to the USTDA, which will: 

2.6.2.1		assess and justify whether or not USTDA should provide funding for a feasibility study of the proposed project(s);

6 PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE
 
ESM, the Electric Power Company of Macedonia, is responsible for all power generation, transmission, and distribution in Macedonia.  ESM has 3 thermoelectric stations that have a combined capacity of 1,010 MW and are powered by lignite and oil.  The main thermal plant at Bitola supplies approximately 70 percent of Macedonia's electricity and is in good condition.  ESM also maintains and operates 14 hydropower stations; the four largest hydropower plants supply approximately 400 MW of electricity and the 10 small plants supply approximately 36 MW.  In 2002, ESM generated 5,618,7 GWh, of electricity, which fell short of the total demand of 6,646.6 GWh.   The remaining 1,027.9 GWh were imported to cover the demand. ESM currently has transmission lines connecting it to Greece, Serbia and Montenegro, and Bulgaria and will be constructing others to export and import electricity.  

In early 2001, the Government of Macedonia (GOM) decided to hire a consultant to coordinate the privatization of ESM, by designing a new company structure model and a detailed restructuring plan.  The GOM signed an agreement with an Austrian private investment and merchant bank, Meinl Bank AG from Vienna, to manage the restructuring and privatization of ESM.  Meinl Bank conducted the initial review of ESM in the spring of 2002.  

After experiencing several delays due to difficulties in Parliament to pass the necessary legislation for the restructuring to proceed, the GOM is proceeding with the restructuring of ESM.  The GOM has broken ESM into two separate entities.  The government will maintain the transmission assets of ESM and will therefore, be in charge of the transmission company.  The generation and distribution assets will remain as one company.  Meinl Bank AG will manage the actual tender process for the privatization, but according the GOM there are several other steps that must be done before it can proceed with the privatization.

ESM is seeking assistance from USTDA to help prepare for its upcoming privatization and to improve the efficiency of its resources so that it will continue to be profitable and meet European Union (EU) standards.  The following proposal(s) have been submitted by ESM for funding consideration. (Please note that the DM consultant will be responsible for reviewing other projects that may arise during the course of the visit.  The scope of work for this DM is not limited to these two projects, but these are two definitive proposals for which ESM has requested USTDA assistance.)
·	Upgrade and Modernization of Thermal Power Plant Negotino - TPP Negotino, near the city of Negotino, in the central part of the Republic of Macedonia, was built in the early 1980s and operates on very heavy/crude oil.  It is a major “cold reserve” of electricity power generation in Macedonia because it is only utilized during the peak season due to the high price of heavy oil worldwide in the past years.  ESM needs assistance in determining how to upgrade the plant, either by transferring its main fuel from heavy oil to high-caloric coals from imported sources, or upgrading Negotino into a combined-cycle natural gas-fired power plant.   
·	Centralized management system (CMS) for ESM – ESM would like assistance in developing a CMS.  This system would integrate ESM’s generation and distribution systems into one centralized management system.  Currently data is stored at each individual generation facility, but is not integrated or managed through a centralized data system.  [The GOM has obtained a loan from the World Bank, which will cover the financing of this project; however, this project is rather small.  Therefore, USTDA would like the DM consultant to examine this project and determine if there are larger feasibility studies that could include this project as a component.]
