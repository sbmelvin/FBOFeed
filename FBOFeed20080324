<DESC>The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Pittsburgh Research Laboratory (PRL) has conducted large-scale explosion experiments to evaluate the strength characteristics and air-leakage resistance of various mine ventilation control structures including seals.  Ventilation seals are used for safely isolating worked-out areas in underground coal mines.  The seal design evaluations are conducted within the multiple entry section of the PRL Lake Lynn Experimental Mine (LLEM) or within two test chambers located within the LLEM.  The large-scale underground chambers are used to conduct static loading tests either through the use of pressurized water (hydrostatic or hydraulic testing) or the confined ignition of flammable concentrations of methane.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has a requirement to deepen and widen the existing chamber to allow for the hydrostatic pressure loading evaluation of new seal designs.  As such, the work will consist of removing the existing chamber floor, deepening the chamber by about 20 ft, widening the chamber by about 5 ft, installing new plumbing into the chamber, installing a floor drain and drainage line, extending the existing fiber optic network to the hydrostatic chamber area, installation of two remote controlled cameras with associated video equipment, and installation of Voice Over IP phones.  The magnitude of the requirement, in terms of an estimated price range, is between $250,000 and $500,000.

This requirement is solicited on a full and open competition - unrestricted basis.

The CDC intends to award a single Construction / Firm-Fixed-Price contract.  The requirement is to be completed within 150 calendar days after the Government issues a Notice To Proceed.  

The complete solicitation document and reference material will be available for downloading at www.fedbizopps.gov on or about 10 APR 2008.  No verbal or written requests for copies will be accepted.

It is the responsibility of prospective offerors to stay abreast of additional postings regarding this solicitation at the FedBizOpps Internet site.

An organized site visit is scheduled for 24 APR 2008 at 10:00 am local time.  Offerors are urged and expected to inspect the site where the work will be performed at this time.  Participants will meet at Lake Lynn Laboratory, 2546 Springhill Furnace Road (Route 857), Lake Lynn, PA 15451.

<CONTACT>Ryan King, 202-267-7851
<DESC>HISTORY: Previous announcements regarding this program can be found on the FAA Contract Opportunities website (http://faaco.faa.gov/) by searching for "CSMC" in the search "By Keyword" field.  Be sure to check the "Include Archive" checkbox to view all announcements.  Be advised that these announcements are automatically posted to FedBizOpps, but it is strongly recommended to visit the FAA website stated above in order to view the original announcement (to ensure its accuracy and that of the associated attachments).  PURPOSE:   The purpose of this announcement is to notify industry of FAA's intent to hold a full and open competition for the CSMC requirement.  Subcontracting goals similar to that below will be included in the solicitation.  A solicitation has not yet been released; this is solely an informational announcement to assist vendors in preparing for the upcoming solicitation release expected in April 2008.   Subcontracting Plan: Offerors will be required to provide a detailed subcontracting plan that fulfills the requirements contained within FAA AMS clause 3.6.1-4 Small, Small Disadvantaged, Women-Owned and Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business Subcontracting Plan.  Full text of this clause can be found at http://conwrite.faa.gov/.  The offeror shall ensure their subcontracting plan fully addresses each of the eleven items listed in FAA AMS clause 3.6.1-4, inclusive of the respective percentages listed below as being required with an offeror's subcontracting plan. At least forty-five (45) percent of the planned subcontract dollar value shall be allocated to small businesses including: ýýý At least ten (10) percent of the total planned subcontract dollar value shall be allocated to small disadvantaged businesses ýýý At least five (5) percent of the total planned subcontract dollar value shall be allocated to small women-owned businesses ýýý At least three (3) percent of the total planned subcontract dollar value shall be allocated to service disabled veterans-owned businesses North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code: For purposes of determining a proposed subcontractor's eligibility as a small business the following NAICS Code shall apply: 541513 Computer Facilities Management Services (size standard - $23M) For those subcontractors that a contractor claims as a small business (for purposes of meeting the goals spelled out in their Subcontracting Plan) the proposed subcontractor must qualify as a small business under the NAICS code identified above.  The above-noted NAICS code represents the size standard for those types of services that account for the greatest percentage of total contract value; they stipulate that a business may not earn in excess of $23 million in average annual gross receipts over the past three years in order to qualify as a small business.   ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: This announcement is not intended to guarantee procurement of the services, and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract.  This is not a screening information request or request for proposal.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.  A procurement package is not available. The Government is not liable for cost associated with the preparation, submittal of inquiries or responses for this announcement and will not reimburse any firm for cost incurred in responding to this public announcement.  Updates to this announcement will be published on the FAA Contract Opportunities website (http://faaco.faa.gov/) under the Current Announcements for FAA Headquarters.   It is the vendor's responsibility to monitor this website for updates to this procurement.   END OF ANNOUNCEMENT

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of SafeNet Service/Maintenance. The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governmentýs requirements for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. IRM/OPS/MSO/EML has identified the SafeNet products as a key component of the departmentýs Remote Access server farm. The above listed equipment and software is currently deployed throughout the network and laptop environment with over 1000+ DoS clients tied into the system. SafeNet allows access to the Department of State when accessing the servers from remote locations. The 41 USC 253(c) (1) and FAR 6.302-1 are cited as the statutory authority. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor unique qualifications are used as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the departmentýs requirements as a key component of the departmentýs Remote Access networking infrastructure. The Remote access network infrastructure is a SafeNet environment and any deviations to the SafeNet model would pose technical anomalies that could potentially interrupt the availability of the remote servers to the Department of State employees. The goal of the department is to form a cohesive network infrastructure where resources will be better and more easily remotely accessed.<BR><BR>POP:  May 1, 2008 through April 30, 2009.<BR><BR>

<DESC>The scope of this contract is to provide Aerial Services in support of work for the 2008 High Lakes Stabilization Project.  The Contractor shall utilize commercial aircraft, as well as industry standard packaging, loading and unloading practices and techniques, to deliver (fly-in and fly-out) approximately 225,000 lbs of Government Furnished and/or Leased Property (i.e. earth moving equipment, fuel and miscellaneous project equipment and supplies).  Depending on load efficiencies the Government has estimated that delivery will require 32 fly-in trips and 29 fly-out trips.  Loads will weigh up to 8,000 lbs. Deliveries will be made from a Government designated non-wilderness staging area on a dam at Moon Lake, UT (elevation 8,000 to 9,000-ft) to Government designated landing areas (10,000 to 10,500 feet in elevation) at two mountain lakes in the Brown Duck Basin of the High Uintas Wilderness Area (HUWA).   
These lakes, Brown Duck Lake and Island Lake, range from approximately 5 to 5.5 air miles from the staging area.  During the estimated fly-in period (last two weeks of June) ambient air temperature at the staging area usually ranges between approximately 55 degrees and 85 degrees Fahrenheit during daylight hours.  The temperature at the landing areas are likely to be between 5-15 degrees Fahrenheit cooler than at the staging area.
It is anticipated that aerial services will be needed for 1-2 days for load delivery fly-in to landing areas and 1-2 days for load fly-out to the staging area.
Under this contract, fly-in deliveries shall be made by the Contractor within the specified timeframe (Base Bid) of June 16th to June 22nd, 2008, unless the Government has determined that on-site conditions are not viable for placement of Government Furnished and or Leased Property at the landing areas. If a non-viable determination is made the Government will choose whether or not to exercise Option 1 and deliveries will be made between June 23rd and June 30th, 2008.   
Load fly-out shall occur anytime after September 21st, 2008 but shall occur prior to the onset of winter weather that could preclude delivery services from the landing areas to the staging area.   
This Project will be uploaded into FedBizopps on approximately 3/26/2008. 
Proposals and pricing are due close of business 4/24/08

<DESC>NUMBERED NOTE 1 IS APPLICABLE - THE PROPOSED CONTRACT IS 100% SET ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS. SOLICITATION WILL POST ON OR ABOUT 24 MARCH 2008.
Hydraulic Pad Forming Press, heavy duty 4-post with down-acting ram.  The press should be designed for even loading.  The forming capacity shall be at least 620 tons (approx. 950 psi) and have 10 tons of retraction capacity.  The overall size should be approximately 6 foot wide and 4foot deep.  The height cannot exceed 12 feet and should include a top mounted reservoir and pump.  The press should be capable of forming up to 1000 cubic inches of material.  The expected use of this press is to form 2024 O condition aluminum up to .090 inch thickness.  Parts will be manually fed from the front.  The ram should reverse on pressure with a dwell capacity of 15 seconds with + or - 5% force fluctuation.

Platen:  The steel platen should be 36 inches by 36 inches with a thickness of 3 inches.  The platen should not have any mounting holes on the working surface and should be welded or firmly bolted to the bed.  The press box shall have multiple urethane pads with a total thickness of 8 inches.  The bed should sit approximately 36 inches above the floor.

Press Box:  The press box should have a Guerin box design, where the pad box will enclose around the outside of the bed bolster.  The press box should be bolted to the bottom of the ram.  

Stroke & Daylight:  The stroke and daylight need to be 12 inches to allow for material positioning.  The stroke should be adjustable from 0 inches to 12 inches to reduce the cycle time when a smaller stroke is sufficient.

Shut Height:  0 inches +/- 1/4 inches

Power requirements:  The power available for this equipment is 460 V, 3 phase.

Approximate Ram speeds:  Fast approach 50 IPM, Pressing 10 IPM, Return 60 IPM

<DESC>The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) anticipates award of an Indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC) to provide anticorruption services for the Office of Democracy and Governance in the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA).   The purpose of this contract is to provide USAID and its partner countries with the broad range of technical assistance necessary to develop and implement appropriate and meaningful strategies to fight corruption and ensure accountability in public life.  USAID defines corruption as the abuse of entrusted authority for private gain.  This activity focuses on unilateral abuses by governmental officials such as embezzlement and nepotism, as well as abuses linking public and private actors such as bribery, extortion, influence peddling, and fraud, and at both lower and higher levels of government and the public sector (i.e., both administrative and grand corruption).  The activities to support the strategic approaches to fighting corruption under this contract are expected to encompass the following functional areas: (a) public financial, administrative and regulatory measures that promote transparency and accountability; (b) civil society advocacy on behalf of governmental integrity; and (c) incorporation of anti-corruption promotion into other sectoral/sub-sectoral areas, such as health and education, corporate governance, or into key aspects of democracy promotion, such as rule of law, legislative oversight or local government strengthening.  In addition, the Contractor shall award and administer, upon task order request, a small grants program to support indigenous nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in pilot or experimental activities as well as provide institutional strengthening support, as appropriate, to the recipient NGOs.  USAID estimates awarding five (5) contracts as a result of this solicitation, including 4 unrestricted and one small business set-aside.  USAID anticipates that the maximum ordering limitation of the contracts resulting from this RFP will be $750,000,000 over the five (5) year ordering period.  Note that this ceiling applies across all contracts and cannot be exceeded in the aggregate; each successful contractor will be eligible to compete on all task orders until the shared ceiling for all contracts is reached.  There is no guarantee on the number of contracts awarded, the number of task orders that any one firm will receive, or the amount of money each firm is entitled to beyond the minimum monetary amount stated in the RFP. The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541990.  The solicitation will be posted on the FEDBIZOPPS web page (i.e., www.fedbizopps.gov) not less than fifteen (15) days after this notice is issued.     In accordance with FAR 5.102(d), availability of the solicitation is limited to this electronic medium only. Requests for other copies of the solicitation will be disregarded without notice to the requestor.  No phone requests will be accepted, no solicitation will be available for pick-up, and no walk-ins will be allowed.  Questions must be directed to Ms. Ryan Johnson, Contracting Officer, U.S. Agency for International Development, M/OAA/DCHA/DOFDA, Ronald Reagan Building, Room 7.09-146, 1300 Pennsylvania Ave, NW Washington, D.C. 20523, (Phone: 202-712-1185) (Fax: 202-216-3132) (email: ryjohnson@usaid.gov).

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) is about to solicit proposals from all interested organizations for a study entitled: CHEARS (Children Ebstein's Anomaly Research Study).  Specifically, a contractor will be selected to assist in the recruitment of approximately 900 families over a three year period from communities in Ukraine. Children with Ebstein's anomaly/tricuspid valve disease (referred to as case) will be recruited to the study, as will their parents. Controls will be recruited from the same neighborhoods as the cases (children with Ebstein's anomaly) and will also include the parents. Controls will be matched by age, sex and region of origin to cases in a ratio of two (2) controls for each case. If neither parent is available, at least one other blood relative will be recruited in place of the parents. The more general diagnosis of tricuspid valve disease is to be included in the selection of participants, since often those with mild forms of Ebstein's are not appropriately diagnosed. The subjects will be interviewed by a physician, and medically evaluated by Doppler echocardiography.  Blood, cheek and saliva tissue samples will be collected to obtain DNA for a genome wide association analysis. Usually each family will only need to be seen once. A goal of CHEARS, although not a requirement to be performed or funded as part of this acquisition, is the identification of the genetic basis for Ebstein's anomaly, a birth defect involving malformation of the tricuspid valve of the heart.  Such findings may yield insight into disease mechanisms that may provide novel diagnostic tools as well as therapeutic strategies for medical remediation of this often life threatening and debilitating congenital heart disease. (The analyses associated with the collection of samples will take place at the NHLBI.)   

The Government anticipates that one contract will be awarded for a three-year duration. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541712. The Request for Proposals, numbered RFP-NHLBI-HL-08-20, will be available on or about April 8, 2008 on the FedBizOpps Web site at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  See the Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Rockledge Drive Bethesda postings. Proposals will be due on or about May 22, 2008. Prospective offerors are responsible for downloading the RFP and all attachments. Offerors are responsible for monitoring the FedBizOpps Web site for the release of the solicitation and any amendments.

<DESC>Introduction

The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases(NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases. The NIAID, Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, has a requirement to support genomic sequencing activities, which include high throughput sequencing, comparative genomic sequencing and genotyping.

Description 

This contract provides for the continuation of the Microbial Genome Sequencing Centers program. The current contracts are due to expire on February 28, 2009. Through this contract, up to two large-scale Genomic Sequencing Centers for Infectious Diseases (hereinafter also referred to as ''Centers'') will be established that support a diverse set of genome sequencing activities. For purposes of this contract, genomic sequencing activities include high throughput sequencing, comparative genomic sequencing and genotyping. High throughput sequencing capacity is defined as the capability to produce high quality sequencing data in a highly efficient manner with continuous increase in efficiency and decrease in costs; generate a diverse variety of genome sequence products; develop and implement new technologies; and maintain an automated production pipeline with a throughput of 20 million successful sequence reads per year. Comparative genomics and genotyping are defined as using high throughput platforms to examine the whole genome for genetic variation. 

Genomes that will be sequenced through these Centers include microorganisms considered agents of bioterrorism (NIAID Category A-C priority pathogens http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/topics/BiodefenseRelated/Biodefense/default.htm), clinical isolates, closely related species and strains, invertebrate vectors of diseases, and microorganisms responsible for emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/research/topics/emerging/list.htm).  

Emphasis will be placed on sequencing multiple strains and isolates of specific microbial species and communities than on sequencing individual microorganisms.

Proposals will be evaluated based on the following technical evaluation criteria: 

1) adequacy, appropriateness, and feasibility of the scientific and technical approaches to providing proposed sequencing and genotyping activities; 2) adequacy, appropriateness, and feasibility of plans to provide genomic sequencing and genotyping services and resources to the scientific community; 3) appropriateness and relevance of the documented training, education, experience, expertise and availability of proposed scientific and technical personnel in relation to their specific duties and responsibilities; 4) adequacy, appropriateness and availability of facilities and other resources including equipment, computation facilities, and software tools; 5) adequacy and appropriateness of plans for compliance with all safety guidelines and regulations; and 6) adequacy, appropriateness, and feasibility of proposed organizational and staffing plans, communications, project management and database management. 

It is anticipated that multiple cost reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded for a 5-year period of performance beginning on or about February 6, 2009. It is estimated that the provision of FTEs will be approximately 29.9.

Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency. This RFP will be available electronically on/about March 5, 2008, and may be accessed through FedBizOpps (http://www.fedbizopps.gov/). This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. See Government-Wide Numbered Note 26.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 561920   NAICS Code: 561920 The Office of Air Programs Stratospheric Protection Division of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Rules (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, intends to issue a sole source purchase  order to Agricultural Research Consulting for support for the 2008 Methyl Bromide Alternatives Outreach (MBAO) conference, to be held November 11 thru November 14, 2008.  The support will include conference planning, conference organization and implementation, and distribution of conference  proceedings. The annual Methyl Bromide Alternatives Outreach (MBAO) conference is the only worldwide conference focused on sharing research and field trial experience relating to methyl bromide alternatives.  The MBAO conference has been in effect since 1994 and continues to serve as a useful  platform for sharing information, as the January 1, 2005 phaseout of methyl bromide has taken effect.  The period of performance will be from date of award until November 30, 2008.   Only Agricultural Research Consulting is able to organize and host a conference on alternatives to methyl bromide  in a timely, inexpensive, and effective manner that avoids a significant waste of government resources and insures government objectives will be successfully accomplished.  First, obtaining conference services from a different source would require organizing a completely new conference from its  initial stages. Second, EPA's contribution is joined by that of USDA and other entities. Were EPA to organize and host a conference on its own, the cost of doing so would be greater than the amount EPA contributes to the organization of the MBAO conference.  Third, any new conference would not have  the reputation or institutional history of the MBAO conference and would not attract the same caliber of presenters or the same diversity of attendees.   NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE IS AVAILABLE.  Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting this requirement may submit  a response, which if received within two days of the closing date of this announcement, will be considered.  Responses to this announcement must be in writing to the Contracting Specialist at daniels.ryan@epa.gov.

BELO HORIZONTE INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM PROJECT.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for an Integrated Traffic Information Management System( ITIMS) for Belo Horizonte's Traffic and Transportation Company (Empresa de Transportes e Transito de Belo Horizonte SA, BHTRANS). 

The feasibility study would review the application of an ITIMS for the integration of all traffic management operations within the city.  BHTRANS is looking to integrate all of the information generated by its various departments and operations in one central database that would include a GIS based system.  

The ITIMS envisioned by BHTRANS would include the automation of all field operations handled by the field operations and emergency teams by way of hand-held computers to register the field information and quickly transfer that information by wireless communications to the intelligent traffic control system center.  Once all the field information is received in the central control, then the information would be available for use within the entire BHTRANS organization allowing users to benefit from the most up to date traffic information.  Traffic information could then be displayed and posted on a web site for the benefit of the public.  BHTRANS would like to explore the potential of marketing and selling the available traffic information to the public, similar to what is done by some private companies in the U.S.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $294,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to: https://www.ustda.gov/USTDA/FedBizOpps/RFP/rfpform.asp  

Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm?s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English and Portuguese directly to the Grantee by 1:00pm (local time), April 21, 2008 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to award a contract for One hundred samples to be analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase PCR) and quantitative cell culture during the pilot phase of the study with an option to analyze an additional 900 samples should the initial analyses be acceptable to The Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion (DHQP) Investigators.  Outbreaks of influenza in healthcare facilities have occurred during influenza seasons; the pandemic has the potential to amplify transmission several fold. In order to maintain a functional healthcare system during a pandemic, both patients and healthcare workers must be protected.  The experience from SARS outbreaks highlighted the importance of clear and accurate infection control recommendations in order to protect patients and healthcare personnel.  Currently, the precision of recommendations is limited by a lack of studies demonstrating specific distances over which respiratory pathogens such as influenza remain infective.  The Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion (DHQP) has initiated a study to investigate airborne infectivity of influenza over time and distance (airborne suvivability) and environmental persistence on surfaces.  DHQP has a requirement for PCR analysis and quantitative cell culture analysis for influenza of air and surface samples in support of the airborne infectivity and environmental persistence projects. The environmental samples need to be analyzed by DNA methods (i.e., polymerase chain reaction, PCR) to determine the total amount of virus (both infective and non-infective) in each sample and analyzed by quantitative cell culture to determine the total amount of infective (i.e. live) virus in each sample.  The complete solicitation package will be available and posted at this site for downloading when issued. No telephone requests of the solicitation will be accepted or entertained. No questions will be questions will be answered via telephone.  No hard copy of the solicitation package will be mailed. All responsible sources may submit a proposal for consideration.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION: 
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with Coherent Laser Group, of Santa Clara, California, for the acquisition of a Chameleon Ultra II Ti:S Laser System to be used in the Surface and Microanalysis Science Division of the Chemical Science and Technology Laboratory at NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland. 

*** NIST cites FAR 6.302-1(a)(ii)(A) and (B) (see excerpt below) as primary rationale for Sole Source Determination.
(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in --
(A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or
(B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency?s requirements. (See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (d)(1)(B).)

This requirement is for the development of a video rate, multi photon fluorescence microscope in support of NIST?s Enviornmental Health and Safety for Nanotechnology program.  

Sole source determination is based on the fact that, in order to increase the stability and usable spectral coverage of a multiphoton optical microscope, NIST requires a matched laser source that is a direct 1:1 replacement (in terms of compatibility and electronic interconnect requirements) for the existing Ti:S laser system in its lab (NIST property # 628463).  Coherent Laser?s Chameleon Ultra II Ti:S laser system with pulse compression control is a direct upgrade (in terms of stability and increased spectral coverage) of NIST?s existing Ti:S laser system.

Further, to achieve the necessary, high fidelity spectral coverage across a broad bandwidth (680-1080 nm) and to take full advantage of the pre-existing wavelength optimization servos and automated tuning schemes, matched Ti:S oscillators are required.  

Coherent Laser Group is the only known vendor capable of supplying the required Ti:S Laser System.

***Delivery shall be FOB DESTINATION and be completed in accordance with the Contractor?s commercial schedule. ***

*** As defined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation, (FAR), FOB Destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.  The contractor shall deliver all line items to NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland, 20899-0001. ***

*****The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334413, and the size standard is 500 Employees.

******A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

*****No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, responses received by April 8, 2008 will be considered by the Government.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>This is the synopsis and public notice for acquisitions over $25,000. 

The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Aircraft Operations Center (AOC), located at MacDill AFB, FL intends to issue a firm-fixed price commercial items contract for (1) the acquisition and installation of a Wulfsberg Flexcomm II system and (2) the acquisition and installation of a new audio control and intercommunication system in a DHC-6 Twin Otter aircraft. It is intended that a contract award will be issued by July 15, 2008.

The proposed acquisition is for supply and services for which the Government is seeking contractors who can provide both the following: (1) acquisition and installation of a Wulfsberg Flexcomm II system and (2) acquisition and installation of new Northern Airborne Technology audio control and intercommunication system (ICS) panels in the same aircraft. It is not in the Government's best interest to procure these items separately. Only the Wulfsburg system is considered acceptable. It is the only manufacturer of aviation radios having the range of frequencies and capabilities needed for NOAA's Twin Otter operations. The Wulfsberg radio allows pilots to communicate on UHF and VHF frequencies, including marine band VHF. This unit and the Northern Airborne Technology ICS are required to match the systems currently installed in NOAA's other Twin Otter aircraft. NOAA requires the avionics in the Twin Otters be the same to maintain consistency in the fleet. Actual schedule start and completion dates for each task will be negotiated between the Government and the contractor. 

Firms must be either a Federal Aviation Administration Repair Station or Canadian Approved Maintenance Organization Center and carry the appropriate hull insurance of not less than $2,500,000 to cover the aircraft. Interested firms shall include, in writing, company name, address, point of contact, telephone number, and business size; a statement regarding their capabilities and qualifications to perform this work on Twin Otter aircraft and other services. Responses can be faxed to Ron Anielak at (816) 274-6951 or sent via email to ronald.f.anielak@noaa.gov. All responsible business sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency. 

DOC, CRAD requires that all contractors doing business with this office be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR). No award can be made to a company not registered in CCR. For additional information and to register in CCR, please access the following web site: http://www.ccr.gov. In order to register, all offerors must have a Dunn & Bradstreet Number.

Various Increments Solicited.  See numbered notes 12 and 26.

The hardware solution above was analyzed and tested for interoperability against other solution sets with existing Department of State enterprise hardware and proved to be both the best technical solution and value. All testing was based on predetermined Department requirements. Wholesale changes in equipment type will result in large risks to the Department due to lengthy retesting, configuration, and design. The department will also not realize a Return on investment in this product which will lead to a non standardized environment for a solution that requires cross platform consistency. Additionally, Changes in design will place unnecessary risk to the Department in the deployment of disaster recovery sets due to the lengthy process of placing new equipment on the ITCCB approved equipment list for enterprise use.<BR><BR>IRM/OPS/PMA has identified the equipment listed in paragraph two (2) as the only suitable candidate available in the market today meeting Department's requirements regarding cost, capacity, performance, scalability, packaging and durability as well as ease of use in the backup model described in (2) above.  Furthermore, the equipment is listed on the IRM ITCCB approved hardware list.  Use of third party equipment which has not been tested by the Department for compatibility with existing hardware and software will place the Department at risk and will cause unacceptable delays to the Programs schedule in support of the unclassified and classified IT refresh efforts.  Additionally, storage arrays use vendor specific operating systems.  Changing to another product of similar hardware specifications will put the Department at risk due to documentation, integration, configuration, and installation process change requirements. GITM Procurement requires the brand name equipment listed above in (2) to be procured on a brand name only basis.  Brand name only acquisition is permitted when justified as essential to meeting the Government Requirements by FAR 11.105. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractorýs unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departmentýs requirements as a key component of the Departmentýs networking system. Although the requirement is restricted to brand name only, AQM will post the requirement on FedBid and will included the brand name justification with the posting.  The requirement will be competed on FedBid amongst Federal Supply Schedule Holders in compliance with FAR 8.405-6.     The requirement will be set-aside for GSA schedule holders only.  GSA has already determined the prices to be fair and reasonable.  The Government will award a delivery order to the offer that represents the overall the best value.   After extensive testing of nine storage solutions (FilesX Xpress Restore Repository Testing Results version 1.0, December 14, 2006), the JetStor 412/416 storage arrays were the only arrays found to be compatible with the Departments existing hardware and software.<BR><BR>

<DESC>1. CONTRACT INFORMATION

The 496th Air Base Squadron/Contracting Office will issue Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contracts for Architect and Engineering (A/E) services at Moron Air Base, Spain. A total of two (2) IDIQ contracts will be issued as a result of this advertisement. The performance period for each contract shall be five (5) years; one (1) base year plus four (4) option years. This requirement is unrestricted for all firms; NAICS is 541310; size standard $4.5 million or less in average annual gross receipts. 

The maximum total contract fees shall not exceed $300,000 per year, or $1,500,000 total for five years; the maximum fees for each task order shall not exceed $250,000. The minimum guaranteed amount is $2,500 per IDIQ contract, and will be issued on the first task order. All work shall be issued by means of negotiated and competed firm fixed-price task orders. 

The first two ranked firms as decided by the selection board will be required to submit firm fixed-prices on wages and disciplines.  Negotiations for the eventual contracts will be held with the first two ranked firms and follow the procedures set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation, Part 36, as supplemented.
   
Each task order will be competed between the two firms for fair opportunity to be considered.  Awardees need not respond to every requirement for a task order requirement.  Excluding the initial task order, each Request for Proposals will be non-mandatory proposals.  Firms will be required to submit a No Bid response if they are unable to perform a requirement, which must include a brief statement as to the reasons why they chose not to respond.

In an effort to eliminate conflict of interest issues, the Government will award either IDIQ contract to a prime contractor and their first level subcontractor and/or team members, but not both. For example, a prime contractor, first level subcontractor and/or team members who were selected for one A/E contract will not be considered for the second A/E contract. The separation of contracts is intended to mitigate conflict of interest issues with competing A/E firms.

<DESC>Amendment 0002 A ? UNIVERSITY AND NON-PROFIT SCIENTIFIC AND                ENGINEERING RESEARCH   AMENDMENT TO ANNOUNCEMENT N00178-08-Q-3004 - Open through 9/30/08 The purpose of this amendment is to add a topic: 1.  The following topics are hereby added to the announcement: Topic (n) - A portion of the NSWCDD workload involves applied engineering, analysis, and/or design of weapons, weapons systems, weapons platforms and targets.  This requires the use of advance analysis tools, especially hydrocodes.  To accurately predict material response under extreme loadings, state-of-the-art material strength models are needed for hydrocodes.  Of particular concern is the behavior of metals, concrete, composites and ceramic materials.  For brittle materials, statistical fracture is an important consideration.  For ductile materials, shear banding, anisotropic yield surfaces and material stability/bifurcation are key concerns that need to be adequately accounted for.  These capabilities are needed in DOE hydrocodes used by DoD that include Presto, CTH and ALE3D. 2.  This announcement will remain open and white papers will be accepted through 30 September 2008.?

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE (SSN) ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL, QUOTATION OR INVITATION TO BID NOTICE AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT.
The Government is currently conducting market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation, Part 10 to identify potential sources to provide the requirement and gather information on current capabilities within the market. All information submitted in response to this SSN is voluntary and the Government will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the Government. Proprietary information submitted should be marked appropriately and will be controlled and secured. All submitted information shall remain with the U.S. Government and will not be returned.
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) anticipates pursuing the acquisition of information technology services for the analysis and potentially the implementation of a system for the preparation and submission of complex (multi-project) electronic grant applications. Titles of subsets include those submitted for grants under the P01 Research Program Project Grant, P30 Center Core Grants, and U54 Interdisciplinary Research Consortium. These types of grant applications include multiple projects within a single application submission.  Each subproject includes information at the level of detail of a full grant application, including individual budgets that may roll up to multiple levels of summary budget, as well as a single overall budget.
Characteristics of the proposed grant application system:
?	Provides ease of use for both applicants and agency staff posting funding opportunities
?	Stores ?work in progress? applications.  Also provides for the applicant to download and store copies of both in-progress and completed applications, to allow for reuse of previously entered application data.
?	Submits completed applications as XML documents to Grants.gov via the Grants.gov System to System web service interface.
?	Support application data set sizes of up to 4GB of XML including documents of varying formats embedded in the XML dataset including but not limited to embedded PDF, Image (e.g. JPEG, TIFF, PNG), and XML documents.
?	Supports authentication of users submitting applications against existing Grants.gov account information.
?	Initially supports a few hundred concurrent users geographically distributed with the future ability to scale to up to 500,000 concurrent users with no perceptible reduction in system performance.
?	Supports geographically distributed users working on the same application concurrently.
?	Supports broad operating system compatibility including compatibility with standards-based web browsers. Such compatibility should include all major operating systems used by the scientific community including Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac OS X, Linux and Unix derivatives.  The system should also support the web browsers commonly associated with these operating systems, including but not limited to Internet Explorer, Firefox, Netscape Navigator/Mozilla, Safari and Opera.
?	Stores data in formats that allow authorized end-users to define the data elements to be collected and to manage the content of the user interfaces, without the need for new software development.
?	Provides a clear distinction between the software that manages the application data and process, and the software that presents and collects the data from the applicant. 
?	Provides for the evolution of user interface technologies with minimal change to the data management and storage functionality.
?	Supports the dynamic definition and application of data business rules without the need for new software development and may support the extraction of such business rules from Grants.gov, NIH or other agency business rule repositories via Web Services.
?	Support business rules associated with budgets that provide for summation of budgets across multiple dimensions and the ability to constrain each budget dimension independently based on dynamically defined budget allocation.
?	Supports multiple tiers of budget within sub-applications
?	Supports multiple tiers of budgets summarizing the sub-application budgets
?	Supports extraction and population of key data in the application from NIH, other agency or grantee institution records accessed via Web Services.
?	Supports authentication of system users against NIH, other agency or grantee institution account information accessed via Web Services as well as supporting users who may not be registered with external authorities.
?	Meets the requirements of 29 U.S.C. 749d, Section 508.
?	Stores protected personal, proprietary and other sensitive information securely in accordance with federal law and regulation including but not limited to 44 U.S.C. 3451 (FISMA), 5 U.S.C. 552a (The Privacy Act) and 44 U.S.C. 201 (HIPAA) where these are relevant.
?	Where appropriate, makes use of existing Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) or Government Off the Shelf (GOTS) products ? including products developed and/or currently deployed for respondent?s customers.
?	Where appropriate, utilizes open source products.
The Government will evaluate responses based on the following scoring methodology:  technical capability and experience.  Respondents without demonstrated automated systems experience with Grants.gov or a similar system will not be considered.    This is a data gathering, fact finding effort.  The goal is to  identify the potential offerors most likely to offer the best solution.  Those offerors will be selected to participate in a formal acquisition. 
All responses must be submitted via e-mail to Em?Ria J. Briscoe at briscoee@mail.nih.gov on April 4, 2008 by 1:00 p.m.  Faxed proposals will not be accepted.  Inquiries regarding this procurement may be sent to Em?Ria J. Briscoe at briscoee@mail.nih.gov.

<DESC>NAICS Code:  511210 and the Small Business Size Standard is $23 million.  The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Fig Leaf Software Incorporated, 1523 16th Street, Washington, DC 20036 for CommonSpot Software and their commercially available, proprietary customizations.  This software will support the automation of Web Content Management for EPA?s Office of Water (OW) including automated Web navigational components, a user-friendly Web interface supporting the publication and maintenance of content by non-technical users, automated content approval workflows, and automatic application of metadata to Web pages and page assets. The U.S. EPA believes that Fig Leaf Software is the only source capable of providing this software plus the customizations specifically suited for the Federal government?s information architecture (IA).  These customizations include IA based navigation modules, custom metadata based on EPA taxonomy, custom content editing modules, custom external hyperlink management and metadata attribute modules, and custom code to include related links based on EPA taxonomy and OW IA.  All interested parties who believe they can provide the required software and the required customizations should fully explain their capabilities and qualifications in writing within 15 days from the date of this announcement.   The intent of this synopsis is to determine if any other sources may exist and, therefore, no Request for Quote (RFQ) is available.  Consequently, any response(s) failing to provide the aforementioned data but instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will not be honored.  If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days of this notice to determine whether another source exists, a contract will be placed with Fig Leaf Software Incorporated.  Submit your response to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, RTP Procurement Operations Division (E105-02), Attn:  Dan Neustedter, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711 or e-mail Neustedter.Dan@epa.gov.

<DESC>Concerns having the ability to furnish the services described herein are required to give written notification (including telephone number for a point of contact) to the procurement office above within 10 days from the date of this synopsis.  The U.S. Geological Survey, GD-ESP Team, Denver, CO has a requirement for accurate luminescence dates on fine-grained eolian sediments by green-light stimulated luminescence for base year and two option years.  Luminescence analysis shall include field and laboratory measurements of U, Th, K concentrations in the host sediment; calculation of dose rate; laboratory estimates of soil moisture; laboratory analysis of green light simulated luminescence on quartz separates from samples; and calculation of ages using data obtained in listed items above.  The deposits require OSL analysis by the same green luminescence method used successfully in earlier studies to determine the ages of the deposits.  Based on information available at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1), implemented by FAR 5.30201, the Government considers the services specified as a sole source from the University of Illinois-Chicago Luminescence Laboratory, Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Chicago, IL, and proposes to negotiate a purchase order with this firm on that basis.

<DESC>Introduction:  Market research is being conducted as part of the preliminary planning phase (prior to formal public announcement) in accordance with OMB Circular A 76 and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10. The purpose of the market research is to validate the scope and grouping of functions, determine the appropriate North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes, and confirm whether potential sources are available to satisfy agency requirements allowing standard public-private competition.  Small business sources will be considered in this research.  A contract may or may not result depending on the outcome of the market research and any subsequent public-private competition.  

The purpose of conducting a public-private competition is to determine the most efficient and cost effective method for providing the services required. If conducted, a public-private competition will determine whether the services will be performed under contract from commercial sources or continue to be provided by a Most Efficient Organization (MEO) of the federal workforce.  The Government contemplates the issuance of a solicitation for all or part of the service requirements defined below. 

NOTE:  This is to advise any commercial source that provides information as part of this market research process that any information provided will be protected.  This information is being collected solely to assist the government in making the determination whether or not to proceed to competition, and if so, how the functions in question would be grouped for solicitation.  Information obtained will not be used later as part of the evaluation process should they choose to submit a proposal to any solicitation that may result.  This participation is voluntary and the Government will not reimburse any company who responds to the questionnaire.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE. NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. BASED ON CAPABILITY STATEMENTS RECEIVED IN RESPONSE TO THIS SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT THIS ACQUISITION MAY BE SOLICITED AS A 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.  ALL SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS (SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, VOSB, and SDVOSB) ARE ENCOURAGED TO RESPOND TO THIS NOTICE.  SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS MUST HAVE THEIR SIZE STATUS CERTIFIED BY THE SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION.  ALL SMALL BUSINESSES ARE ENCOURAGED TO RESPOND. THE NAICS CODE IS 541711 WITH A SIZE STANDARD OF 500.

This acquisition provides for the continuation of the Microbial Genome Sequencing Centers program. The current contracts (N01-AI-30071 with the J. Craig Venter Institute and HHSN266200400001C with Massachusetts Institute of Technology) are due to expire on October 30, 2008. Through this acquisition, up to two large-scale Genomic Sequencing Centers for Infectious Diseases (hereinafter also referred to as "Centers") will be established that support a diverse set of genome sequencing activities.  For purposes of this acquisition, genomic sequencing activities include high throughput sequencing, comparative genomic sequencing and genotyping.  High throughput sequencing capacity is defined as the capability to produce high quality sequencing data in a highly efficient manner with continuous increase in efficiency and decrease in costs; generate a diverse variety of genome sequence products; develop and implement new technologies; and maintain an automated production pipeline with a throughput of 20 million successful sequence reads per year. Comparative genomics and genotyping are defined as using high throughput platforms to examine the whole genome for genetic variation. 

Genomes that will be sequenced through these Centers include microorganisms considered agents of bioterrorism (NIAID Category A-C priority pathogens http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/topics/BiodefenseRelated/Biodefense/default.htm), clinical isolates, closely related species and strains, invertebrate vectors of diseases, and microorganisms responsible for emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/research/topics/emerging/list.htm).  Emphasis will be placed on sequencing multiple strains and isolates of specific microbial species and communities than on sequencing individual microorganisms.

Centers will provide rapid and cost-efficient sequencing of microbial and invertebrate vector genomic DNA in an industrial production sequencing environment. Genome sequences will be generated from well characterized microbial strains and clinical isolates.  Centers will examine genetic variation and perform genotyping in populations and communities of human pathogens and also across the human genome with the goal of identifying genetic associations with observable phenotypes in the pathogen and in the human host.  These include, for example, microbial genetic correlates of disease emergence, virulence, and transmissibility, and host genetic variation that are associated with susceptibility to infection, disease severity, progression and outcome, responses to vaccination, and therapeutics.

It is essential that source code versions of any such software be available. CHED is the only product that is even remotely applicable for which source code is available. In addition, it is essential that the source code be available to ensure that NIST products related to the use of CHED can be used in the future.

SERVICES:  Human Resources (HR) Recruitment -- Sourcing and Placement of DARPA Program Managers (PMs)


TERMS AND CONDITIONS
This is a Request for Information, a market survey for written information only.  This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals, and no contract will be awarded from this Notice.  This Notice does not restrict the Government regarding the ultimate acquisition approach that may be taken in the future.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this Notice or any follow-up information requests.  No telephone calls will be accepted requesting a bid package or solicitation.  There is no bid package or solicitation.  To protect the procurement integrity of any future procurement, if any, that may arise from this Notice, information regarding the technical point of contact will not be given and no appointments for presentations will be made.
1.	The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is seeking sources to identify qualified individuals for consideration as technical program managers (PMs).  The objective is to provide DARPA with resumes of individuals with the requisite creative skills, and technical and programmatic experience in DARPA-identified science and technology areas.  

2.	DARPA is the central research and development (R&D) organization for the Department of Defense (DoD).  The Agency manages and directs selected basic and applied R&D projects for DoD and pursues research and technology where both risk and payoff are very high and success may provide dramatic capability advances for military roles and missions.

3.	There are approximately 140 PMs at DARPA, who are hired as U.S. Government employees for term positions of 4 - 6 years, resulting in an annual personnel turnover rate of approximately 25 percent.  The PMs are hired based on their ability to develop ideas for innovative technical capabilities that are important to DoD.  DARPA has a robust personnel recruitment program, but believes there may be qualified individuals who are not aware of DARPA's unique employment opportunities.  
 
4.	The use of a recruitment firm is to determine whether there are PM candidates about which DARPA is unaware.  The firm would identify talent that meets DARPA standards for creativity, entrepreneurship, and experience.  Sources may learn more about the Agency, its mission, and the desired traits of a prospective PM by referencing DARPA's Strategic Plan at http://www.darpa.mil/body/ mission.html and the Human Resources Directorate (HRD) website at http://www.darpa.mil/hrd.   

5.	DARPA seeks sources for one base period of 3 months, with one additional 9-month option period, and two subsequent 12-month option periods, resulting in a potential contract performance time maximum up to 3 years.  The services to be provided will include:  
 - 	Identification and collection of resumes for both active job seekers and passive prospects for consideration as DARPA PMs
 - 	Review and assessment of resumes to evaluate technical abilities, work experience, education, and personal presentation to serve as DARPA PMs
 - 	Verification of resume content, such as stated career and educational background, degrees and certifications, statements of professional accomplishments, and references
 - 	Verification that the candidates are U.S. citizens and eligible to obtain a SECRET clearance.  
 - 	Verification the candidates would be willing to locate in Arlington, Virginia
 - 	Prioritization and selection of resumes for submission to DARPA for consideration as PMs.

<SUBJECT>A -- Intent to Sole Source
<DESC>Fifteen days after publication of this notice, the Strategic Technology Office (STO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) intends to issue a request for proposal to Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC).

Using traffic generators in addition to existing production traffic, the Government will be able to continue to test and report on the following characteristics of the Control Plane solutions; multilink capabilities, fairness, streaming protocols, additional users, speed, and interoperability. (THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.)  Unless otherwise stated herein, no additional written information is available.  GENERAL INFORMATION:  There is not commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, make an award or awards, or to be responsible for any monies expended by any interested parties before award of a contract for the effort mentioned above.

DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT:  In accordance with (IAW) the Performance Work Statement (PWS), the contractor shall provide an annual release and update subscription software service for the equipment listed in Appendix A of the PWS.

PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT

1.0 DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES/GENERAL INFORMATION.  The contractor shall provide an Annual Release and Update Subscription (ARUS) software service necessary to ensure that JCSE continuously maintains the current Version of WAVE software required to provide uninterrupted service to our Unified customers.                                 

1.1 Background.  

Twisted Pair Solutions WAVE software technology enables and manages real-time, secure, group communications over the IP network, linking people and devices. WAVE connects people who are using disparate and often incompatible communications technologies such as two-way radios, personal computers, cell phones, and IP phones into a single, interoperable and manageable communications system via standards-based IP communications technology. WAVE technology consists of software building blocks and development tools designed around a simple and elegant concept: convert all forms of communication to IP packets, use the network to carry those packets between endpoints, and build distributed intelligence and management capabilities at the network edge to connect the endpoints together. The companys patent-pending technology converts communications from individual users devices into group-level IP packets that can be forwarded to other devices and users. Once brought into a WAVE domain, these interoperable communication sessions are subject to management and security controls, and may be bridged, recorded, joined into conferences, or routed to devices outside of the system. WAVE is media agnostic with both voice and data media types currently supported. In addition, status, presence and adaptive transport network management provide for rich collaboration among group communications participants. The result is that groups of people can talk and share real-time data, with full control, regardless of the devices or systems used.  With audio data converted into IP packets and streamed across the network, a new set of devices can directly link together and participate simply and easily in critical communications.  Careful use of IP multicast, QoS, and transcoding technology minimizes network bandwidth requirements. All of your devices, endpoints, and configurations are presented in clean, understandable, and manageable user interfaces.  Plus, since all WAVE systems are built from just a few modular components, you can configure them in an infinite number of ways to meet the unique requirements of your organization.
  
1.2 Tasks.   The contractor shall provide ARUS Service to JCSE to ensure that the WAVE Software is current and secure. The contractor provides the rights to upgrade purchased components to future releases of the licensed software in order to take advantage of product and technology enhancements.  

1.2.2 Delivery Method. The ARUS Service will be provided to JCSE via software download from the Twisted Pair Solutions Website. The software will correspond to an existing license number containing the various services based upon product configuration.

2.0 SERVICES SUMMARY.  The Services Summary identifies the performance objectives and performance thresholds for all critical tasks associated with providing the services outlined in this PWS.  This section contains only those items considered most important for mission accomplishment.  The performance objectives are those services/tasks required in the PWS.  The performance threshold briefly describes the minimum acceptable levels of service required for each requirement.  The thresholds are critical to mission success.

STATEMENT OF WORK

1.  INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW

Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the Supplier shall furnish all the necessary seafood products, qualified personnel, materials, equipment (display and other), and transportation, not otherwise provided by the Government under the terms of this Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA), as needed to perform the work set forth below.

2.  BACKGROUND INFORMATION

The Defense Commissary Agency has determined that the use of 'road shows' to market commercially available fresh, refreshed (previously frozen), and frozen seafood product is an effective merchandising method to generate sales.

3.  SCOPE OF WORK

The Supplier shall coordinate, schedule, and conduct 'road show' sales events for fresh, refreshed, and frozen seafood products at the various commissaries identified in the schedule.  The supplier shall not book more than one road show event per commissary per quarter.  At the end of a sales event, the Supplier shall remove all unsold product and Supplier owned materials and equipment from the Government installation on which the sale was conducted.

4.  OBJECTIVES

The 'road show' sales shall provide commissary patrons with a variety of fresh, refreshed, and frozen seafood products similar to those available from commercial operations within the local area of the commissary, as set forth in the schedule.  This excludes membership clubs, convenience type stores, and mass merchandisers.

6.  OWNERSHIP OF PRODUCTS

Ownership of the seafood products shall remain with the Supplier until products are scanned at a Government cash register.

7.  REIMBURSEMENT FOR SALE OF PRODUCT

The Supplier shall be paid on sales of seafood captured on the Government scanning system.

8.  CORE  SEAFOOD PRODUCTS

Core seafood products shall be offered at each road show.  Core items are identified as large and medium individually quick frozen shrimp, lobster tails, crab meat, and crab legs.

9.  OPTIONAL SEAFOOD PRODUCTS

Optional seafood items may be offered at a road show as long as the products do not compete with products sold in a store's seafood market.  The Supplier shall obtain the Store Director's approval on optional seafood products.  Optional seafood products are fresh, refreshed, and frozen seafood products other than those identified as 'core items.'  (See Paragraph 8 above.)

10.  QUALITY ASSURANCE 
 
10.1. The Supplier shall adhere to the requirements of the latest version of the FDA Food Code on sanitation and food safety.

10.2.  The Supplier shall offer seafood products provided from approved sources listed in the 'Worldwide Directory of Sanitarily Approved Food Establishment for Armed Forces Procurement' (Website: http://vets.amedd.army.mil/86256F90007C2D1D/VETCOM) or provide proof of other Federal inspections accepted by the U.S. Army Veterinary Command.  This requirement applies to partnership arrangements and subcontractors of potential suppliers. 

10.3. The Government will notify the Supplier immediately upon discovery of Supplier product exposure to unsafe temperatures.

10.4. Items that normally have a sell by date will be clearly marked on each package/container.

10.5.  COUNTRY OF ORIGIN LABELING.  In 2002, Congress incorporated Country of Origin Labeling (COOL) in the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act.  One of its many initiatives requires country of origin labeling for beef, lamb, pork, fish, perishable agricultural commodities, and peanuts. Mandatory labeling rules for farm-raised and wild fish have been in effect since April 2005.  All seafood specialty departments must comply with the requirements of COOL as they relate to point-of-purchase labeling/identification. The commissary is not required to have a Perishables Agricultural Commodities Act license; therefore, we are exempt from the audit trail requirements, but we comply with the part of the COOL regulation that is visible to the patron, i.e., point-of-purchase labeling, as much as possible. In addition, all contractors and suppliers must maintain all records needed to comply with COOL from delivery to DeCA and back to source.  

11.  SUPPLIER REQUIREMENTS

11.1. Book only one event per quarter for each commissary by contacting the Store Director.  The contact information is available at website http://www.commissaries.com/locations.cfm.    

11.2. The Supplier shall perform a site visit in person a minimum four weeks prior to the initial road show.  Subsequent in person site visits are not mandatory and may be done telephonically.  Supplier shall meet with the store management to review and complete a checklist, which is provided below.  The checklist ensures an understanding of the work effort required by both the Government and the Supplier.  The store shall finalize the booking by coordinating with their Zone Manager and then send the checklist to the East Region point of contact.  Should problems arise during the site visit that cannot be resolved by the Supplier and store management, notify the Contracting Officer.

11.2.  At least three weeks in advance of the road show, the Supplier shall provide the commissary a minimum of 1,000 copies of a flyer listing of all items to be sold and pricing, if available.  The commissary will make the flyers available to DeCA patrons in the days prior to the sale.

11.3.  At least one week prior to the road show, the Supplier shall provide a list of accurate and current UPCs (Universal Product Codes) and/or DeCA PLUs (Product Look Up Codes) to the Store Director for all items to be sold during the road show.  DeCA PLUs can be obtained from the Store Director, if needed.  The Government will input the information into the store scanning system and record sales against Department 44. 

11.4.  On the day the road show begins, the Supplier shall:

11.4.1.  Provide all necessary manpower to set up for the sale.
11.4.2.  Provide a scale and scanning labels.
11.4.3.  Provide a minimum of two people to work each sale.

(End of provision) 
NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.     The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.       OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.           Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.     Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.           If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.           Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.           Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.           In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:           solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.           Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.           If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.           The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.           Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.     The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.           Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d) (2).           If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.           This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.     To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).           Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

MODIFY: XI ? Fill in as follows:

(i)  Technical Acceptability

(ii) Price.  The offeror?s price proposal will be evaluated based on the value of the charter hire rates offered for the entire charter period (base period plus option), cost of fuel (based on DESC FY 08 fuel prices), and any other costs set forth in the offer.  For evaluation purposes the first period of performance will consist of 6 months with a six-month option, for a total period of 365 days.  The operational tempo is estimated at 85% underway laden and 15% Idle (In port).  Therefore, for evaluation purposes fuel calculations will be based upon 310 days underway laden (DRYTIME Boxes 68 and 70) at 18 knots and 55 days idle (in port) (DRYTIME Box 71).

(1)	Fuel consumption calculations will be made using the following Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) standard prices and appropriate fuel conversion factors.  The rates to be used are as follows:

DFM		per metric ton		$949.69
MGO		per metric ton		$967.97
IFO-180		per metric ton		$619.44
IFO-380 	per metric ton		$613.93

MDO will be equated to MDO and Bunker C will be equated to IFO-380, if necessary

Fuel conversion factors are as follows:

DFM/MGO/MDO: 	7.462 barrels per metric ton
IFO-180:	6.528 barrels per metric ton
IFO-380:	6.467 barrels per metric ton	

(2)	The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The proposed price will be evaluated for price reasonableness.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

	(iii) Past Performance.  Offerors will be evaluated on their performance under existing and prior contracts for similar services and as otherwise detailed in the solicitation.  Information obtained from references listed in proposals, other customers known to the Government, and other sources of useful and relevant information will be considered.

	(1) At a minimum, award will not be made to an offeror who is or within the past three years has been seriously deficient in contract performance, unless the Contracting Officer determines that the circumstances were properly beyond the offeror?s control or that the offeror took appropriate corrective action.

		(2) Offerors will be given the opportunity to address unfavorable reports of past performance.

		(3) Offerors without a past performance history relating to this solicitation shall receive a neutral evaluation.

The Government considers the most advantageous offer to be the low priced, technically acceptable offer proposed by an offeror with acceptable past performance.  However, award preference for U.S. Flag vessels and award priorities for vessels enrolled in the Voluntary Intermodal Sealift Program (VISA, at 69 FEDERAL REGISTER 25166-25168, May 5, 2004, or most current reference) and for VISA Participants (see sec. VI.A.2. of VISA) will be applied to the Government?s evaluation of offers.  Award will be made, if at all, to an offeror in the highest priority (among those offers received) set forth in sec. III.A.3. of VISA, in accordance with the award criteria set forth above.

The purpose of this request is to support the initial development of a web-based public database unfunded, meritorious NIH grant applications for the purpose of increasing and expanding biomedical research to improve human health. 
The National Health Council has a diverse group of members representing all sectors of the health care community.  Many of NHC?s members fund research themselves, and have state their interest in taking advantage of the tremendous investment of NIH funding, time and expertise that produces rigorous scoring of applications.  The NHC has clear access to members who are able to support research themselves or can identify other sources who can support the research.  While others may have experience with database development, the NHC has been working with NIH staff to leverage the NIH?s peer review process and to identify potential avenues to assist unfunded applicants, all with a view toward helping NIH and NHC members in fulfilling their missions to support research for prevention, detection, diagnosis and treatment of diseases and disabilities.  This unique mixture of experience and capability justifies the negotiations of a contract for this request as a sole source
The proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Items. A Request for Quotations (RFQ) for RFQ-NLM 08-093/EJB is not available. Organizations interested in responding to this requirement must submit your information to the National Library of Medicine, Office of Acquisitions Management, 6707 Democracy Boulevard, Suite 105, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, Attention:  Em?Ria J.

(d) The small business size standard for a Contractor providing a product which it does not manufacture itself, for a contract other than a construction or service contract, is 500 employees.

(e) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this clause, the Contractor shall make the rerepresentation required by paragraph (b) of this clause by validating or updating all its representations in the Online Representations and Certifications Application and its data in the Central Contractor Registration, as necessary, to ensure they reflect current status. The Contractor shall notify the contracting office by e-mail, or otherwise in writing, that the data have been validated or updated, and provide the date of the validation or update.

(f) If the Contractor represented that it was other than a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor may, but is not required to, take the actions required by paragraphs (e) or (g) of this clause.

(g) If the Contractor does not have representations and certifications in ORCA, or does not have a representation in ORCA for the NAICS code applicable to this contract, the Contractor is required to complete the following rerepresentation and submit it to the contracting office, along with the contract number and the date on which the rerepresentation was completed:

FDA will award a purchase order to a responsible vendor whose quote is the lowest price meeting or exceeding the required technical factors.  In order to be considered for award the vendor must submit with their quote documentation supporting that their product meets the following technical factors and sub factors:

Technical Factors: 

1. Provide a GUI to manipulate input data to send to web service.
2. Provide ability to save and reuse multiple test cases and data sets (i.e. csv, xls, database) for regression testing.
3. Supports complete test workflow from simple single service tests to complex scenarios and multiple service endpoints. 
4. Data-driven testing through data sources (Excel, CSV, Database Queries, etc). 
5. Provide ability to collect and report testing metrics.
6. Provide ability to view, modify and verify SOAP request and response messages in real time.
7. Provide ability to validate XML Schema and WSDL.
8. Provide ability to efficiently debug and unit test code in development phase as well.
9. Provide ease of adapting testing requirements to changing web service standards and protocols.
10. Provide ability to emulate completes business processes through chaining multiple web service calls.
11. Provides ability for functional, regression, performance, load, interoperability and vulnerability testing.
12. Must be compliant with section 508 standards: 1194.21, 1194.22, 1194.31 and 1194.41.

Technical Sub Factors:

1. Can be pointed at a WSDL; the tool will crawl it and build a set of positive and negative tests for each Web method on the WSDL, resulting in quicker and further progress of the testing effort from the very beginning of the testing process.  
2. The tool's auto-generated tests, are instantly executable and are actual tests, rather than empty test skeletons. Each test node in the tool's explorer is accompanied by a "traffic object" subnode that retains the most recent request/response pair generated by that test. So you can execute a test, then click on the traffic object to examine the exact exchange.
3. Tool provides for a quick and easy manipulation of project-wide behavior. 
4. The tool allows users to trace the execution of Java applications at the JVM level (without a need to change any code or to recompile), and in the context of a larger integrated system. In addition, the tool increases efficiencies in evolving the system functionality with little or no regression testing  by executing existing test case scenarios while the business application is being traced, and then establishes a snapshot of the current functionality to serve as a regression baseline for these scenarios.

Delivery of the product will be FOB destination. The contractor shall deliver the product to 5600 Fishers Lane, PKLN RM9B45 HFC-32, Rockville, MD 20857 no later than seven days after receipt of a purchase order.

The solicitation document and incorporated provision and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC).  

Vendors shall complete FAR 52.212-3, Offerors Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (JUN 2003). This can be done electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov. The contracting officer will review the vendor's online certifications at http://orca.bpn.gov to ensure that they are accurate and complete. If the vendor does not have active representations and certifications registered online they will not be considered for award.

The clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items (FEB 2007), applies to this acquisition.

In order to comply with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, the Government asks vendors to complete a Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT) and submit it with their quote. This is available at http://www.section508.gov/.

AMENDMENT TO SUBJECT COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION:

This combined synopsis/socitation is amended to include the brand name justification for ArcSight Software Support and Incidental Services in accordance with FA 11.105:

BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION

Agency:  USAF

MAJCOM:  USAFE

Contracting Activity:  700 CONS/LGCD

1.  Nature and/or description of the action being approved:   Brand name justification for purchase of ArcSight Security Event Manager software support.

2.  Type of Contract:  Firm fixed price.

3.  Description of the Supplies or Services Required:  Purchase of ArcSight Security Event Manager software support including the ArcSight Manager, ArcSight database, ArcSight console, and all associated ArcSight agents.  The initial purchase of the software and hardware for this product was approximately $500K.  This software support has been purchased annually for the past three years.

4.  Estimated value of the supplies or services required:  The annual price for support of the ArcSight product is approximately $____________.

5.  Authority permitting other than full and open competition:  FAR 11.105(a)

6.  Justification Rationale:  The USAFE Network Operations and Security Center currently uses the ArcSight Security Event Manager product to fill a role that is currently void in our security environment.  The ArcSight product allows us to bring logs from multiple devices into one single database in order to perform correlation.  The continued use of this product will allow USAFE to continue using the rule sets, filters, and anomaly detection that has been developed in ArcSight over the last three years.  It will also allow us to interface our information with other EUCOM components such as DISA Europe and the Army Computer Emergency Response Team in Manheim which also uses ArcSight.  

7.  Market Research Information and Efforts Made to Ensure Offers are Solicited from as Many Potential Sources:  During the selection of ArcSight three years ago, there was no other tool that filled the role of Security Event Manager in an enterprise environment.  Moving to a different tool after three years of development with ArcSight would be cost intensive.  Associated costs would include price of a new software product, new hardware to support the product, training for existing personnel to use the new product, and the money and time required to duplicate the content we have already developed using ArcSight.  The cost of all these associated items would likely approach or exceed $__________ today.

8.  Best Value:  Procurement of the ArcSight licenses and software updates in support of ArcSight under the GSA Multiple Award Schedule (if available) or open market basis, best meets the agency?s needs, costs, special features and the Air Force standardization effort and therefore, represents best value for the USAFE and Air Force. 

9.  Any Other Facts Supporting the Justification:  The intent of this action is to minimize costs and maintain current capabilities through uninterrupted receipt of ArcSight software updates and support to defend USAFE networks from attacks and ensure day-to-day operation of USAFE and its mission accomplishment.


I certify that the justification provided herein is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.


						 
                            ______//Signed//___________

                            Date:   21 March 08


I certify that the justification provided herein is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.   

                            _________//Signed//_________

A hole will be cored through the flood wall and steel cable ran through it to an attachment point on the gate.  Therefore, it is n ecessary to have the sheaves angled out to allow clearance for the pipe caps to be secured to the threaded pipe sealed in the wall when the pulley system is not  in use.  The opening and closing will be accomplished via a hydraulic winch rated at a 10-ton capacity.  The pulleys are<BR>carrying a horizontal load and moment from the force of the line (i.e. the base plate and bolts through wall).  The expected force required to open and close the gate at the sheaves will be working load of 20-kips.  <BR><BR>1.	Total Quantity = 8ea. (4ea. Gate Q1 and 4ea. Gate Q2)<BR><BR>2.	Entire pulley/sheave block system design including attachments to the wall, shall be designed by  the pulley system supplier, and the design calculations and shop drawings shall be submitted to the contracting officer for approval prior to fabrication.<BR><BR>3.	All the design calculations and pulley/sheave block system assembly details, shall be sign ed and sealed by a professional engineer licensed to practice in the State of Missouri.<BR><BR>Additional information pertaining to proposed Bid:<BR><BR>1.	The pulley/sheave block supplier will NOT be responsible for designing the bracket to attach the ste el rope to flood gates.<BR><BR>2.	Distance from the top of flood wall down to pulley/sheave block will be approximately 15.5-feet.<BR><BR>3.	See drawing sheet C001 and C002 for locations of pulley/sheave block system in relation to Bobcat platform for winc h.<BR><BR>4.	Pulley sheave block supplier is NOT responsible for checking the structural integrity of the existing floodwalls for the induced loading effects imposed by the pulley/sheave block system.<BR><BR>5.	See drawing sheet S004 for gate attachment po ints for steel rope.<BR><BR><BR>6.	See attached pipe detail of 5 inch hole through wall.<BR><BR>7.	Detail at bottom left shows the top of the pulley/sheave indicating the need for a rope keeper at the top, in order to keep steel rope from sliding out when untensioned.  Further detail is not required.<BR><BR>Final Note: Please use the following information provided to interpret the drawings or specifications accordingly to provide an accurate bid proposal.
