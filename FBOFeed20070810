The Fortinet suite of products combine Antivirus, Antispyware, Antispam, Intrusion Protection and firewall in a single product along with the ability to address these risks at the point of entry and at wire speed. No other known product on the market has this ability. The Virus Incident Response Team (VIRT) issued a request for Information in November 2006 for perimeter AntiVirus products. The VIRT reviewed products from ten companies through formal presentations, product research as well as interviewing existing users of the products of these companies to determine the best value for the Department of State. These ten solutions included eight on premises software/appliance solutions and two off premises services solutions.<BR><BR>

Use of third party software that has not been tested by the Department nor has been proven in concert with Department specific server configurations may result in OS\application conflicts, increase the complexity of integration, and ultimately render the "thin" solution inoperable.  Citrix offers the department an online licensing system with built in tracking.  Also, the Citrix ICA protocol, which is the backbone of how thin clients communicate to the Citrix Server "Farm", requires only a small amount of bandwidth (22K) for minimal operations.  This allows the department more flexibility in where and how thin clients will be deployed. To ensure compatibility with existing network components in the field, the software must be a Citrix brand and provided by a Citrix reseller. As this is a brand anme only justification, no one contractor's unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department's requirements as a key component of the Department's networking system.<BR><BR>

For purposes of standardizing the infrastructure components of the HR system it is necessary for this equipment to be the Dell brand name. •	Dell provides common images and components with its servers platforms — helping to simplify management and cut costs. Dell has spent the last decade building commonality into the server family with the specific goal of simplifying management and maintenance, while reducing cost and complexity.  •	ImageWatch™ — Dell provides a road map of upcoming software changes, allowing HR to better plan updates.  •	Block updates — By delivering scheduled changes, Dell can help minimize the number of updates HR makes each year.<BR><BR>•	Image commonality — By reducing the number of overall images in the Dell PowerEdge server line, Dell has reduced the time required for image maintenance.  •	Component commonality — The Dell PowerEdge Server Family share common components (memory, hard drives, management cards and more), which help improve efficiency during build and servicing.  •	Management commonality — Dell PowerEdge Servers are managed through a common interface to help maximize efficiency and streamline management. Dell OpenManage is provided with ALL Dell systems at no extra cost. OpenManage provides one management interface for hardware, software, and operating systems.  •	Dell tracks configurations of every product down to the component level, which allows Dell to quickly and easily analyze product performance and take corrective action when needed.  •	Dell provides investment protection when migrating to future Blade Server architectures (ie, going from PowerEdge 1855 to PowerEdge 1955).  •	Dell advocates use of industry-standard resource management software where competitors are proprietary (customer lock-in) and expensive.  •	Human Resources strive to maintain a single point of accountability, with common network and systems management tools compatible with current equipment. The existing IT infrastructure has been developed utilizing an architecture based on a Dell sourced platform. To promote an overall lower Total Cost of Ownership, this procurement should be considered incremental to the existing infrastructure. Utilizing Dell for these additional enterprise products and services will provide continuity and single point of contact responsibility for the overall infrastructure.  •	Having Dell as the single vendor for the entire enterprise mix of servers and storage products, including software, provides a clear escalation path and resolution of all issues to maintain critical systems.  •	Dell Systems Management provides a single tool to manage and monitor the entire enterprise of servers and storage products.<BR><BR>

(d) The Department of State currently intends to use Vista in Protected Mode in the future when all devices at all worldwide locations have sufficient capacity to permit an upgrade from the XP operating system.<BR><BR>The Office of Consular Systems and Technology (CA/CST) of the Department’s Bureau of Consular Affairs requires the purchase of the software licenses named in para (1). The licenses are essential elements of the proprietary Consular software application supporting and making possible the  Bureau’s worldwide 10 print fingerprint capture initiative, which must be completed by the end of calendar year 2007. The Homeland Security Council decided on June 7, 2005 that the USG standard for biometric screening of foreign nationals coming to the United States should transition from two fingerprints to ten fingerprints.  This will enable the two major USG fingerprint systems, the DHS IDENT system and the FBI IAFIS system, to establish interoperability.  The transition to ten prints also will enable the Bureau of Consular Affairs to clear visa applicants' fingerprints against the FBI IAFIS system, which in turn will allow consular officers to more effectively screen out applicants who are ineligible due to criminal history records.  Consular officers eventually will be relieved of the task of reviewing long lists of non-exact NCIII name results to determine if an applicant may have a criminal history record.  DHS/CBP also is moving to ten-print collection at the ports of entry, expecting to deploy by 2008. The 10 print capture initiative will ensure that the Department of State fully complies with Section 303 of The Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002.  The legislation specifically states that the Department of State must “issue to aliens only machine-readable tamper resistant visas and other travel and entry documents that use biometric identifiers”.   To capture applicant fingerprints, third party software must be integrated in the Consular software application. This allows for immediate fingerprint quality measurements, finger segmentation and packaging in a submission format compatible with FBI systems.  The NISTPack Server application is the third party software used by CA.<BR><BR>CA/CST’s Systems Engineering team identified two products that offered what were judged to be acceptable levels of support for this process. These products were developed by Cogent, Inc. and Aware, Inc. The DoS used the COGENT software application to support the single fingerprint (index finger) capture required for the two print bio-visa program. However, in tests of the Cogent and Aware products conducted prior to the initiation of 10 print capture, Aware’s NISTPack software was judged better able to support the program. The Aware product’s fingerprint scoring was more accurate and outputs more frequently conformed to the FBI’s and other Federal agencies’ acceptance requirements.  It was also noted the fingerprint capture process was approximately 10 seconds faster per applicant when NISTPack was used than it was when the Cogent product was used.  A ten 10 second processing time savings per applicant is of particular significance at large volume posts processing 2000 applicants per day as it is equivalent to a full day’s processing time.  In summation, CA/CST believes that it is in the best interests of the Government to acquire the Aware NISTPack Server and site licenses without delay so that the Department’s worldwide implementation and use of the 10 print fingerprint capture system modules may be completed by the end of calendar 2007.   As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements. The Aware NISTPack Server software  has undergone tests and assessment, evaluation for overseas deployments and received final approval from the Department of State Consular Affairs Configuration Control Board (CCB).<BR><BR>

The Office of Business Services anticipates that this effort will be available only from the original source and â€œNo Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.â€  This is predicated on a recent 100% small business set-aside competition where several other chairs were extensively considered and evaluated, and it was determined that only one chair met the Agencyâ€™s minimum ergonomic requirements.

Goodmanâ€™s Inc. is a small business and is the only authorized distributor of Herman Miller products in the Albuquerque area, where the chairs are to be delivered.  The applicable NAICS code for the proposed acquisition is 423210 with a size standard of 100 employees. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Firms who want to challenge the sole-source must submit an interest letter than demonstrates the firmâ€™s ability to provide an equivalent supply as described above.  Interested parties must provide rationale as to why they should be considered.  All interested firms must respond by August 16, 2007, 2:00 P.M.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOLE SOURCE SYNOPSIS!  The 45th Contracting Squadron has a sole source requirement for a germanium coaxial detector P/N GC4519, cryopulse cryostat P/N SDPROD CP-5F-P, a remote detector chamber with 4 inch neck P/N RDC-4, and the ISOCS/LABSOCS P/N ISOXCAL.  This is a Sole Source with Canberra Industries IAW FAR 6.302-1.  Canberra Industries is the only source capable of fulfilling the government's requirement based on configuration requirements. The Air Force has a unique requirement for a portable detection /spectroscopy system. This detection system must fit within the existing collimated lead (Pb) shield system (tomb) that attaches to a cart.  This configuration allows for spectroscopy and portability. Canberra is the only supplier who currently manufactures a product that will fit.  The Canberra Multi Channel Analyzer (MCA), utilized as a High Voltage control mechanism, is both hardware and software controlled.  The purchase of any other detection system will require both the purchase of another lead (Pb) tomb, significant re-configuration or the purchase of a new MCA all if which add significant additional cost.  This item utilizes Standard Industrial Code (SIC) 3826 with a business size of 500 and North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of 334516.  Interested firms may identify their capability to respond to this requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes; however, the government will consider any responses from capable sources received within 10 days after date of publication of this synopsis.  45 CONS/LGCB has determined that Canberra Industries is the only source capable of providing this requirement.  Phone calls will not be accepted.  Point of contact is Antonio V. Cazares, contract specialist, 45 CONS/LGCBB, 1201 Edward H. White II, Street MS7200, Patrick AFB, FL  32925, Antonio.Cazares@patrick.af.mil.

The contractor designated as a prime shall serve as the focal point for interactions with the Government during the entire phase of this acquisition process.  Prime contractors may only participate on a single team. The number of team members per team is not limited.  All team leaders and teaming partners must be in compliance with all terms and conditions of the solicitation prior to submission of a response.  If a response to this RFP fails to demonstrate compliance with these terms and conditions, the Vendor will not be considered for an award.

As a result of this RFP, the Government intends to make an estimated five (5) awards, yet reserves the right to award none, or any other number of contracts, depending on the quality of submissions.  The decision to award more than one contract is within the Government?s unilateral discretion and subject to the Contracting Officer?s determination as to whether or not multiple awards are in the Government?s best interests.  The actual number of awards will depend heavily on the evaluation of the proposals. The evaluation factors will include: Technical Capability, Past Performance, Small Business Participation, and Cost. 

The VACA anticipates that subsequent task orders will be placed against the awarded contract(s) over a five-year period.  Orders will be competed using criteria per the ordering procedures outlined in the FAR Part 16.5. These orders will be priced against established hourly rates, discounted as applicable, for a total firm fixed price or ceiling price against performance based requirements to the maximum extent possible. The anticipated award of these contracts and subsequent delivery orders are expected in early FY08.  The VACA estimates that the total price of all work to be performed under the contract(s) will exceed 
$1 billion.  This figure is only an estimate and there is no guarantee that any orders will be placed.

?Request for Proposal Issued: 		27 August

<DESC>NOAA intends to monitor vessel compliance with ship strike reduction measures vis a vis threatened marine mammals. Initially NOAA wishes to explore the feasability of doing so through remote sensing, specifically AIS and related technologies.  Therefore, NOAA seeks to explore the feasibility of developing a unified network of receivers and centrally processed, parsed, stored, and relayed data.  As such, this call for proposals is about assessing existing U.S. east coast AIS capabilities and to the extent deficiencies exist, assessing the feasibility of developing an U.S. east coast-wide AIS network.  In addition, the contractor will prepare a draft plan for implementing such a system, identify any obstacles, identify the soft- and hard-ware and technical requirements, and assess the costs associated with creating such a system and implementing an AIS-based program. The p[eriod of performance for this initial phase shall not exceed one year.  Evaluation using simplified acquisition procedures shall utilize technical approach, past performance and price.  A time and materials order is contemplated.  This is a simplified acquisition under the SAT.

<DESC>The Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs (OJP), Human Resources Division (HRD), intends to award on a sole source basis, a Firm Fixed Price Purchase Order to The Graduate School, USDA, 600 Maryland Avenue, SW, Ste. 180, Washington, DC for the Leadership Effectiveness Inventory (LEI), a 360 degree assessment tool.  

The Office of Justice Programs, in an effort to continue to build upon the groundwork laid from the Foundations of Training Seminar, would like to implement an instrument that is designed to uncover the specific development needs unique to each individual leader.  The purpose of this instrument is to provide all OJP leadership with a 360 degree feedback tool which uses the Office of Personnel Management?s Executive Core Qualifications.  This includes producing a pilot assessment with top management as well as development and delivery of an assessment to all OJP leaders, including a kick off meeting.  Additionally, feedback sessions will be conducted separately for the pilot group of top management personnel, as well as for the remaining OJP leaders.  Finally, each OJP bureau/office head will receive an individual briefing session on reading and interpreting data for results.  

For more than 85 years, the Graduate School has provided personnel development solutions to the Federal Government.  Specifically, The Graduate School, USDA is uniquely positioned to respond to this requirement as they use a proprietary assessment tool called the Leadership Effectiveness Inventory (LEI), which is grounded in the OPM's Executive Core Qualifications and leadership competencies.  The Graduate School has effectively used this tool to assist more than 5,000 Federal employees and their agencies.

Their success in developing such programs and their use of an assessment grounded on the OPM qualifications and competencies, uniquely qualify The Graduate School, USDA to perform the required service to OJP Human Resource Division.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION.

<DESC>The vendor will provide software and associated consulting and implementation services for OPIC to upgrade from its current legacy Intuity Audix voicemail system to a unified messaging solution.  The solution will be more efficient and effective by allowing staff to view/listen to voicemail messages via integration with the OPIC e-mail system.  The vendor will confirm OPIC?s detailed requirements, perform on-site tasks for implementation and integration, and obtain OPIC?s acceptance and sign-off at the conclusion of the project.  The services will include replacing the current voicemail system with a unified messaging solution that is capable of integrating with OPIC?s current legacy Definity G3Si Private Branch Exchange (PBX) via existing analog connections as well as support the OPIC?s future upgrade to a new PBX.  The unified messaging solution must integrate with OPIC?s existing Microsoft Exchange 2003 infrastructure for single message storing.  The solution must also incorporate one step function keys, the ability to grow with OPIC?s Continuity of Operations and Disaster Recovery implementations (support remote hosting and broadcast messaging) and the ability to establish menu driven caller applications

<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement for a Photron FastCam-SA1 Gigabit Ethernet Color, 16GB High-Speed Video System to support upcoming testing (R&D and Ballistic) for the Orion Program.   Description of Requirement: - This color FastCam SA-1, 150K-C2 has full frame resolution of 1024x1024 at frame rates up to 5,000 frames per second, and will record up to 150,000 frames per second at reduced resolutions.  This single-piece self-contained camera system includes 16GB of onboard memory for storage of acquired images.  The system includes PC control software, and operator’s Manual and is compatible with both C and F Mount Lenses.  36-Month Subscription, 1-Year Warranty, and On-site Training.  NASA/GRC intends to purchase the items from MOTION ENGINEERING COMPANY, INC. This recommendation is made pursuant to FAR 13.106, for the acquisition of supplies or services determined to be reasonably available from only one source.  Competition is impractical for the following reasons: The Equipment is the newest next generation CMOS sensor Technology. The system is superior to light sensitivity and color fidelity with unsurpassed ease of operation to permit high speed imaging of extremely fast moving objects during R&D and Ballistic testing. MOTION ENGINEERING COMPANY, INC. is the only distributor for the Ohio area who can provide the Photron FastCam-SA1.  Purchase of this equipment from a different vendor would result in unacceptable or inadequate specification requirements. Therefore it would be the best interest of the government to purchase directly from MOTION ENGINEERING COMPANY, INC. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on 08/14/2007. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications ARE NOT acceptable in response to this notice.  An Ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to award a fixed cost plus award fee contract to a statistical contractor, with a base performance period of 26-months/one production cycle and two 26-months/production cycles options beginning each year thereafter, to assist CMS in providing statistical and analytical functions necessary to implement an error rate under the Payment Error Rate Measurement Program (PERM) for  Medicaid and the State Children?s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). The NAICS code used is 541990 however, CMS has not determined if this will be a small business set-aside. Small businesses should meet all requirements for a cost type contract at time of award such as accounting system must be adequate for determining costs applicable to the contract and that FAR Clause 52.219-14 Limitations of Subcontracting will be incorporated into the solicitation and resultant contract.  

BACKGROUND/DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES: CMS must estimate payment error rates in Medicaid and SCHIP as directed by the Improper Payments Information Act (IPIA) of 2002 (Public Law 107-300).  The IPIA directs each executive agency, in accordance with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance, to review all of its programs and activities annually, identify those that may be susceptible to significant improper payments, estimate the annual amount of improper payments, and submit those estimates to Congress.  The IPIA defines improper payments as: (a) any payment that should not have been made or that was made in an incorrect amount, including both overpayments and underpayments, under statutory, contractual, administrative, or other legally applicable requirements; and (b) payments made to an ineligible beneficiary, any duplicate payments, payments for services not received, and any payment that does not account for credit for applicable discounts. 
 
CMS has been testing and refining various methodologies to estimate payment accuracy and payment error in Medicaid and SCHIP since fiscal year (FY) 2002.  CMS explored several pilot projects to develop its error rate methodologies from FY 2002 through FY 2005.  After the error rate pilots concluded, CMS implemented the PERM methodology to produce FY 2006 and FY 2007 State error rates for fee-for-service claims, managed care capitation payments, and eligibility determinations.  This is the methodology that CMS intends to continue to use into the foreseeable future to produce national error rates that comply with the requirements of IPIA.   
 
Under the current strategy for PERM, CMS contracts with three entities to identify error rates in the Medicaid and SCHIP programs: (1) a statistical contractor; (2) a documentation/database contractor; and (3) a review contractor. The statistical contractor performs all statistical, sampling and error rate calculation functions; the documentation/database contractor formats State claims data, gathers medical policies from States, and requests medical records from providers; and the review contractor performs the data processing and medical reviews in the States selected for review.   All three contractors exchange information and work together to produce the fee-for-service (FFS), managed care, and eligibility error rates for the Medicaid and SCHIP programs. 
The statistical contractor selected through the forthcoming solicitation will perform the statistical functions for the PERM measurement of each program, which include: 1) collecting State quarterly  FFS and managed care claims data; 2) stratifying Medicaid and SCHIP FFS claims by dollar value; 3) selecting quarterly FFS and managed care claims samples for each of the sampled States; 4) calculating the  State-specific FFS and managed care error rates; 5) calculating the national error rates for the FFS, managed care, and eligibility components; and 6) calculating the overall national program error rate.  The statistical contractor is also responsible for reviewing the eligibility sampling plans of the States selected for review and for all of the tasks outlined in the attached draft Statement of Work (SOW). The statistical contractor must work effectively and efficiently with CMS, the documentation/database contractor, the review contractor, and Medicaid /SCHIP State representatives in meeting its responsibilities.
The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 541990.  This is not an invitation for proposals, request for proposal (RFP), or other solicitation and in no way obligates the Government to award a contract.  CMS anticipates release of the Request for Proposal on July 20, 2007 and it will be made available electronically at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  We anticipate oral presentations of technical proposals beginning the week of August 20th and an award date of no later that September 28, 2007.

<DESC>In accordance with Simplified Acquisition procedures the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG),  intend to procure on a sole-source basis with the University of Ghana Medical School, PO Box 4236, Accra, Ghana for the continuation of a study on the estimation of burden of prostate diseases in Accra, Ghana. The goal of this study was to characterize the burden of prostate cancer in Accra, Ghana, for comparison with other population groups.  The field work of the study was completed in 2006. However, during data editing and retrieval, DCEG discovered a number of issues that need to be addressed to ensure the quality of the study data, including data verification, inviting a number of subjects to return for biopsy, cutting pathology slides, and sending slides and specimens to the NCI repository, that need to be tied up before the study can be entirely completed. The contractor shall perform the following tasks: 1)  Maintain the study office, including phone lines and computer;  2)  Retrieve hard copies of medical record, pathology reports, and interview forms at the request of the NCI investigators;  3) Review and send accurate information to NCI for verification;  4)  Prepare and review specimen shipping forms;  5)  Coordinate with the pathology department to cut both stained and unstained slides;  6)  Record block and specimen ID for each slide;  7)  Keep a log of treatment and patient follow-up;  and 8)  Report any adverse events of treatment to NCI investigators.  The field work of the study was conducted in Ghana and the hard copies of the data belong to University of Ghana and are stored in Ghana.  The University of Ghana is the only source known to the NCI Research that has access the required data and population to complete this study.  This  is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the entire above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if it can meet the requirements of this synopsis.  An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1PM EDT (local Washington, D.C. time) on August 24, 2007.  Faxed and emailed capability statements are NOT authorized.  All questions must be in writing and may be emailed to Debbie Moore at dm170b@nih.gov or faxed (301) 402-4513.  It is the vendor's responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 and verify that questions were received.  In order to receive an award from the NCI contractors must be registered in the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).  Please refer to http://orca.bpn.gov in order to register.   In addition, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted.  NAICS: 541990; Size Standard is $6.5 million.

For printed circuit boards or printed wiring boards where MIL-PRF-55110(formerly MIL-P-55110) or MIL-P-50884 is cited, it is recommended that MIL-PRF-31032 be utilized.  MIL-PRF-55110 is presently inactive for new designs and has been replaced by MIL-PRF-31032.  MIL-P-50884 will become inactive for new designs and replaced by MIL-PRF-31032.  Since there currently is no equivalent document for the cancelled MIL-S-13949 (formerly MIL-P-13949), DSCC recommends that the contractor have a method of assuring that laminate materials used in conjunction with DSCC contracts be at least equivalent in quality and reliability to that which was available prior to the cancellation of MIL-S-13949 on November 30, 1998.

This is a 100% small business set aside.  See numbered note 1.  Copies of this solicitation will be available on the DSCC website after 08/25/07.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation for a federal contract and is therefore not governed by federal procurement procedures.

Over the last 160 years, the Smithsonian Institution (Smithsonian) has grown to include 19 museums, nine research centers and the National Zoological Park, and is now the largest museum and research complex in the world. The Smithsonian plays a fundamental educational role in society by allowing Americans to experience their historical, cultural, and scientific heritages, while furthering research in each of these areas. The Smithsonian's mission revolves around two key themes that date back to James Smithson's original founding bequest: the increase of knowledge (through research) and the diffusion of knowledge (through exhibitions, educational activities, publications, public programs, access to collections and other means).

For many years, the Smithsonian has engaged in a variety of revenue-generating business activities in furtherance of its mission. These revenues provide essential financial support for the maintenance and growth of the Smithsonian's programs, research, and collections. 

One of the Smithsonian's primary business activities involves the operation of stores inside the museums and at three (3) other locations (airports).  The stores are currently operated by Smithsonian Business Ventures (SBV). The SBV-operated stores (SBV Stores) offer merchandise that reflects the mission of the Smithsonian and the respective museum in which they operate, and provide the visitor with an extension of the Smithsonian educational experience. From space travel to political history to contemporary art to animal life, the broad array of Smithsonian subject areas offer the opportunity to create a rich and varied inventory of creative merchandise that appeals to all segments of the visiting public.  Short term/temporary exhibitions, seasonal celebrations, and periodic special events also offer the chance to further tailor merchandise offerings.

The Smithsonian is in the process of evaluating the efficiency and profitability of the stores and seeks to acquire information from the marketplace regarding the possibility of outsourcing the SBV Stores. The goal is to increase its economic benefits, enhance the visitor experiences, and share risk. Specifically, the Smithsonian seeks information regarding whether outsourcing of the SBV Stores is feasible, such that a third party operator is capable of assuming all of the SBV store operations, significantly increase profits for the Institution and its museums while at the same time respecting, enhancing and furthering the Smithsonian's global and museums' specific missions through the selection, development, and sale of mission-related merchandise and products. The information gathered as part of the RFI process will be used by the Smithsonian Secretary and a task force of staff and advisory board members to make recommendations to the Smithsonian Institution Board of Regents regarding the future operation of the SBV Stores.

The Smithsonian Institution seeks informational submissions (RFI Submission(s)) from private and public entities (Respondents) qualified and experienced to operate retail stores with great sensitivity to an iconic brand's reputation.  Retail experience in museums, zoos or cultural destination environments is preferred. The Smithsonian will consider responses to the Request for Information (RFI) and determine whether to solicit formal proposals through a Request for Proposal process (RFP) at a later point in time.  Respondents are hereby notified that this is not a solicitation for a federal contract and is therefore not governed by federal procurement procedures.

Registering prospective respondents (any entity desiring a copy of the RFI) must provide complete name, address, point of contact, phone number including area code, and email address.  Registering prospective respondents must provide written request for the RFI from the Smithsonian Institution, Office of Contracting, P.O. Box 37012, MRC 1200, Washington, DC 20013-7012, Attn: Cindy Zarate (fax: 202-633-7308).  Registered Prospective respondents will receive an electronic copy of the RFI when it is available, on or about August 17, 2007. Respondents will be required to submit an RFI submission document as set forth in the RFI.

Replace existing relay-based  system with solid-state controls, refinish cab interiors and additional work in accordance  with the drawings and specifications to be provided with the IFB.  Contractor shall also refurbish the individual cars and car controls to meet current code requirements, and  upgrade the lighting and interior finishes.  Work includes general construction, alterations, mechanical and electrical work, elevators and necessary removal of existing structures  and construction and certain other items.  It is critical that the contractor for this job provide a state of the art control system  that will serve this facility for the next 30 years.  The existing system was installed  in 1949 and overhauled in 1991.   The coordination and pace of the work is also extremely critical as these 4 elevators  represent all vertical transportation for the facility (two passenger and two freight  elevators).  The time required to complete each elevator must be minimized to insure  that patient care is not compromised. These systems will result in greater than normal challenges to retrofit modern controls.   Contractor shall have experience not only in retrofitting controls, but also in maintenance  of older systems. Estimated price range for this acquisition is between $1,000,000 and $2,000,000.   This acquisition shall be conducted and award shall be made on a full, open,  and unrestricted basis.   This acquisition shall be conducted as an Invitation For Bids (IFB)  IAW FAR Part 14 Sealed Bidding.   Solicitation shall be issued and Award shall be made pursuant to the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program.

<DESC>The VA Great Lakes Acquisition Center intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Dr. Watson, DDS for General Dentist services for the Tomah VA Medical Center, Tomah, WI, beginning August 27, 2007.  This dentist will provide services at the Tomah VAMC on an as needed basis, for a minimum of two days per month, but no more than ten days per month.  To the best of our knowledge Dr. Watson, DDS, is the only dentist that can meet these intermittent needs of the government.   This procurement is being conducted in accordance FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements.  Contract price is firm fixed unit price and the NAICS Code is 621210. This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  No solicitations documents are available and telephone requests will not be honored.  However, if a firm believes it can meet the requirements it must furnish information about their services and specific dentist candidate(s), as well as, current references of the specific dentist(s) they are presenting, to the Contracting Officer within (5) calendar days from the date of publication of this synopsis.  Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirement.    Information must be sent to the Contracting Officer, VAMC GLAC, 5000 W. National Ave Bldg. 5, Milwaukee WI 53295 or via fax to (414) 902-5440.  Responses received will be evaluated however; a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no responses are received, the GLAC will proceed with the sole source contract with Dr. Watson, DDS.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<SOLNBR>W912DY-07-R-0054
<RESPDATE>091007
<ARCHDATE>11092007
<CONTACT>sarah.annerton, 256-895-1167
<DESC>CONTRACT INFORMATION:  This synopsis publicizes contract actions proposed to support the US Army Engineering and Support Centers Medical Repair and Renewal (MRR) Program, A-E requirements.  The purpose of the MRR program is to support its various cus tomers throughout the Continental United States, District of Columbia, Alaska, Hawaii, and U.S. Territories and possessions with their medical facility repair, renovation, conversion, alteration, addition, construction, equipment procurement/installation, and maintenance requirements.  In order to accomplish this objective, the MRR program proposes to award multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts, under which firm-fixed price (FFP) task orders may be issued for the provision of Ar chitect-Engineer (A-E) services.  The contracts will be procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6.  See numbered note 24 for general information on the A-E selection process.   The North American Industrial Classific ation System code is 541330 and the size standard is $4,500,000.00.  The proposed contract ordering period is for one (1) base year and four (4) one-year option periods.  The total requirements expected to be awarded under the MRR A-E contracts are anticip ated to equal approximately $15,000,000.  The Government will conduct two separate competitions for award of ID/IQ A-E contracts to support the MRR A-E requirements (one unrestricted and one restricted for competition amongst Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned  (SDVO) small businesses).  This public announcement is for the unrestricted competition and is intended to result in multiple awards (approximately 2).  Of the total $15,000,000 programmatic capacity, the total capacity of $10,000,000 is estimated for the  unrestricted MATOC pool which will be shared amongst the awardees in the MATOC pool.  The A-E Contractors and its subcontractors, suppliers, and consultants selected for award will not be considered eligible for an MRR construction (with design-build capa bilities) contract (see W912DY-06-R-0028, W912DY-07-R-0030, and W912DY-07-R-0031).  Firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work.  The highest ranked firm selected for negotiations will be  provided a Request for Price Proposal (RFPP).  If a mutually satisfactory contract cannot be negotiated, a RFPP package will be provided to the firm ranked next on the approved selection report.  This procedure would continue until all mutually satisfacto ry contract(s) have been negotiated and awarded.  Placement of task orders will be consistent with FAR subpart 36.6, Architect-Engineer Services and subpart 16.5, Indefinite Delivery Contracts.  The Government will provide each awardee a fair opportunity t o be considered for each task order exceeding $3,000 issued under the multiple ID/IQ A-E contracts.  The Government will consider award of the A-E task order to the SDVO awardee prior to consideration of the unrestricted awardees.  If it is determined inap propriate to award the task order to the SDVO awardee, the Government will then consider the unrestricted awardees for the task order award.  If the Government has information available to ensure that each awardee is provided a fair opportunity to be consi dered for each order, the Government may not contact each of the multiple awardees under the contract before selecting an order awardee.  When selecting an order awardee the Government will consider:  a.   Capability to perform the level of complexity requ ired for successful execution of the task;  b.   Past performance on earlier orders under the contract, including quality, timeliness and cost control; c.   Potential impact on other orders placed with the contractor; and d.   Minimum order requirements. Cost will not be an evaluation factor to be considered in selecting an order awardee.  Formal evaluation plans and scoring of quotes or offers will not be requi red.  The Government will give every awardee a fair opportunity to be considered for a delivery-order or task-order exceeding $3,000 unless an exemption provided in FAR 16.505(b)(2) applies.  PROJECT INFORMATION:  The Medical Repair and Renewal A-E contracts provide all services required to prepare plans, specifications, work plans and other supporting documents necessary for execution of the MRR projects issued by task order.  As part of the d esign effort the contractor may be required to survey the problem areas, evaluate and recommend solutions.  The level of detail and format of the design packages may vary dependent upon the complexity of the MRR project.  A complete design, including a bid  schedule, an order of work clause, a construction contractor submittal register, quantity and cost estimated, MCACES construction cost estimates, a proposed construction schedule, design analyses and calculations, a design document report, an engineering considerations and instructions report, and a draft operations and maintenance manual shall be developed for each project.  In addition to project designs the contractor may be required to conduct studies, investigations, surveying and mapping, tests, eval uations, consultations, comprehensive planning, program management, conceptual designs, value engineering, construction phase services, soils engineering, drawing reviews, preparation of operating and maintenance manuals, preparation of parametric estimate s, equipment and systems commissioning and other related services. Offerors must have specialized experience and technical competence in medical facility, equipment, and systems design.  In accordance with DFARS clause 252.236-7009, Option for Supervision and Inspection Services, the Government may direct the A-E Contractor to perform any part or all of the supervision and inspection services for the construction contract.   SELECTION CRITERIA:  The selection criteria for the basic ID/IQ contracts are listed below and are equal in importance (first by major criterion and then by each sub-criterion).  Criteria a-e are primary.  Criteria f-g are secondary and will only be used a s tie-breakers among firms that are essentially technically equal.   a.

<DESC>CONTRACT INFORMATION:  This synopsis publicizes contract actions proposed to support the US Army Engineering and Support Centers Medical Repair and Renewal (MRR) Program, A-E requirements.  The purpose of the MRR program is to support its various cus tomers throughout the Continental United States, District of Columbia, Alaska, Hawaii, and U.S. Territories and possessions with their medical facility repair, renovation, conversion, alteration, addition, construction, equipment procurement/installation, and maintenance requirements.  In order to accomplish this objective, the MRR program proposes to award multiple Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts, under which firm-fixed price (FFP) task orders may be issued for the provision of Ar chitect-Engineer (A-E) services.  The contracts will be procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6.  See numbered note 24 for general information on the A-E selection process.   The North American Industrial Classific ation System code is 541330 and the size standard is $4,500,000.00.  The proposed contract ordering period is for one (1) base year and four (4) one-year option periods.  The total requirements expected to be awarded under the MRR A-E contracts are anticip ated to equal approximately $15,000,000.  The Government will conduct two separate competitions for award of ID/IQ A-E contracts to support the MRR A-E requirements (one unrestricted and one restricted for competition amongst Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned  (SDVO) small businesses).  This public announcement is for the Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned (SDVO) competition and is intended to result in a single award.  Of the total $15,000,000 programmatic capacity, the total capacity of $5,000,000 is estimated fo r the SDVO award.  The A-E Contractor and its subcontractors, suppliers, and consultants selected for award will not be considered eligible for an MRR construction (with design-build capabilities) contract (see W912DY-06-R-0028, W912DY-07-R-0030, and W912D Y-07-R-0031).  Placement of task orders will be consistent with FAR subpart 36.6, Architect-Engineer Services and subpart 16.5, Indefinite Delivery Contracts.  The Government will provide each awardee a fair opportunity to be considered for each task order  exceeding $3,000 issued under the multiple ID/IQ A-E contracts.  The Government will consider award of the A-E task order to the SDVO awardee prior to consideration of the unrestricted awardees.  If it is determined inappropriate to award the task order t o the SDVO awardee, the Government will then consider the unrestricted awardees for the task order award.  If the Government has information available to ensure that each awardee is provided a fair opportunity to be considered for each order, the Governmen t may not contact each of the multiple awardees under the contract before selecting an order awardee.  When selecting an order awardee the Government will consider:  a.   Capability to perform the level of complexity required for successful execution of th e task;  b.   Past performance on earlier orders under the contract, including quality, timeliness and cost control; c.   Potential impact on other orders placed with the contractor; and d.   Minimum order requirements.  Cost will not be an evaluation fact or to be considered in selecting an order awardee.  Formal evaluation plans and scoring of quotes or offers will not be required.  The Government will give every awardee a fair opportunity to be considered for a delivery-order or task-order exceeding $3,00 0 unless an exemption provided in FAR 16.505(b)(2) applies.  PROJECT INFORMATION:  The Medical Repair and Renewal A-E contracts provide all services required to prepare plans, specifications, work plans and other supporting documents necessary for execution of the MRR projects issued by task order.  As part of the d esign effort the contractor may be required to survey the problem areas, evaluate and recommend solutions.  The level of detail and format of the design packages may vary dependent upon the complexity of the MRR project.  A complete design, including a bid schedule, an order of work clause, a construction contractor submittal register, quantity and c ost estimated, MCACES construction cost estimates, a proposed construction schedule, design analyses and calculations, a design document report, an engineering considerations and instructions report, and a draft operations and maintenance manual shall be d eveloped for each project.  In addition to project designs the contractor may be required to conduct studies, investigations, surveying and mapping, tests, evaluations, consultations, comprehensive planning, program management, conceptual designs, value en gineering, construction phase services, soils engineering, drawing reviews, preparation of operating and maintenance manuals, preparation of parametric estimates, equipment and systems commissioning and other related services. Offerors must have specialize d experience and technical competence in medical facility, equipment, and systems design.  In accordance with DFARS clause 252.236-7009, Option for Supervision and Inspection Services, the Government may direct the A-E Contractor to perform any part or all  of the supervision and inspection services for the construction contract.   SELECTION CRITERIA:  The selection criteria for the basic ID/IQ contracts are listed below and are equal in importance (first by major criterion and then by each sub-criterion).  Criteria a-e are primary.  Criteria f is secondary and will only be used as a  tie-breaker among firms that are essentially technically equal.   a.

<DESC>The Pre-Solicitation Notice is REVISED August 10, 2007 per the following:


THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION ONLY ? IN ACCORDANCE WITH  5.101 AND 5.207(c)(14)  The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) intends to negotiate on a SOLE SOURCE basis with Public Health Data Standards Consortium, 624 N. Broadway, Baltimore, MD  21205.  The purpose of this procurement is to further the development of ?Profiles? that guide the adoption of standards that software developers rely on as they create new products that allow health information to pass from application to application, system to system, and setting to setting ? across the healthcare enterprise.  Profiles are based on the functional requirements specifications developed by users (domain experts).  Profiles specify how standards are to be used to address users? needs, eliminating ambiguities, reducing configuration and interfacing costs, and ensuring a higher level of practical interoperability.  For this project, the contractor shall look at a selection of those that are most relevant to public health in its information exchanges with clinical providers in the Wisconsin Department of Health and Family Services (WDHFS).  The selected domains will be explored in WDHFS to create public health focused ?profile? document by using PHDSC?s Functional Requirements Analysis Specification methodology.  The contract will determine whether it is feasible and useful to apply this approach to other public health domains in the context of other states.  An important aspect of feasibility will be to learn how to incorporate patient privacy and security requirements into the electronic exchange of data.  At the end of the project, a manuscript for publication in a peer-reviewed journal will be developed that will summarize the outcomes of the project.

This procurement shall be processed in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions.  The period of performance for this project is twenty four weeks.   In accordance with FAR 13.106-1, a Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition is on file, which states and supports that the Public Health Data Standards Consortium (PHDSC) is the only organization that has an agreement with the WDHFS, and consequently, is the only organization that has access to the clinical providers and the biodirectional data of WDHFS necessary to fulfill the requirements of the procurement..   Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all capability statements received within 15 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Federal Acquisition Service of the General Services Administration (GSA) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to implement a Local Services Acquisition (LSA) for Telecommunications Services.  The Government will award a series of Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contracts, with a base period of three years and four (4) twelve month option periods.  Firm Fixed Price task orders will be issued under the resultant IDIQ contracts.  The Government plans to award multiple LSA contracts in the states of Maryland, Virginia, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Delaware.  These contracts will be for the use of all Federal agencies, authorized Federal contractors, agency-sponsored universities and laboratories and, as authorized by law or regulation, state, local, and tribal Governments, and other organizations.  The Government has defined three service groups: Voice Services (VS), Data Transmission Services (DTS) and Internet Access Services (IAS), along with the labor and material necessary to connect these services to customer premises equipment (CPE).  Offerors must propose mandatory voice services to be eligible for an award.

The Government desires to make multiple awards for LSA services but reserves the right to limit the number of awards.  Contracts will be awarded to Offerors whose proposals are most advantageous to the Government.  The actual number of contracts awarded will be determined by the Government and based on technical acceptability and price evaluation of mandatory LSA services.  The following Technical factors will be considered: Technical Approach, Past Performance, and Management Approach.  The Technical Factors of Technical Approach and Past Performance will be approximately equal in weight and each will be greater in weight than the Management Approach factor.  The combined weight of all technical evaluation factors will be approximately equal to the Price Factor of Total Evaluated Discounted Cost.  Competitive formal source selection procedures will be used as set forth in FAR Part 15.  Offerors are advised that an award may be made without discussion or any contact concerning the proposals received.  The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all offerors; and to award contracts to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total evaluated discounted cost.  Therefore, proposals should be initially submitted on the most favorable terms.

The Request for Proposal (RFP), consisting of the solicitation and all attachments will be issued and posted electronically on the www.fedbizoppps.gov website.  Any questions regarding this synopsis should be directed to Kristin L. Markiewicz, GSA Contract Specialist, at Kristin.Markiewicz@gsa.gov.  This procurement is being conducted under full and open competition on an unrestricted basis under NAICS Code 517110.  The solicitation should be available on or about 07/23/2007.  Potential offerors should be advised that the date of a pre-proposal conference will be announced at the same time as the issuance of the RFP and is estimated to be conducted approximately two weeks after the official RFP is posted.

<DESC>The United States Marine Corps has a requirement to procure contractor support services to provide shallow water and underwater egress training using the Modular Amphibious Egress Trainer (MAET), Submerged Vehicle Egress Trainer (SVET), Helicopter Aircrew Breathing Device (HABD)  and Shallow Water Egress Trainer (SWET). The Government intends to pursue this effort as a full and open commercial competition procurement, Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract with Options pursuant to FAR 2.1, which provides the standard definition of commercial items/services. Standard practices for “Acquisition o Commercial Items”, as set forth at FAR 12.203, will be applied throughout the process. The RFP is expected to be issued on  24 August 2007. Description Program Description: The United States Marine Corps currently has a Water Survival and Underwater Egress Training Program in place at the Marine Corps Base Japan (Okinawa), Marine Corps Base Hawaii (Kaneohe Bay), Camp Pendleton, CA and Camp Lejeune, NC. The MAET is an underwater escape trainer with a generic fuselage section representing specific aircraft/amphibious vessels cockpit and cabin emergency escape exits. The MAET functions closely to the general characteristics of a ditched aircraft; in this case either the CH-46 or CH-53. The fuselage is capable of being lowered into a pool provided by the government. After entry into the water in a horizontal position with the fuselage upright, the fuselage will be capable of rotation about its longitudinal axis. The control unit will provide two-speed rate of descent and retract. The student will be able to practice escaping the trainer with the fuselage floating in an upright position, an inverted position or any position betw!  een upright and inverted. The SVET functions are similar to the MAET, but is used for egress from submerged ground vehicles. The focus of the training curricula is to train passengers aboard water-borne craft and ground vehicles (including helicopters, light armored vehicles, HMMWVs, amphibious vehicles, MV-22 aircraft, as well as emerging platforms and variations of existing ones) to successfully egress the ditched aircraft or vehicle, employ the use of emergency air (IPHABD, SEA-LV2, and variations of these as required), deploy flotation devices necessary to rescue, and utilization of survival equipment and techniques. There are Modular Amphibious Egress Trainers to address egress from aircraft (current configurations include H-53 and H-46) in operation in all sites, except Camp Lejeune, which will be operational in FY08.  Requirement: The contractor will provide the necessary staff and management for the four sites listed in order to deliver instruction of the two-day curriculum leading to certification for utilization of the breathing device (IPHABD, SEA-LV2, and newer versions, as required) and egressing the trainer. This training is in operation at MCB Camp Pendleton, MCB Hawaii and MCB Japan, Okinawa for up to 2,000 students at each site per academic year (48 weeks), plus surge as required. Training currently offered at Camp Lejeune is for shallow water egress training (SWET) and helicopter air breathing device (HABD) until the combat training pool facility is complete and the MAET is installed. Scheduled date is February 2008. Once the facility is complete and the MAET equipment is installed and operational, the contractor will provide the necessary staff and management for the four sites listed in order to deliver instruction of the two-day curriculum leading to certification for utiliz!  ation of the breathing device (IPHABD, SEA-LV2, and newer versions, as required) and egress from the trainer.  The contractor will provide 72-hour maintenance response in Hawaii and Okinawa for the MAET and 48-hour response in Camp Pendleton and Camp Lejeune (when brought on line in CY08). The contractor shall perform annual maintenance on the MAET and its associated equipment (gantry and hoist) at all four sites from January 2008 (February 2008 for Camp LeJeune) and thereafter. The training staff shall be qualified and professionally certified for the work to be performed.  Certifications shall include qualification as either a hospital corpsman or state/nationally certified emergency medical technician. A typical staff shall include a Supervisor/ Instructor, a Primary Instructor, a Device Operator, an IP/HABD (emergency breathing device) Instructor and a Medical Provider. The contractor will be required to provide all dive tanks and associated underwater gear necessary to!   conduct training and provide safety. The government will provide the  facility (pool), tactical gear including rafts, flotation devices, IP/HABDs, etc. necessary for the execution of the curricula. The government will also provide storage, breathing air compressor for tank refueling and will make available locally a decompression chamber in case of an incident. The contractor will be required to screen potential physical disqualifications in accordance with prescribed Navy and USMC orders. Lessons plans, training materials and guidelines shall be provided by the contractor following Government guidelines and shall be updated and modified as the training requirements and platforms evolve. The contractor shall maintain and report all students training data in accordance with the prescribed formats (USMC database) on a monthly basis.  The report is to include cumulative annual utilization information, and  historical data on student throughput and user information. The contractor shall provide maintenance to the IP/HABD and SEA bottles three time!  s per year. The contractor shall provide preventive and remedial maintenance to the training equipment (SWET, MAET (dunker), its panels and components, subsequent modules, dunkers and training system enhancements, training aids, and training equipment as required).  Maintenance personnel shall be professionally qualified and manufacturer certified to perform such work for the dunkers, MAET, SWET, and breathing air devices.  All special tools and spare parts will be provided by the government. Facility space for this activity shall be provided by the Government.  The contractor shall keep an inventory of all maintenance and training equipment, to include spares and repair kits, and provide inventory reports on a monthly basis.

Document review was timely. 2. Provided the community with useful comment. 3. Explanation of document was clear and understandable. 4. Addressed community??s concerns and included them in his/her reviews and comments submitted to Navy.  Each one of the performance indicators would have a different numerical value stemming from their relative importance to the community.  A written comment from the RAB members would complete the form/grid.  This would have a lower numerical value than any of the other, measurable items.  A rating lower than 60 would require community to discuss potential options with the Contracting Officer and the contractor. 

4. The TAPP consultant shall budget to attend two (2) RAB meetings or two (2) meetings with the RAB members to discuss findings of reviewed documents.  This task shall also include the preparation of presentation materials related to the meeting subject matter.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification to Marine Corps Sources Sought and Request for Information notice M00027-07-RFI-0001, dated 23 July 2007, is to delete the reference to NAICS size standard and clarify that the closing date and time for receipt of responses is no later than close of business, 23 October 2007, 4:30 Eastern Time.  The due date for receipt of responses is not extended.  The description is revised to read as follows: 

This is not a solicitation announcement and is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).  No contract will be awarded as a result of the responses received.  The Marine Corps will not reimburse respondents for any costs associated with information submitted in response to this RFI notice.

The purpose of this RFI notice is to determine industry interest and capabilities to provide food services at 53 mess halls located in the continental United States.  Information is requested from industry to assist the USMC in assessing the market of food service providers and identifying contractors interested in submitting a proposal for the Marine Corps planned follow-on Regional Garrison Food Service Contracts (RGFSC).  The Government is not calling for offers at this time; this announcement is an expression of interest only.

The USMC current RGFSC provides food services at 32 mess halls in the eastern United States and 21 mess halls in the western United States.  The mess halls are located at USMC installations in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Arizona, California, and the District of Columbia.  Collectively, the mess halls serve approximately 24 to 27 million meals annually, are open 365 days per year, and provide a wide range of meals, including cafeteria-style meals, fast-food meals, special meals for holidays and celebrations, box lunches and flight-line meals.

The USMC anticipates establishing follow-on, performance-based, fixed-price services contracts to succeed the current RGFSC contracts.  The goals anticipated for the contracts include the following: (1) providing Marines with high quality, highly acceptable, nutritious meals prepared and served in a clean and pleasant environment; (2) providing meals at a fair and reasonable price; and (3) capitalizing on industry efficiencies, innovations, and economies of scale.  A draft RFP and pre-solicitation conference/industry day are tentatively scheduled for the spring of 2008.

Respondents are requested to provide responses to the questions listed below.  Please send your response to John Martin, via email at john.p.martin5@usmc.mil.  Responses are requested no later than close of business on 23 October 2007, 4:30 Eastern Time.  No phone or fax responses will be accepted.  1. Provide the name of your firm, address, telephone, and fax number, web-site URL (if applicable), a point of contact, and an email address.  2. Describe the experience and capabilities of your firm with respect to providing large-scale food services on a regional or national level.  3. Describe whether you are a large or small business concern.  4. Describe the level at which you perform the majority of your contract efforts, e.g., are they at the prime or subcontract level.  5.

Describe or summarize advanced food technology preparation/delivery systems that your company uses, such as sous-vide or cook-chill, that might be applied to this effort.  7. Describe performance objectives that might be applied to this effort to manage and sustain food service quality.  8. Describe contractual terms and conditions that might be incorporated into this effort to accommodate fluctuations in demand for food services as a result of the deployment of personnel, natural disaster, or other unusual or exigent conditions.  9. Provide recommendations for the length of the contract term, pricing spricing structure, and additional award or incentive fees that might be paid for exceeding performance objectives.  10. Provide recommendations for performance metrics, quality control, and food safety measures that can be incorporated into this effort.  11. Provide other contract terms and conditions that might be beneficial to the planned contract.  12. Describe the methods your firm uses to manage occupational safety and provide recommendations for how occupational safety should be incorporated into this effort.  13. Describe the methods used by your firm for employee food service training and provide recommendations for incorporating food service training into the contract.  14. Describe the teaming and subcontracting efforts your firm has engaged in with State Licensing Agencies under the Randolph Sheppard Act, AbilityOne (formerly JWOD) non-profit entities, and small business concerns.  15.

The SIR evaluation process may involve face-to-face negotiations with one or more offerors. The intent of these negotiations is for the FAA evaluators, or IPT, to gain a better understanding of the proposed project and/or to clarify evaluation information submitted by the offeror. All offerors that are eliminated from the competition will be notified in writing. Written responses to this SIR are due by close of business (4:00 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time) on August 31, 2007.

<DESC>The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) is conducting a sources sought synopsis to locate capable organizations providing the services mentioned in the Description and in the paragraphs below. 
A Presidential Initiative to increase health care access in the Nation's most needy communities began in Fiscal Year 2002.  This effort featured the creation of Federally-Qualified Health Center New Access Points and the expansion of capacity at existing Health Center access points.  Early in this initiative, HRSA requested that an evaluation study be carried out to ensure that the needs determination methodology in use by HRSA's Bureau of Primary Health Care (BPHC) as part of the Health Center New Starts and Expansion grant application process was effectively targeting new grant funding to the neediest areas.  The resulting study determined that methods then in place for scoring and comparing the relative needs of different community service areas and population groups could be substantially improved.  As a result, the process used by BPHC for determining the Need For Assistance (NFA) of applicant communities was revised, to (1) reduce the total number of need indicators considered; (2) more carefully define these indicators and the scoring scales or benchmarks to be used with them; and (3) require the use of clearly verifiable data sources in submission of supporting data.   

The Purposes of this Contract are: (1) to update the Access Barrier Scales and Disparities Benchmarks used, within the Need for Assistance (NFA) methodology, for assessing the comparative needs of different communities applying for Health Center New Access Point grants; (2) to update the NFA Data Resource Guide, which is available to Health Center grant applicants through the HRSA-BPHC website, for applicant use in (a) locating available data relevant to the various NFA benchmarks and (b) identifying those data that are specific to their service area and/or population and (c) using these data to fill in the NFA Worksheet which is required as part of New Access Point applications; and (3) to carry out any impact or other analyses needed to make decisions about alternative choices for scales, benchmarks or Data Resource Guide references.

Topics shall include: 1) Update Barrier Scales and Disparities Benchmarks within the NFA Methodology; 2) Update NFA Data Resource Guide: 3) Conduct Relevant Analyses; and 4) Submit Progress Reports and a Final Report.

Interested organizations should submit their capability statements, demonstrating their capability to perform this work, in sufficient detail to assess their ability.   Potential contractors must have an understanding of the purpose of the NFA criteria and their role in the New Access Point grant review process; familiarity with the reasons the NFA criteria were revised, with the revised NFA criteria and worksheet that were developed, and with relevant Federal Register Notices; familiarity with need, demand, access, and health outcomes indicators, especially those used in the NFA criteria; familiarity with the sources of data for these indicators and for health professionals used to provide primary care; familiarity with standards and benchmarks used for these indicators; and familiarity with the HRSA-funded Health Center program (also known as Federally Qualified Health Centers); familiarity with the Data Resource Guide (posted on the BPHC website), the websites referenced therein, and other similar websites that provide relevant data.

Any other specific and pertinent information as pertains to this particular area of procurement that would enhance HRSA's consideration and evaluation of the information submitted should be provided.  The applicable NAICS code for this requirement is 541611 and the corresponding size standard is $6.5M.

Your submission must be received in this office by 11:00 AM on August 20, 2007, by post office mail, email or fax at the following address:  HHS/HRSA;  Attn:  Aileen Broider;  5600 Fishers Lane, Room 13A19;  Rockville, MD 20857;  Tel (301) 443-5231;  Fax (301) 443-5462;  abroider@hrsa.gov.  The capability statements shall be not more than twenty-five (25) pages, on 8.5" x 11" paper, with 1" margins and a 12 point, commonly used font such as, Courier or Times Roman in length.

THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  NO REIMBURSEMENT WILL BE MADE FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT AND ANY FOLLOW-UP INFORMATION REQUESTS.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Global Monitoring Division (GMD) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis a contract under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) with Brechtel Manufacturing Inc., 1789 Addison Way, Hayward, CA 94544-6900 for a chemical analysis instrument capable of measuring the concentration and composition of sea salt particles in Arctic Climate. The instrument must collect atmospheric aerosol particles with diameters from <0.1 to 1.0 micro meters into discrete liquid samples for subsequent analysis.  The sampler must be available for integration on the NOAA WP-3D research aircraft in the spring of 2008. It must be a whole and fully functioning system designed for unattended operation on an aircraft, with unchanging performance at altitudes from sea level to 25,000 feet and which must automatically collect at least 70 samples with a volume of 1 ml or greater before operator intervention is required. The measurement period for each of the 70 samples must be less than 5 minutes and the sampling interval and period must be programmable.
The sole source determination is based on NOAA's market research indicating there are no commercial sources that make instruments for extracting atmospheric aerosols into liquid samples and that meet NOAA's research aircraft requirements.
This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available.  However, firms that believe they can fully meet the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact within 15 days after publication of this synopsis.  Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.

<DESC>Sources are being sought to perform the following (partial)Statement of Work (SOW). Business concerns who are interested in this notice can send the following info: Company name and address, point of contact, DUNS No., and previous contracts info. Send info to: Commander (fcp-4),U S Coast Guard MLCA, Attn: Romy Maglalang, 300 East Main St., Norfolk, VA  23510. Or, by email to: romeo.v.maglalang@uscg.mil; by fax: 757-628-4134/35.

Purpose: Provide SECTOR Houston/Galveston with exposure data and symptom / quality of life data that will be analyzed to identify and determine the statistical significance of short and long term associations or trends that result from working inside the main administrative building.

Associations or trends will include but will not be limited to:
Outdoor and indoor air quality over time.
The concentration ratio of outdoor and indoor airborne chemical contaminants and symptom rates over time
Association between concentration ratios and quality of life indicators over time.
Any combination of the above variables in relation to each other

Study Design: Design will combine environmental and symptom survey data that is temporally matched.  Collection of environmental data will be temporally randomized.  Coast Guard will add airborne chemical environmental data to the study that is event-driven; resulting from sampling when there is a known chemical release or a significant odor is detected which signals a chemical release.

One or more local Houston-area Coast Guard control populations are required; at a minimum the USCG Houston air station at Ellington Field will serve as a control.  A control will allow data comparison and determination if relocation would provide a significantly different working environment.  Control data can be selected from environmental, symptom and/or quality of life indicators.

Data Analysis: Study data will be analyzed by an Epidemiologist or Biostatistician in conjunction with the study team.
  
Sampling: Sampling media and/or instruments will be used to collect a sufficient volume of outdoor and indoor air over a pre-determined period and analyzed by a suitable standard methodology.
Sampling will include at least two indoor and one outdoor area.
Sampling will be of sufficient volume and duration to allow a limit of quantification at least equal to the exposure criteria.
The duration of sampling will match the time-averaging period required by the exposure criteria. 
Sampling will include a suitable number of field and media blanks.
Survey accomplished via the internet or by email.  Questionnaire will collect building occupant symptoms, metadata, and quality of life indicators.
 
Measures: Analysis of at least 30 chemicals by commercial or research laboratory. Chemicals must include: benzene, isopropanol, acetone, xylene, ethylbenzene, toluene, styrene, isobutane, 2-heptanone and total hydrocarbons,pyrene,naphthalene and anthracene as indicators of asphalt-based polyaromatic airborne chemicals.

For a period to include the study duration, gather publicly available National Ambient Air Quality Standards data from the closest NAAQS sampling station to Section Houston-Galveston.
Indoor and outdoor particulate matter concentrations by particle size as measured by Coast Guard owned TSI Dustraks.Particle size discrimination must include PM 2.5.
Indoor and outdoor temperature, relative humidity, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide.

Symptom Survey: building occupants will be assigned an online survey account number and will be asked to provide one-time baseline (metadata) information (name, gender, birth date, tenure, position, physical location, work hours, etc?).

Quality of Life Indicators (QLI): stress, noise, odors, etc.  Building occupants will provide this information in addition to symptoms. Noise levels will be assessed during periods of peak outdoor noise associated with the activities of surrounding industrial areas.
 
Evaluation Criteria: Evaluation criteria will include acute and chronic criteria from:
Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission (TNRCC) health-based Effects Screening Levels, ESL.
ATSDR Minimal Risk Levels (MRLs).
 
Assumptions: The outdoor air sampling location will be fixed, and close as possible to the outdoor air intake to the heating, ventilating and air-conditioning system(s).This location will be considered representative of outdoor air locations, even though concentrations of chemicals in other outdoor areas may actually be lower or higher than measured values.

Indoor air sampling locations will be of a number such that they are representative of distinct areas of the building. For example, distinct floors or separate built environments within the building that house distinct populations of individuals.  These locations will be considered representative of indoor concentrations of chemicals at those locations.

<DESC>This is a sources sought notice and not a request for quotations.     The purpose of this announcement is to determine potential qualified Small Businesses who can furnish and deliver the service listed below.    


1.	GENERAL INFORMATION
Objective
The Denali Commission seeks a Contractor to provide consulting, training and advisory services for the development of high performance investment strategies for Denali Commission?s grant program areas. This requirement entails staff training in areas related to: determination of strategies to maximize the public?s investment in projects; selection of effective projects to fund; measurement of critical factors of impact; identification of project risk and use of best practices; and communication of program and project evaluation.
Background of Agency
The Denali Commission
In 1998, national attention was focused on the infrastructure and economic challenges faced by rural Alaska communities with the passage of the Denali Commission Act. The Act was signed into law on October 21, 1998 becoming Title III of Public Law 105-277, 42 USC 3121.

The Commission is an innovative federal-state partnership designed to provide critical utilities, infrastructure and support for economic development in Alaska by delivering federal services in the most cost-effective manner possible. With the creation of the Commission, Congress acknowledged the need for increased inter-agency cooperation in addressing the unique infrastructure and economic challenges faced by America?s most remote communities.

The Denali Commission Act of 1998, as amended (Division C, Title III, PL 105-277) states that the purposes of the Denali Commission are:

To deliver the services of the Federal Government in the most cost-effective manner practicable by reducing administrative overhead costs.

To provide job training and other economic development services in rural communities, particularly distressed communities (many of which have a rate of unemployment that exceed 50%).

To promote rural development and provide power generation and transmission facilities, modern communication systems, bulk fuel storage tanks, water and sewer systems, and other infrastructure needs.
 
The Denali Commission includes seven Commissioners: a Federal Co-Chair appointed by the Secretary of Commerce, a State Co-Chair who is the Governor of Alaska, and five additional members representing statewide, non-governmental organizations. The Commission is staffed by a small number of employees, augmented by additional personnel from partner organizations. The Commission relies upon a special network of federal, state, local, tribal and other organizations to successfully advance its mission.

The Commission will partner with tribal, federal, state and local governments and collaborate with all Alaskans to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of government services, to develop a well-trained labor force employed in a diversified and sustainable economy, and to build and ensure the operation and maintenance of Alaska?s basic infrastructure.

There are approximately 1,400 projects statewide.  A few of the programs that the Commission is currently involved in are: Energy, Health Care Facilities, Economic Development, and Training.  

Geography, climate and distance are the momentous issues faced by those who live in Alaska.  These combine to produce tremendous obstacles, especially for people who live in small rural communities here.  

The varied geography of Alaska is challenging ? 17 of the 20 tallest mountains in North America, glaciers, and vast wilderness present barriers to communication and transportation. Tundra wetlands and permanently frozen soil in the central and northern regions of the State require special engineering considerations for constructing building foundations and utilities.  

The harsh climate of Alaska requires that construction practices used in the rest of the United States be rethought and reengineered at significant cost, and construction materials must be modified to withstand Arctic wind, weather and temperature.  Rivers that represent the only mode of transport for construction goods to many Alaskan communities freeze and are impassable for more than half the year, making logistics complex.  Construction of infrastructure projects here is expensive, and the harsh climate makes engineering difficult.

Alaska is equivalent to one-fifth the size of the 48 lower contiguous states, and stretches 2,800 miles east-to-west and 1,400 miles north-to-south.  With only a few communities scattered across the State connected by roads, the rest of the roughly 250 communities in Alaska rely upon aircraft, watercraft, and snowmobiles (as weather permits) to transport goods.

Alaska is striving to reach the same level of infrastructure enjoyed by the rest of the country, so that communities here can achieve sustainability.  A lack of roads, boardwalks or docks; limited safe water sources; varying degrees of sanitation facilities; and deficient or inaccessible health care are critical gaps that keep communities from achieving their goals.  

Denali Commission?s mission is to improve the infrastructure in Alaska to help individuals contribute to the sustainability of the communities in which they live.  For nine years, the Commission has awarded federal grant funds to projects throughout the State with these goals in mind.  Over 1,400 projects have been funded, and the results are tangible:
?	85 Bulk fuel tank farms have been renovated or constructed, and communities have safe and adequate storage of fuel.
?	85 Health clinics have been built and another 92 are in process, encouraging cooperation at the community, sub-regional, and regional levels, so that preventive and primary health care is made accessible to all residents of those regions.
?	More than 3,000 individuals have been trained in vocational and career skills valuable to the State?s development.
?	Several washeterias, multi-use, and domestic violence facilities have also been constructed to help communities ensure that sanitation, family support, and safety are offered to everyone in that village.

The goal to improve infrastructure is complicated by the length of time that most village sites have been inhabited, and the depth of connectedness residents have to the locale.  Cultural norms and practical matters must be considered and respectfully addressed in the proposal for any modernization efforts. For example:
?	Would the seemingly positive prospect of indoor plumbing be overshadowed by the complex considerations of prohibitive monthly cost and inconvenient protection of the pipes from the elements?
?	Is a new clinic or multi-use facility too large for the community to support economically?

<DESC>This is a sources sought notice to assist NIST in completing market research for a procurement that will be initiated in the near future.  No solicitation is currently available, and no unsolicited proposals will be entertained as a result of this sources sought notice.  

Background:

The Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) program at the U.S. Department of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg, Maryland is a nationwide network of resources transforming manufacturers to compete globally, supporting greater supply chain integration, and providing access to technology for improved productivity.  MEP centers work directly with small manufacturers to provide expertise and services tailored to their most critical needs, which range from process improvements and worker training to business practices and applications of new technology.  Solutions are offered through a combination of direct assistance from center staff and outside consultants.  The MEP system of centers and field offices in all fifty states and Puerto Rico is funded by federal, state, local and private resources to provide these services to manufacturers.

The Program Development Office of MEP is researching, developing and testing new technology transfer and technology transition methodologies, which will be utilized to implement new service offerings delivered through, and in partnership with, the national network of MEP Centers to small and medium size manufacturers.  The goal of this effort is to implement new processes for improving the rate of success of technology transfer from Federal research laboratories and research universities, new methods for transitioning those technologies into new process applications and efficiently produced products by small manufacturers, and new mechanisms for connecting identified technology needs of small manufacturers to technology sources that can provide solutions to those needs.

Information that NIST Seeks:

NIST seeks information from potential sources with experience and current expertise in the following areas: 1) Identifying technologies within Federal research laboratories and research universities with commercial potential; 2) The translation of those technologies into product concepts and new process applications with projected market potential; 3) Innovative mechanisms for connecting those new technology based opportunities with small manufacturers; 4) Mechanisms for systemically identifying the technology needs of small manufacturers (both individual and aggregated); 5) Connecting those identified needs to technology sources that can provide solutions to those technology based needs; 6) Knowledge of manufacturing extension programs and their relationships to state and Federal technology transfer and commercialization programs; and 7) integrating and managing the infrastructure required to achieve more effective connectivity between the technology needs of small manufacturers and new technology sources.

<DESC>The Government is seeking professional design services from an architect-engineering (A/E) firm.  The A/E will provide guidance and investigative services to improve the methods of care delivery within the Pittsburgh Healthcare System.  The A/E will review information provided by the VA, but not limited to CARES data, population demographics, penetration rates, productivity measures, current health care delivery systems, patient demographics, physical structures, strategic and operational plan etc. The contractor will provide guidance with an internal effort at updating the current strategic plan in reviewing the types of services offered and providing recommendations and advice in improving service delivery and spatial changes necessary to meet strategic and tactical plans.  Such guidance and updating of the strategic plan will be focused on a detailed analysis of care/service delivery in a planned future two-site model utilizing the UD and HJH facilities.  A secondary component of the study will be to develop preliminary framework for a revised five-year construction plan.  The five-year construction plan shall include station level, NRM and Minor projects.  Projects shall include cost estimates for design and construction.  NRM projects shall include a breakdown of minor improvement, NRM, BSER (Building Service Equipment Replacement), and BSEA (Building Service Equipment Additional) costs broken down by category.  The construction plan will take into account maintenance projects to maintain utilities in order to provide appropriate healthcare. 	The plan is required to have four sections: 1. Your current space allocations per the space criteria (SEPS-II Software) 2. Your 10-year horizon space needs based on VA projections of workload  3.  Logistical schedule of moves and temporary space requirements  4.  Listing of projects needed to accomplish the plan within projected funding allocations.  The primary purpose of the review is to recommend improvements in health care service delivery based on necessity, appropriate size and optimal location within the two-site system for each of the clinical and administrative services.  Changes in capital asset use may include modifying the physical layout of health care and administrative services, consolidation of excess space with cost savings achieved and identification of each project required to further integrate services to a single seamless system.  Changes in strategy will be based in part on the standardized VA population databases through year 2012.  Population and demographic comparative statistics for each service will be provided using the CARES Space and Functional Assessment data, CARES workload data and any supplemented data by the contractor.  A/E shall be allowed to rely on the accuracy and completeness of information requested.  AutoCAD files will be reasonably complete and accurate but A/E will make minor revisions as necessary. All designs shall be accomplished in accordance with VA guidelines and specifications, which are available on the Internet at http://www.va.gov/facmgt/standard.  A/E will coordinate visits with the Project Manager.  A/E must be proficient in the use of Auto Cad 2007 and have access to Microsoft Word 5.0 or higher.  Area of consideration is restricted to within sixty (60) miles of the VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System, University Drive Division, Pittsburgh, PA 15240.  Those interested firms, both small and large, within the area of consideration shall submit three (3) copies of current SF 330 to the attention of Pamela Rayburg, Contracting Officer, 04A1-H, VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System, 7180 Highland Drive, Pittsburgh, PA 15206.

<SUBJECT>70 -- Metis Software Maintenance
<DESC>The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) intends to award a sole-source purchase order for Troux Metis products and support in the amount of $60,774.48 utilizing simplified acquisition procedures to Computas NA, Inc., 2721 226th Ave SE, Sammamish, WA 98075-9531. This is in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 only one responsible source. NO RFP will be issued as a result.
The USPTO has current investment in the Metis tool from Troux to manage the USPTO Enterprise Architecture assets and framework; therefore, it is critical for the USPTO to renew the existing maintenance support agreements.  In addition, the USPTO needs to acquire the new Metis licenses to perform a software version upgrade.

<SUBJECT>Implementation of Voluntary Commiments to Reduce Industrial Energy Intensity; DOE ITP Program
<DESC>Request For Information DE-PS36-07GO37005 Program Manager / Area: Douglas Kaempf, Program Manager, Industrial Technologies Program Information Requested on: Implementation of Voluntary Commitments to Reduce Industrial Energy Intensity, under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct), Public Law 109-58, Section 106 Description: Section 106 of EPAct authorizes the Secretary of Energy to enter into voluntary agreements with industry with the goal of reducing energy intensity by not less than 2.5 percent each year during the period of calendar years 2007 through 2016. The Department of Energy (DOE) is seeking information from industry and industry associations regarding the most beneficial and efficient way to reduce industrial energy intensity in order to implement this goal. The information received will be used by DOE for internal planning and decision making purposes. The Industrial Technologies Program (ITP) under the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) has a history of partnering with the Industrial Sector to improve the energy and carbon intensity of manufacturing equipment, processes, and final products while improving the competitiveness of this critical sector of the U.S. economy. The Industrial Technologies Program is leading the Departmentâ€™s efforts to help industry achieve even greater control of the energy inputs to produce the items needed by our nation every day. DOE and ITP encourage the broadest involvement and participation in this effort from across the Industrial Sector. DOE and ITP are especially focused on the high energy consumption and rapid growth industries but welcome all corporations and individual facilities wishing to make a difference to respond to this call. Request for Information Guidelines: DOE will not pay for information provided under this Request for Information (RFI), and there is no guarantee that an ITP project will be supported as a result of this RFI. This RFI is not accepting applications for financial assistance or financial incentives. You are encouraged to carefully read the entire text of EPAct Section 106 prior to responding to this RFI (see Attachment #1). The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is solely to solicit input for DOE consideration in determining the most beneficial and efficient way to implement Section 106 of EPAct, which has the goal of reducing industrial energy intensity 25% by 2017. Comments in response to this RFI should be submitted in Microsoft Word or PDF to ITP@go.doe.gov by 8:00 PM Eastern Standard Time on September 18, 2007. Please provide responses to this RFI using the attached template (see Attachment #2). An editable Word Version of this template can be downloaded from the IIPS Special Notice site for this RFI under File Attachments. Questions relative to responding to this RFI may be sent to this same mailbox in advance of your response, and will be answered via the mailbox only. Rationale or Justification: Industry accounts for about 30% of overall energy demand in the United States. Numerous opportunities exist to enhance the efficient use of energy in the Industrial Sector. EPAct Section 106 authorizes the Secretary of Energy to â€œenter into voluntary agreements with one or more persons in Industrial Sectors that consume significant quantities of primary energy for each unit of physical output to reduce the energy intensity of the production activities of the persons.â€ The voluntary agreements shall have as a goal the reduction of energy intensity by not less than 2.5 percent each year during the period of calendar years 2007 through 2016. Under this authority, the Secretary of Energy, in cooperation with other appropriate Federal agencies, will develop mechanisms to recognize and publicize the achievements of participants in voluntary agreements. A person that enters into an agreement under this section and continues to make a good faith effort to achieve the energy efficiency goals specified in the agreement shall be eligible to receive from the Secretary a grant or technical assistance, as appropriate, to assist in the achievement of those goals. Section 106 of EPAct provides some guidance on the purpose, eligibility, timing, and limitations for establishing voluntary agreements. However, it does not define a specific process for administration of such a program, nor does it appropriate funds for such a program at this time. DOE would appreciate input from industry, industry associations, and other entities regarding the most beneficial and efficient ways to reduce industrial energy intensity in order to implement Section 106 of EPAct. Information on the overall level of interest by respondents in participating in the planning of this program; possible incentives needed to encourage the immediate adoption of best-in-kind energy efficient technologies or practices at your facility or across your corporation; recommendations for technology development or other support needed to achieve this goal; and other factors, critical for meeting this goal, that should be considered to ensure strong industry participation are requested. Please consider the list of topics below in your response. You may also wish to consider issues that you believe are relevant to reducing industrial energy intensity. â€¢ Experience or lessons learned from energy management activities. â€¢ Challenges, pitfalls (what not to do) learned from these activities. â€¢ Roadblocks and concerns that industry may have with reducing energy intensity by 2.5% per year. â€¢ How essential is reducing energy consumption to your companyâ€™s economic competitiveness. â€¢ The most effective way(s) to motivate industry to participate in this initiative, including possible incentives. â€¢ The most effective way to conduct a federal government supported program to reduce industrial energy intensity. â€¢ How to document and verify the industrial energy savings in order to evaluate the success of these voluntary agreements. â€¢ The level of interest in participating in the planning or in partnering with the Department to achieve this goal. â€¢ The need for national and/or international standards on industrial energy management. â€¢ Specific technical, technology, or plant assessment tool support considered critical for your participation and the achievement of the initiativeâ€™s stated goal. In summary, please provide comments to aid and inform DOE in the creation of voluntary agreements to reduce industrial energy intensity. The Department thanks you for your assistance and input.

<SUBJECT>37 -- Solicitation of interest to participate in an EPA pilot project to test technology for reducing the spray drift of pesticides
<DESC>EPA is seeking vendors of pesticide application technology to participate in a pilot project to validate protocols for testing the effectiveness of technology for reducing pesticide spray drift (drift reduction technology or DRT). EPA will conduct this pilot project using Agency funds. The pilot project will lead to an industry-funded Environmental Technology Verification (ETV) project, conducted with EPA, to verify pesticide DRTs. The goal of the DRT verification project is to identify and verify technology that pesticide applicators can use to reduce pesticide spray drift. DRT technologies could reduce risks posed by off-target spray drift to humans and the environment. A description of the pesticide DRT verification project is available on EPA's website at http://www.epa.gov/etv/este/html  

 Specifically, EPA is seeking drift-reduction application equipment and drift-reduction adjuvant chemicals that can be used with ground-boom or aerial equipment for spraying pesticides onto row or field crops and that can be tested in either a low- or high-speed wind tunnel.  

EPA drafted test protocols for evaluating DRTs and, consistent with ETV policy, shared it with a stakeholder technical panel for review and comment. You may request a copy of the protocols from the contacts identified in this notice.     

EPA will select two ground application technologies (one nozzle and one adjuvant)for validating the protocol for the low-speed wind tunnel test and two aerial application technologies (one nozzle and one adjuvant)for validating the protocol for the high-speed wind tunnel test. The purpose of this pilot project is to validate test protocols rather than evaluate the drift-reduction potential of a particular nozzle or adjuvant or adjuvant-nozzle combination.  

Vendors who are interested in participating in this pilot project should submit offers in writing or by e-mail in which they describe their DRT technology and explain how the technology meets all of the following selection criteria:
1)       Expectation of effectiveness, as shown by data or scientific principles;
2)       Likelihood of consumer acceptance based on ease of use or cost; and
3)       Likely magnitude of use based on its possible use on major crops or possible market penetration.     

Vendors should send their offers to:  
Michael Kosusko, ETV/ESTE DRT Project Manager; 
kosusko.mike@epa.gov; 
919-541-2734; 
Fax: 919-541-0359.

EPA will notify vendors of the selected technologies within 30 days of the response date specified in this notice.  EPA expects to conduct the protocol validation tests by January 2007 and release the final protocol in April 2008.  When EPA issues its report of this pilot project, it will identify the technologies used to validate the test protocol.     
  
After the test protocols have been validated, EPA will notify vendors of pesticide application equipment of the opportunity to participate voluntarily in an industry-funded Environmental Technology Verification (ETV) program conducted with EPA. Please see EPA's website at http://www.epa.gov/etv/ for a description of the ETV program. The purpose of the ETV program is to verify the risk-reduction potential of the tested technologies. EPA included DRTs in the ETV program because they have the potential to reduce pesticide risks to humans and the environment by reducing non-target spray drift.

<SUBJECT>R -- SOLE SOURCE ANNOUNCEMENT -  ANNUAL SURVEY OF FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FINANCES
<DESC>Under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation, Part 6, Subparts 6.301 and 6.302, the U.S. Census Bureau intends to contract with April Rodda to provide expert advice and assistance required by the Governments Division to complete the resurrection of the Annual Survey of Federal Government Finances. 

The purpose of this contract is to obtain the services of April Rodda to provide expert advice and assistance required by the Governments Division (GOVS) to complete the resurrection of the Annual Survey of Federal Government Finances (Federal Comp).  This includes the research, data collection, compilation, classification, data review, and written analysis of financial data for the federal government.  

Ms. Rodda is uniquely qualified to provide the necessary expertise that this contract stipulates.  She served as an analyst on the Annual Survey of State and Local Government Finances conducted by the US Census Bureau's Government Division from July 2004 to August 2007.  During her time of employment with the Bureau Ms. Rodda has been an extremely capable analyst and the resident expert on the classification of government financial statistics.  In addition, Ms. Rodda is already extremely well versed in the historic documentation for the Federal Government Finances, or Federal Comp, from the last time Governments Division conducted the survey.  Ms. Rodda has been a vital part in the State Government Finance Survey with the development and expansion of the E-Basic system, which we will use to conduct the compilation and analysis of the Federal Comp.  Without Ms. Rodda it will be nearly impossible for PFAB-B to complete the work on the Federal Comp as no other analysts have the particular combination of expertise in government finance classification, background knowledge of the Federal Comp, and expertise in the E-Basic system.  

Inquires about this announcement may be addressed to Mr. Albert Kennedy at Telephone #301/763-4420, or through email address albert.ernest.kennedy@census.gov.

Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the government.

The USAID Haiti Mission requires the services of a highly qualified polling firm to conduct seven (7) public opinion polls in Haiti over the next four (4) years. The purpose of these statistically significant polls is to assess the trends of many socio-economic and political data; to gather information on specific events or programs that receive USAID or U.S. Government assistance (such as national and local elections); to provide a better understanding of whether USAID is reaching its target populations and target geographic areas; to facilitate USAID?s understanding of local perceptions and knowledge of U.S. Government assistance in Haiti; and to help USAID track program performance indicators. 

Background:  
The poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, Haiti has been plagued by political violence for most of its history. After an armed rebellion led to the departure of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in February 2004, an interim government took office to organize new elections under the auspices of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH). Continued violence and technical delays prompted repeated postponements, but Haiti finally did inaugurate a democratically elected president and parliament in May of 2006.  The government of President Ren? Pr?val is faced with a daunting challenge to modernize the state, undertake needed fiscal and governance reforms, re-establish security and re-launch the economy.  In July 2006, Haiti held a successful donors conference in which the international donor community pledged $750 million to support the government?s development priorities.    

According to the CIA World Fact Book, Haiti has an estimated 8.7 million residents.  The country has 10 Administrative Departments and 140 Communes for decentralized administrative purposes.  80% of the Haitian population lives under the poverty line and 54% live in abject poverty. Two-thirds of all Haitians depend on the agriculture sector, mainly small-scale subsistence farming, and remain vulnerable to damage from frequent natural disasters, exacerbated by the country's widespread deforestation. A macroeconomic program developed in 2005 with the help of the International Monetary Fund helped the economy grow 1.8% in 2006, the highest growth rate since 1999. 

Since 1999, USAID/Haiti has conducted opinion polls to measure Haitian citizens? beliefs and perceptions on various political and socio-economic topics related to civil rights and responsibilities, government performance, electoral participation and political parties.   

Description of Services:
The contractor shall provide seven nation-wide statistically significant public opinion polls that include a representative sampling of the Haitian people.  The polls will be conducted in Creole.  Data from these polls must be disaggregated by gender (male/female) and geographic location of the respondents by Department and Commune.  There are 10 Departments and 140 Communes.  The polls will be completed according to the following delivery schedule, in consultation with USAID?s CTO and in accordance with actual events in Haiti (e.g., elections).

Statement of Work 
Border Enforcement and Other Grants Program Administration
1.	INTRODUCTION
a.	Background
This requirement is to provide technical and administrative services to support the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), Office of Safety Programs?? efforts to develop grant administration and tracking procedures and resolve funding discrepancies that exist within the Fiscal Management Information System (FMIS) and DELPHI system.  The activities encompassed within this procurement are intended to ensure effective and consistent administration of the Border Enforcement Grant program and other FMCSA grant programs including the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program (MCSAP) and the Commercial Driver??s License Program (CDL)

When operating in the United States, Mexican and Canadian carriers, drivers, and vehicles are required to comply with all Federal and State safety and operating regulations. These regulations include operating authority, insurance, and other requirements of the FMCSA. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) within the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) has the primary responsibility for ensuring compliance.  To effectively meet its responsibilities, the FMCSA has been working in concert with the States to improve commercial motor vehicle safety and ensure foreign carriers, drivers, and vehicles that enter and operate in the United States comply with U.S. commercial motor vehicle, driver and carrier safety requirements.

	The North America Borders Division within FMCSA is responsible for administering grants being made available to Border States to expand and sustain commercial vehicle inspection and other compliance activities in preparation for full implementation of the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) truck access provisions.  The State Programs Division administers the MCSAP and the Commercial Drivers License Division administers the CDL.

	b.	Legislative Authority
                                                
The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) was established as an administration of the Department of Transportation under authority of P.L. 106-159 (MCSIA), Section 101, ??Establishment of Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration.?? The authority to award a contract and obligate funds for this requirement is contained in the Motor Carrier Safety Reauthorization Act of 2005 (H.R. 4818, PL 108-447).  The Act amends Chapter 313 of title 49, United States Code (U.S.C.) by inserting section 31313. Grants for commercial driver??s license program improvements.  Paragraph 31313(b) High Priority Activities specifies that ??The Secretary may make a grant to a State agency, local government, or other person for 100 percent of the costs of research, development, demonstration projects, public education, and other special activities and projects relating to commercial driver licensing and motor vehicle safety that are of benefit to all jurisdictions of the United States or are designed to address national safety concerns and circumstances.??  

Authorization to use MCSAP Administrative Takedown funds for this purpose is contained in 49 U.S.C. 31104(e) Deduction for Administrative Expenses, which provides that the Secretary may deduct, from the funds made available each fiscal year, not more than 1.25 percent of those amounts for expenses incurred in the administration of MCSAP.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has a requirement for the following services: Detailing Advertising Expenditure Data: 1.   Scope-The Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) Bureau of Economics requires detailing advertising expenditure data in order to perform its study evaluating how advertisements affect medical care use in the United States. Detailing advertisements are the advertisements made by prescription pharmaceutical firms that are targeted at medical professionals. Detailing advertising data consists of the following promotion measures: the number and type of contacts, the cost of contacts, the retail value of samples (RVOS), and the cost of professional advertising.Proposal submission-The FTC will evaluate proposals on a lowest cost technically acceptable basis.Scope of Services: Detailing-Detailing advertisement data needs to be provided on a monthly basis over the period 1996-2004 at a product level for the U.S. A product represents a firm-molecule-strength-quantity-administration form combination. The detailing information must be provided separately for specific drug molecules and time periods. Detailing advertising data consists of the following promotion measures: the number and type of contacts, the cost of contacts, the retail value of samples (RVOS), and the cost of professional advertising.  Contacts are defined as interactions with doctors by pharmaceutical representatives, and include full discussions with doctors, drug fairs attended by pharmacy directors, delivery of product samples, and other types of contacts with doctors. The cost of contacts represents the dollar amount spent by a drug firm for a contact. RVOS represents the retail value of free drug samples directed to office-based physicians. The cost of professional advertising represents the total cost of advertising in medical journals. The FTC requests advertising data for two drug categories: anti-hypertensive medications, and analgesics.  Both the analgesic and anti-hypertensive drug classes represent several sub-classes of drugs. Analgesics include anti-migraine medications, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, narcotics, Cox-2 inhibitors, and analgesic combinations. Anti-hypertensive medications include ACE inhibitors, ACE II anti-hypertensives, adrenergic blocking agents, beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, diuretics, anti-hypertensive combination therapies, and other anti-hypertensive medications. Products should be uniquely identified with either an 11-digit National Drug Code (NDC) or a combination of six fields that list the generic name, strength quantity, strength unit, quantity, firm, and administration form of the drug.  (i.e.  FTC requires information sufficient to determine the total detailing advertising expenditures made by a manufacturer (Merck) for its drug (Rofecoxib marketed as Vioxx) in a specific month (June of 2000)).  All data must be delivered to the agency in Excel, SAS data files, or delimited ASCII files on CD or DVD.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has a requirement for the following services: Direct to Consumer Advertising: 1.   Scope  The Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) Bureau of Economics requires direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising expenditure data in order to perform studies evaluating how advertisements affect medical care use in the United States. DTC advertisements are the advertisements made by prescription pharmaceutical firms that are targeted at consumers. Proposal submission-The FTC will evaluate proposals on a lowest cost technically acceptable basis.Scope of Services:Direct to Consumer Advertising-The DTC advertisement data needs to be provided separately by product, for each month and U.S. census region (or some finer geographical unit), over the period 1996-2004. A product represents at least a drug name, and may include other details such as firm, administration form, and quantity unit. Census regions refer to the nine census regions (New England, Mid-Atlantic, East North Central, West North Central, South Atlantic, East South Central, West South Central, Mountain, Pacific) or some finer geographical unit (such as the metropolitan statistical areas (MSA) contained in the U.S. census region). DTC advertising expenditures include those expenditures paid to television, radio, newspaper, magazine, and outdoor media firms. The FTC requests advertising data for two drug categories: anti-hypertensive medications, and analgesics.  Both the analgesic and anti-hypertensive drug classes represent several sub-classes of drugs. Analgesics include anti-migraine medications, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, narcotics, Cox-2 inhibitors, and analgesic combinations. Anti-hypertensive medications include ACE inhibitors, ACE II anti-hypertensives, adrenergic blocking agents, beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, diuretics, anti-hypertensive combination therapies, and other anti-hypertensive medications. A product represents a firm and drug name combination. Products should be uniquely identified with either a National Drug Code (NDC), a field identifying the drug name, or a combination of fields that identify the drug name and other product information. For example, we require information sufficient to determine: the total DTC advertising expenditures made by a manufacturer (Merck) for its drug (Rofecoxib marketed as Vioxx) in a specific month (June of 2000) in a specific region (New England). All data must be delivered to the agency in Excel, SAS data files, or delimited ASCII files on CD or DVD. If the vendor wishes to propose an alternate data delivery they must list the delivery options in their proposal.The molecules requested are listed in the attached appendix.
Period of Performance-The Contractor shall schedule and complete all work required by this task order within 30 days after receipt of order.Project Manager/Point of Contact  The Contractor shall designate one employee as the Project Manager (PM) for all work performed under this contract.  The PM shall be designated as key and shall be responsible for all work performed under this task order.  The PM shall be a single point of contact for the Contracting Officer.

Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)?
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held?
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

(End of provision)

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

STATEMENT OF WORK

Scope:

The USU Anatomical Gift Program allows civilians the opportunity to donate their body to USU for teaching and research purposes.  When a call is received informing the University that someone who is a designated donor has passed away, the contractor must ascertain the name, address and telephone number of the deceased and have the body transported from the place where death occurs, or where remains are located, to USU.  Once teaching/research has been completed, the remains will need to be transported to the crematory for cremation, and returned to USU for final disposition.  Cremated remains must be incased in a polyethylene urn.

Death Call services include receiving after hour calls notifying USU of a donor?s death, obtainment of vital statistics and other relevant information (i.e. condition of the body, donor?s next of kin, certificate of death (COD)).  The contractor shall contact USU on the next duty day informing them of the death call donor.  USU will provide the Death Call phone number and the contractor will maintain that number until the contract expires.    

All removals (Anatomical Gift Program/Death Call) must be accompanied with appropriate documentation ? death certificate, burial-transit permit, and other approvals as required (i.e., medical examiner?s stamp).

All transfers from the MSAB must be accompanied with appropriate documentation (i.e., release).

***This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-18.***

*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 333995 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. This requirement is a 100 percent small business set-aside.***

***The National Institute of Standards and Technology is seeking to purchase One (1) Cylinder for a positive displacement flow metering standard with options for additional components.

****All interested Contractor?s shall provide a quote for the following:

Line Item 0001: Quantity One (1) Cylinder, which shall meet or exceed the following specifications:

Note: All referenced ?Figures? shall be provided upon request from the Contract Specialist.

A piston/cylinder set is required as major components of a NIST positive displacement flow standard. The purpose of this flow standard is to calibrate flow meters over the flow range of approximately 5 to 80 gallons/minute. A conceptual schematic showing the major components of the flow standard, Figure 1, can be provided upon request. 

The main system components are (1) the cylinder, with heat exchanger shroud, and the piston, (2) the piston actuator shown at the right (reference Figure 1) of the cylinder, and (3) the stroke measurement components mounted on the second shaft tube that is connected to the piston on the left (reference Figure 1). This system is to operate with bidirectional piston travel along the length of the cylinder. The piston is driven by a ball-screw/nut actuator mechanism supplied to NIST separately from this requirement.

Cylinder Specifications:

Diameter: 14.000 plus or minus 0.002 inches along entire length
ID Surface Roughness	: 8 RMS or better
Bore straightness: plus or minus 0.002 inches over its length
Inner bore length: 72 inches

The cylinder must be of stainless steel or steel tube or pipe having a wall thickness sufficient to maintain structural integrity of the inner bore within the specified diameter tolerance.  

FOR ADDITIONAL SPECIFICATIONS AND CONCEPTUAL DRAWINGS, PLEASE CONTACT THE CONTRACT SPECIALIST, ANDREA PAREKH, AT ANDREA.PAREKH@NIST.GOV.

OPTION LINE ITEMS:  The following line items are Option Line Items.  The Contractor shall provide pricing for these items.  The prices quoted for Option Line Items 0002 and 0003 shall remain effective for a period of one year from the date of award. 

Option Line Item 0002: Quantity One (1) Piston Assembly, which shall meet or exceed the following specifications: 

NIST requests the expertise of the vendor community in the design and implementation of the dynamic seals between the piston and cylinder (defined under line item 0001). A conceptual multi-piece piston assembly, Figure 4, can be provided upon request from the Contract Specialist.  Seal material must be compatible with MIL-C-7024C calibration fluid which has physical and chemical properties very similar to certain jet fuels, Stoddard Solvent, and some kerosenes.  Quoters are required to submit a description of their technical approach which addresses how this requirement will be completed.  In addition, a technical feasibility statement must be provided. See the Technical Capability section below for details.

Not shown in the concept is a seal leakage provision. Piston sealing is expected to consist of two physically separated seals. The separation area at the piston rim provides the opportunity to incorporate such a detection system through the use of radial holes in the piston leading to a collection point near the center of the piston. Piston designs that use a singe connecting rod are acceptable, but must contain provision for seal leakage detection. 

Option Line Item 0003: Quantity One (1) Cap Flange, which shall meet or exceed the following specifications: 

The cap flanges shall provide the following functions: 

1) Alignment of the flange centerline with that of the cylinder centerline via the dowel pin hole pattern of the cylinder end flanges 

2)  Alignment of the actuator centerline with that of the cylinder centerline via half-inch dowel pin holes located in the hole pattern at the center of the flange. See the attached drawings. 

3)	Entry and exit of Type II calibration from the connection manifold via the J518 hole patterns specified in the drawings. These comply with the SAE 4-bolt hydraulic flange specification J518 CODE 61 for the 1.5-inch size 

4)	Sealing of the actuator tube against leakage of Type II calibration fluid. The actuator tube is 3.000 inches in diameter and is chrome plated with a surface finish of 8 micro-inches or better. 

ADDITIONAL SPECIFICATIONS AND DRAWINGS CAN BE PROVIDED UPON REQUEST FROM THE CONTRACT SPECIALIST, ANDREA. PAREKH, AT ANDREA.PAREKH@NIST.GOV. 

***The Contractor shall state the warranty coverage provided for the instrumentation..***

***Delivery shall be provided not later than 5 months after receipt of an order and installation shall be no later than 30 days after delivery.  Delivery shall be FOB Destination. FOB Destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery. The contractor shall deliver all line items to NIST, Building 301, Shipping and Receiving, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-1640. ***

<DESC>Synopsis of SECHQ1-07-R-0173 for IV&V Services

Scope. The Contractor shall provide the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with Independent Validation and Verification (IV&V) Services in support of projects sponsored by the SEC Office of Information Technology (OIT) including the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) system.  In addition, the Contractor shall create a delivery tracking system and prepare existing EDGAR deliverables for archiving.  All work shall be performed under task orders issued against the award.
Background
OIT projects support the SEC mission of protecting investors, maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitating capital formation.  This award covers IV&V testing for a subset of such projects and includes IV&V testing for the EDGAR system, one of the largest projects.  EDGAR performs automated collection, validation, indexing, acceptance, and forwarding of submissions by companies and others who are required by law to file forms with the SEC. Its primary purpose is to increase the efficiency and fairness of the securities market for the benefit of investors, corporations, and the economy by accelerating the receipt, acceptance, dissemination, and analysis of time-sensitive corporate information filed with the agency.  The majority of the other OIT projects that will need IV&V services are financial in nature or are designated as being critical to the mission of the SEC.
IV&V activities under this award cover both testing activities and evaluation of project deliverables such as the program/project management plans, quality assurance plans, configuration management plans, requirement traceability matrices, and software design documents.

<SOLNBR>HQ0013-07-T-0003
<RESPDATE>082107
<ARCHDATE>08292007
<CONTACT>Janet Szatmary, Contract Specialist, Phone 703-601-3728, Fax null, Email Janet.Szatmary@dsca.mil
<DESC>1. The purpose of this Amendment is to provide a listing of the questions submitted to DSCA Contracting in response to solicitation HQ0013-07-T-0003 along with their responses.  

Question 1: Wanted to confirm that the use of a government credit card is optional for purchases under $3000.00. 

Answer 1: Paragraph 8.a. of the solicitation states: "Calls that fall under the Government Purchase Card (GPC) limit (currently $3,000), may be paid using a DIILS GPC as long as the contractor accepts credit card payments." 

Question 2: Does the monthly invoice only refer to unpaid work?

Answer 2: IAW FAR13.303-3(a)(6)(i), the summary invoice is to include "all deliveries made during a billing period, identifying the delivery tickets covered therein, stating their total dollar value, and supported by receipt copies of the delivery tickets".  "All deliveries" includes both paid and unpaid deliveries for the billing period in question.

Question 3: For the PowerPoint slides, you ask that we include the English text in a text box in the lower right hand corner.  At least one of the slides has a great deal of text that would make including both languages on one slide a bit difficult without some serious re-design of the slide.  My question is, do you have any specific guidelines for how the English text should appear, or should we use our own discretion?  
It will be difficult to format the translated slides to appear identical to the English slides if we have to also include the English text.  

Answer 3: The English is put in a 12-14 point font to enable it to fit.  If there is a slide where everything will not fit, an abbreviated English portion can be used.  Main purpose of this is to allow the English speaker to be assured of what slide he is speaking about,

Question 4: ?The PowerPoint slides should have the English words in a text box to the lower right of the slide that match the translated words." Please elaborate on this requirement. In order to preserve the formatting, should the English words be included in the notes section below the slide or on the actual slide? If on the actual slide, how much of the English text should be provided (for example, just the title, the title and key words, or all of the text)? Would completely ?bilingual? slides (line-by-line) be acceptable?

Answer 4:  The purpose of English translation on the slide is so that the speaker can be assured of the contents that have been translated; therefore preference is not to put in notes section.  Participants is seminars often want to learn more English, so having the English on the slide helps the audience as well.  Side by side slides might be acceptable.  DIILS would have to base that decision on the product that comes out of such work.  We have used the requirement for English to be available in a textbox in a smaller font successfully for a number of years. 

Question 5: Will a list of preferred or previously used terminology or reference documents be provided? If so, will the information be provided as hardcopies or electronic files? Will translation memories be available?

Answer 5:  DIILS can provide previous translations, but we do not have a glossary of terminology that has been translated.
 
Question 6: Will a secured FTP site be required as a possible means of transmitting documents?

Answer 6:  No, our Internet security does not allow downloads from ftp sites.

Question 7: Will this contract be awarded to only one company or several? 

Answer 7:  It is the Government's intention to select a single awardee. The awardee will be selected in accordance with the source selection criteria noted in 52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) of the Clauses section. 

Question 8: Will we have to provide price quotes after award of the BPA? 

Answer 8:  In accordance with the source selection criteria noted in 52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) of the Clauses section, 
Price is one of the 3 evaluation factors that will be evaluated for award. Pricing should be included with Technical Proposal. The pricing should be submitted in accordance with the CLIN structure identified under Paragraph 9. Note the number was omitted but the applicable section (between paragraphs 8. and 10.) begin with "The contract line items are: CLIN 0001 AA-BC/ FFP ? per word translated for the languages identified."
 
Question 9: Will we only receive fully editable and unlocked MS Word and Power Point documents? 

Answer 9:  As noted under Paragraph 2, "Occasional translation from hard copy documents may be required, but in most cases materials are available in Word or PowerPoint electronically." Please also see Question/Answer 11 below.

Question 10: Is there a possibility that we will receive different types of documents besides MS Word and PowerPoint? 

Answer 10:  Yes, there is always this possibility.

Question 11: Are the samples provided representative of the type of formatting that will be required? 

Answer 11: Yes.
 
Question 12: What approximate yearly volume (in number of English Words) do you expect for this contract?  

Answer 12: Based on past year, an estimate would be 300,000 words.  However, please keep in mind this is only an estimate.  Needs fluctuate year to year depending on program demand. 

Question 13: Are there any languages that are particularly high volume or is the work spread fairly evenly throughout all the languages listed in the solicitation? 

Answer 13:  Spanish, French, Arabic, and Russian are most requested.

Question 14: Is it possible to receive separate High Resolution copies of the graphics used in the documents during the execution of the contract?  For example, there is a cartoon in the first page of the Power Point slide that has to be Photo shopped so that the translated version will match the original.  It will look much better if we have high-resolution files rather than converting them from embedded Power Point pictures.  

Answer 14:  Items that are in jpegs do not need to be translated.  The speaker would refer to the illustration and an interpreter would explain anything that needs to be explained.  

Question 15:  ?Solicitation HQ0013-07-T-0003 is a 100% set aside for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business." Our company is only Veteran-Owned. Does this mean that only service-disabled veteran-owned businesses may apply? If so, may companies that do not meet this requirement still participate as subcontractors or partners of these companies?

Answer 15: Yes, this requirement is set-aside for award to a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB). Therefore, you must be a SDVOSB to be considered for award.  Yes, companies may participate as subcontractors or partners of these companies as long as they are adhering to the Policy of the Small Business Administration for "Limitation of Subcontracting" (see CFR 125.6).

Question 16:  What word counts are anticipated for the documents to be translated? If a current estimate is not available, what has been the volume in previous years?

 Answer 16:  See Answer 12 above.

Question 17:  "Translations will accurately reflect...any regional dialects/differences in a country?s language.? For which regions should the samples be translated for Spanish & French? For example, French from France, Africa, Canada, or the Caribbean; and Spanish from Spain, Mexico, Argentina, Cuba, Central or South America, OR the Caribbean? 

Answer 17: Translation delivery orders state the language and the country that the translation is for.  For the purpose of the translation, Spanish will be for South America and French for Africa.

Question 18: Could you please clarify which dialects will be needed for the following languages on your list:  Arabic, Armenian (Eastern or Western), French, Mongolian (Chahar or Khalkha), Portuguese, and Spanish.

Answer 18:
Arabic - Iraqi

Answer 20:  An estimated number of words is 300,000 (see also Answers 12 and 16 above).  Number of pages is difficult to determine, as the page can be full of words or just have a few words on it (such as on a PowerPoint slide).

Question 21:  The two files to be translated and submitted as samples were provided in PDF format. Is it possible to obtain these files in the original MS Word & PowerPoint formats, or to at least obtain the graphics for the PowerPoint document?

Answer 21:  Requests for sample documents in their original format should be submitted by email to janet.szatmary@dsca.mil.   

Question 22: Can you please provide me with estimated labor hours for this contract?

Answer 22:  The applicable pricing structure for this effort is $ per word. This is not a time and material/labor hour contract. Therefore, the requested information is not applicable nor is it available. Please refer to Questions/Answers 12, 16, and 20 above.

Question 23:  Is this a follow-on? If this opportunity is a recompete, could you provide high-level information on the incumbent contract (contractor's name, contract number, award date, estimated max value)?

PART II PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT FOR TEXTUAL RECORDS DIGITIZATION ENVIRONMENT
1.0  INTRODUCTION The objective of this Performance Work Statement (PWS) is to obtain all equipment and labor necessary to procure operational new workstations that will provide an expanded capability for the digitization/scanning of textual records at Archives II in College Park Maryland.  The workstations include maintenance of the workstations for a base year described in this statement of work, along with industry standard warranties for the equipment.  Existing work stations as described below will also be required to integrate with the new workstations. 
Statement of Need, Background and Objectives.
The Special Media Preservation Laboratory (NWTS) of Preservation Programs (NWT) of the National Archives and Records Administration needs to expand capabilities for the digitization/scanning of textual records. Currently, the Microfilm Camera Lab of the Special Media Preservation Laboratory operates sixteen (16) traditional planetary-style 35mm microfilm cameras. We anticipate replacing these microfilm cameras with new digital camera systems with indexing software to be used for digitizing a variety of original records. The NWTS labs operate two microfilm scanners (an older roll-film scanner and a newer microfiche scanner) and need to expand microfilm scanning capabilities. Also, the labs use several high-speed document scanners. All these systems need to be integrated into an environment for digitizing and indexing textual records using a software application for workflow management and document indexing.
The existing Special Media Preservation (NWTS) Environment
The NWTS Labs are creating a local area network (LAN) which is comprised of lab equipment (scanners, digital cameras, printers, audio and video capture and playback devices) and the computers used to host the applications that run these devices, as well as the digital storage systems to hold the digital output and servers that manage this entire array of devices.
Each lab (audio and video, still photo/digital imaging/aerial/cartographic, motion picture, microfilm camera, and microfilm duplication) has workstations used to capture and prepare digital output from the reformatting devices. The digital resources are saved to a local network attached storage (NAS) server (typically 6 TB to 7 TB of RAID-5 storage with tape back-up and an uninterruptible power supply) that is dedicated to each lab for short-term storage. Digital resources saved to the NAS servers are backed up daily to LTO tapes by project, and copies of the tapes are transferred to protected storage for the duration of the project. Quality control checks are made by technicians during the course of a project and at its completion.  Once approved, the project resources (digital files and related metadata) will be transferred to a centralized storage area network (SAN) managed by NARA?s IT department. Daily LTO backups are made of data stored on the SAN.
Due to the necessity of choosing workstations and operating systems based upon lab equipment and application needs, servers running Active Directory (Microsoft) and Open Directory (Apple Computing) are used simultaneously to manage the lab network environment. Managed Gigabit switches are used at the workgroup level to provide adequate network throughput between the workstations and local network attachable storage, as well as part of LAN security. Fiber based switches are used to connect the workgroup switches and network attachable storage, as well as providing a link to the centralized SAN.
All the equipment procured for the textual records digitization environment will be integrated into the NWTS lab environment. Other existing equipment to be used in this environment include: Zeutschel OS 10000TT book scanner; Fujitsu fi-4750c document scanner; Kodak i620 and i1320 document scanners; Sunrise Proscan 2000 microfilm scanner; Wicks & Wilson FS300 microfiche scanner; Various photograph digitizing workstations; Workstations for existing equipment are various Windows based computers.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO THE COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFP FOR MACHINING STUDY OF PM SUPERALLOYS IN SUPPORT OF SUBSONIC ROTARY WING PROGRAM.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to: Answer questions received before the August 10th Question Submittal Deadline.   The due date for receipt of offers is not extended and remains 5:00 pm EST Friday, August 24th, 2007. -The following are the paraphrased questions and corresponding answers: ADMINISTRATIVE QUESTIONS Q1: What is the anticipated start date of the contract? A1: As referenced on page 24 of the solicitation, Offerors shall utilize October 1, 2007 as the estimated contract start date Q2: Is this solicitation restricted to small businesses? A2: The solicitation is not restricted to small businesses.  However, small businesses may receive the applicable price evaluation adjustments listed on page 7 of the solicitation.  Q3: Will NASA consider responses for 'Other Than Firm Fixed Price' contract types? A3: Due to the comparatively low procurement value, offers for 'Other Than Firm Fixed Price' contracts are highly discouraged.  Offers submitted with 'Other Than Firm Fixed Price' contract types will still be evaluated.	However, the alternate contract type will be noted during the evaluation process and may impact selection.   TECHNICAL QUESTIONS Q4: Can previously created broached disk alloy samples be provided in Phase I?  A4: NASA would need to know the exact composition and processing of the Phase I alloy.  NASA will favor Phase I alloys similar in composition to NASA LSHR, in order to minimize risks of dissimilar machining responses between the two alloys.  In both Phase I and Phase II, all microstructural, residual stress, and cold work data generated on NASA alloy LSHR will be publishable in open literature.      Q5: If ITAR controlled material and design are provided, will NASA be willing to handle it accordingly?  A5: The directive from the NASA Aeronautic program is to make available for open publication as much of NASA's funded work as possible. Because of this directive, we would prefer to minimize ITAR content of the work. Since it is NASA's intent to openly publish most of the LSHR work to be produced under this RFP, the ITAR content should be kept to a minimum. Q6: Is the microstructure of the LSHR pancakes uniform and will they be heat treated?	 A6: Yes, they would be supplied after powder metallurgy consolidation, extrusion, isothermal forging, solution and aging heat treatments to give a uniform microstructure, with normal solution quench cooling rate effects on precipitate microstructure/properties as functions of depth from the quenched surfaces. Q7: How big is the LSHR pancake that NASA will supply?	  A7: At least 6 inch diameter width, and 1.5" thick.  Q8: Can NASA GRC provide the blank test specimen shapes from the LSHR pancakes?   A8: The contractor would be responsible for removing the blanks from the NASA pancakes, according to mutually agreed drawings.	  Q9: Will test specimens have to be cut from specific areas in the LSHR pancake?  A9: The entire pancake can be used for specimen removal. The location and orientation of each specimen blank within each pancake will need to be tracked. Since cooling rates within the pancake can be an important variable, NASA and the Offeror will agree upon the specimen layout prior to specimen blanking. Q10: Do you have any guidelines on the minimum amount of fatigue testing for Phase I? A10: The previously given answer with respect to the Offeror structuring the Phase I testing to comply with NASA SOW applies. Q11: Damaged/distorted surface layers from broaching can vary significantly.  How much should the extent of formation of the damaged layer vary?  Typical production rejection levels or more severe damage?  A11: Levels will be chosen by NASA after consultations with the contractor. Q12: Are there drawings for the samples to be produced? A12: The selected Offeror and NASA will coordinate on potential sample configurations, and NASA will make the selection. Q13: Can TEM characterization be fitted into the budget? A13:  NASA will not be doing TEM characterization.  Q14: One of the deliverables at the end of Phase I is ‘One fractured half of each fatigue tested broach sample of OEM alloy’.  How many samples do you anticipate?  A14: This depends on how the Offeror decides to structure the proposal and how they propose to utilize the available resources within the schedule constraints. The governing criteria for the Offeror should be the following sentence taken from the SOW (Section II Technical Approach): ‘In order to examine the effect of these variables on the mean fatigue life, a limited number of low cycle fatigue tests will be performed using a configured specimen geometry selected by the Offeror in consultation with NASA.’ Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on July 19th, 2007. Documents related to this procurement are available over the Internet.  These documents reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.

<DESC>Below are questions from potential offerors and associated answers.  Several potential offerors requested the same information and the list below reflects a compilation of those questions and answers.  

Please note that the offer due date and time are being extended to allow any necessary revision to offers based on the information below.  The new due date and time are: AUGUST 15, 2007 AT 12 NOON.  If you have already submitted a proposal and would like to revise it based on the information below, you may due so.  Please indicate that this it is a revised proposal in your email or fax.  All other terms and conditions of the combined synopsis remain the same.  

Questions from Vendors:
1.  Can the 30 mile range limit be waived or increased to approximately 40 miles? 
 	No ? the 30 mile range limit cannot be increased.  

2.  If the mileage range cannot be waived or increased, can the installations take place on-site at Quantico?  
If the selected vendor requires space to perform and complete the emergency equipment installations and can provide all needed supplies, tools, and equipment for the installations, CIRG would be able to provide space protected from outside elements.  No automotive lifts, tools, supplies, equipment or manpower would be provided by CIRG.  CIRG, (Federal Government), would not be held liable for any injury on or to and from the space provided.

3.  The grill LED requirement states a '4" LED'.  Can a 'Star 3.75 inch LED' (generally considered to be a superior grill light) be substituted?  If not, please advise which manufacturer was used to determine the requirement.  
Yes,  the  4 ? LED grill light can be substituted for an LED grill light within a quarter inch of specified specs, no less than or greater than a quarter inch and the light must maintain normal rectangular grill light specifications. 

4.  The 90 watt power supply description referenced only two strobe tubes to be installed in the headlights.  Most current emergency equipment installs require at least two in the front and two in the rear.  Please confirm this requirement.
Only two front strobes installed at this time.  The strobes are being utilized for alternate head light flashing, without interfering with the automobile?s normal lighting systems. 

5.  If the FBI only requires two strobe tubes, then a two position power-supply would be more cost effective.  If more bulbs are to be added in the future, the 90 watt power supply is best, but if the requirement is for only two bulbs, can a two-position power-supply be substituted (50 watts)? 
No, the 90 watt power supply is needed for future usage.


6.  Please list the make, model, and year of vehicles that equipment is to be installed on.
Most vehicles will be either 2007 or 2008 model year.  Chevy, Ford or Dodge makes. Models include Blazer, Tahoe, Suburban, Colorado PU, Silverado PU, Durango, Crown Vic and possible a few specialty vehicles. 

7.  The siren requirement mentions "Remote Capability" and "Microphone Controlled".  Is this to be a voice activated siren?  And, is the siren to be a hand-held siren?  Please more clearly define this requirement.
The requirement refers to the location of the siren package, which needs to be out of normal visual area from out side of vehicle.  The remote capabilities refers to remote located switches, like under dash mounted or mounted in dash, which includes siren, whelp, phaser and air horn switches.  The microphone must be mounted within reach of the driver. The microphone controlled is for the public address function of the siren.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number for this acquisition is RFQ93622 and is being issued as a Request for Quote.  The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-18.  This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541519. The purpose of this Contract is to purchase replacement servers and software for the Soft System which is the Laboratory Information System. The mission of the Department of Clinical Research Informatics (DCRI) is to guide the appropriate use of information technology to enhance clinical research, patient care, and hospital management.  DCRI is responsible for the infrastructure that supports the technology for all mainframe, client-server, desktop computers and its accompanying application management/development, database information.   DCRI provides technical advice and supports the NIH/CC and the new Clinical Research Center (CRC) through the operations, development and management of administrative and business software applications while supporting as many as 4,500 users. DCRI supports the Laboratory Information System (LIS) which is made up of several modules from Soft Computer some of the modules include SoftLab, SoftBank, SoftMic, and SoftPath. The LIS system supports the functions of the CC Laboratory, Blood Bank, and Pathology departments. Clinical Orders are entered in Eclipsys Sunrise Clinical Manager (SCM) and are HL7 interfaced to LIS and results from LIS are interfaced back into SCM. This system must be operational 24x7x365 as its providing a fundamental process for clinical care. 
 
The objective of this Statement of Work (SOW) is to obtain hardware, software, an implementation services to upgrade the existing Soft Computer modules from DB Vista to the Oracle based database version. In addition, the current hardware supporting LIS has reached end of life (EOL) and requires replacement.

SPECIFIC TASKS
Task Area 1 ? Hardware

Please provide a quotation for the hardware and licenses listed in Attachment 1. Please submit quote using the provided spreadsheet format.

Task Area 2 ? Hardware Integration

Please provide a quotation for the hardware prep work, installation, system configuration. Please include estimated travel expenses.  

Task Area 3 ? Oracle Database Conversion 

Please provide a quotation for the tasks listed below: email amcgee@cc.nih.gov for attachment

Initial database installation and setup
Engineers will install and configure DBMS software and database to provide for both uninterrupted 24x7 database service and top database performance. Particular database deployment depends on the client's hardware configuration, business needs and installed applications. Engineers will also create and configure standby or replicated databases for dual systems configurations, setup database backup, configure automatic database maintenance and performance gathering scripts and perform initial database performance tuning.

Database upgrades
From time to time, database management software and underlying database needs to be upgraded to resolve critical bugs or because previous DBMS version becomes de-supported (Expected lifetime of database software is currently 2 to 3 years). Database upgrade is often required as well when application code is upgraded to support new functionality. 
Engineers must have all the necessary knowledge to perform database upgrades for db_VISTA (RDM), ORACLE database engines and they will make sure that the database version transition goes fast and smooth.

Ongoing database maintenance
Create and prepare the database(s) for test or upgrade system, load or unload data to/from the database, initialize database in full or only certain areas (i.e. patient data only).

Database monitoring
Database monitoring can detect problems before they become critical, identify performance bottlenecks and warn about possible inconsistencies in the database, system or software. 

Problem determination and resolution
Databases may fail or experience errors due to a number of reasons, including power fluctuations, system crash, hardware failures, bug in a software or a user error. Problem determination and resolution, thus, requires the person to be the expert in a number of fields, including system administration and engineering, database administration and LIS software. 
Critical performance problems ("deadlocks", "lock ups", or "very slow system" events) can often be resolved "on the fly" to minimize client's downtime and adverse effects of slowdown.

Database backup, recovery and failover.
It is essential that patient data is protected and recoverable should the disaster strike. Engineers will create and set up backup configuration, adjusted to our hardware architecture and requirements. 
Database backups monitoring and verification is a cooperative effort between engineers and the client, DCRI will check their database backup daily and report any failures to engineers  to make sure database is continuously recoverable.
Although backups are normally performed as automatic or semi-automatic jobs, recovery is a complex process, which requires significant knowledge of database engine and is usually a manual process, performed by domain expert.
For dual systems configurations, database operations can be fail overed to the auxiliary system, if the primary system fails.
Database administrators are trained and certified in database backup and recovery and database failover.
Database performance tuning

Performance of applications depends to a large degree on a performance of the database. Properly configured and tuned database can increase database through output and reduce average wait times several times, compared to an untuned one on the same hardware. Engineers will collect and analyze database performance statistics over representative time period and perform necessary adjustments to database(s), based on the current workload, underlying system configuration and business needs. 
Conduct periodic workload analysis and adjustments are necessary to make sure database is running on peak efficiency.


Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) Government Furnished Information:

The government will provide the contractor with the necessary facilities to support task completion, including desktop computers, software and network services.

The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this RFQ to a responsible offeror using the lowest price technically acceptable process.  Quotes shall be evaluated for acceptability only and shall not be rated.  Award will be based on the lowest evaluated price of quotes meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for the non-cost factors.  The following non-cost factors shall be used to evaluate quotes:  Factor 1 ? Technical capability of the products offered to meet the Government?s requirement and Factor 2 ? Past Performance.  Factor 1 shall be evaluated on a ?go/no go? basis.  If a quote has been determined to be a ?go? on Factor 1, then Factor 2 will be evaluated to determine if the offeror?s past performance history is satisfactory.  An offeror who has submitted a technically acceptable quote and who has been found to have a satisfactory past performance history will then have its quote evaluated for the lowest price.
Factor 1 ? Technical capability of the products offered to meet the Government?s requirement
The minimum criteria for acceptability for this factor shall be the submission of descriptive literature that clearly indicates what the offeror is proposing and will be providing all products in accordance with the stated characteristics in the Scope of Work (SOW).  ?Descriptive literature? means information (e.g., cuts, illustrations, drawings and brochures) that is submitted as part of a quote.  Descriptive literature is required to establish, for the purpose of evaluation and award, details of the product offered meet the specifications in the SOW.  The information is required to determine the technical acceptability of the offered product.  Failure to submit descriptive literature or failure of descriptive literature to show that the product offered conforms to the requirements of this solicitation may result in the rejection of the offer.  
                                              
Factor 2 ? Past Performance
By past performance, the Government means the offeror?s record of conforming to the solicitation specifications and to standards of good workmanship; the offeror?s adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the offeror?s reputation for record of reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally the offeror?s business-like concern for the interest of the customer.  Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based on consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.  It will not be based on absolute standards of acceptable performance.  The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely deliveries.  Offerors who have submitted a technically acceptable quote will be given an opportunity to address any unfavorable reports of past performance.  In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.

Offerors must submit a completed copy of FAR 52.212-3 OFFEROR REPRESENTATIONS AND CERTIFICATIONS-COMMERCIAL ITEMS with the price offer, or may complete the representations and certifications on the internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  Failure to include the certifications along with a price proposal will render an offeror ineligible for award.   All questions and inquiries should be addressed via email to the Contract Specialist POC, daniel.herring@dla.mil, Request for Quote Number SP3100-7127-3136.  Prices, representations/certifications, descriptive literature, and past performance information must be received NLT 4:00 PM EDT on August 27, 2007.  This information should be submitted to the above email address or faxed to 717-770-7591.  Contractors must be capable of accepting payment by either electronic funds transfer or government credit card for this procurement.  ALL SOURCES MUST BE REGISTERED IN THE CENTRAL CONTRACT REGISTRATION DATABASE, http://www.ccr.gov/, or an award cannot be processed.
