Govworks intends to  issue a contract.  BACKGROUND:  The Department of  State is committed to the creation of the United  States Diplomacy Center (USDC) within the Department  of State building with both private and public  funds.  The Center will bring American diplomacy and  its practitioners to life for the public as it  explores the history, function and challenges of  diplomacy.  With interactive exhibits, briefing  space, multimedia stations and cutting edge  technologies and techniques, the Center will engage  visitors in understanding how diplomacy affects all  our lives and how ordinary citizens, as well as  professionals, contribute to its formulation and  execution. To fulfill this vision, the Department is  providing renovated space, staff and security for  the new Center.  Space has been allocated for the  Diplomacy Center next to the 21st street entrance.   Museum designer Ralph Appelbaum is designing the  interior of the Diplomacy Center. The Department of  State will need to raise funds from private donors,  possibly as much as $60 million, to build the  Center.  An additional amount will be needed to  provide the Center with an endowment for maintaining  and replacing exhibits and carrying out special  projects and programs.  The Department needs to know  the scope and feasibility of launching a capital  campaign.  SCOPE OF WORK:  The Department seeks to  contract with a development firm to prepare and  conduct a study to determine the scope and  feasibility of launching a capital campaign to build  the U.S. Diplomacy Center.  The study would result  in a comprehensive report of findings, analyses and  recommendations.

<DESC>Kaiser-Hill Company, LLC, the Integrated Management Contractor at the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE), Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site (RFETS), in Golden, Colorado has been working steadily towards Site Closure through the demolition and decontamination (D&D) of buildings.  These D & D activities now include the requirement for an Analytical Services Support Contractor (ASSC).    

The Analytical Services Support scope of work  consists of four (4) major activities:  Technical Support, Analytical Sampling and Shipping, On-Site Gamma Spectroscopy  and Data Assessment.

The Analytical Services Support Contractor will be managed by the Kaiser-Hill Analytical Services Division (ASD), which provides cradle-to-grave support to the RFETS Project Managers (PMs) for all RFETS sampling and analytical needs. The primary activities performed by ASD include sample planning and consultation; initiating sample paperwork and sample tracking; sampling and sample shipment; laboratory procurement and coordination; data receipt, examination, verification, and validation; data problem resolution; hard copy and electronic data management; laboratory performance assessment; release of usable data to PMs; and data archival/maintenance.  ASD is also responsible for processing and approving laboratory invoices, as well as conducting laboratory audits. During Fiscal Year 2001, ASD managed these activities for over 150,000 individual analyses.

The specific requirements for each work element are as follows:

Technical Support:
The technical support activity requires an onsite staff with a collective technical knowledge in the areas of organics, inorganics, wet chemistry, radiochemistry, and sampling methods to support seven Site Closure Projects in obtaining quality analytical data that meet applicable EPA and CDPHE regulations.  The technical staff shall be responsible for scheduling sample collection and coordinating sample analyses through Kaiser-Hill's Analytical Services Division (ASD).  Responsibilities shall also include technical review of sampling and analysis plans, development of analytical statements of work, development of data assessment guidelines, preliminary data review, technical consultation, and sample process flow coordination between Site Closure Projects and the Kaiser-Hill Analytical Services Division.

The Subcontractor must have or can obtain (prior to contract period of performance) a core technical staff with a minimum of a BA/BS degree or 8 years equivalent experience in a science discipline with laboratory experience and knowledge that collectively covers the following areas: Technical writing, Alpha Spectrometry, Gamma Spectrometry, Gas Proportional Counting, Liquid Scintillation, Kinetic Phosphorimetry, VOC, SVOC, Pesticides, PCBs, Herbicides, Dioxins/Furans, Metals, Wet Chemistry, TCLP, Microbiology, NIOSH/OSHA and Sampling Methods. 

 

Analytical Sampling and Shipping:
The analytical sampling and shipping portion utilizes  industry-standard sampling practices to collect samples for laboratory analyses.  Types of sampling include surface water, ground water, and waste characterization that require pre-sampling activities (pre-evaluation, walk down and sample preparation); the collection of samples for laboratory analyses, sample labeling and packaging, transfer and/or shipment of samples to on-site or off-site laboratories, data entry, printing of labels, review and QC of documents and preparation of shipping documents.  All sampling and shipping activities must comply with all Site requirements, pertinent regulatory statutes, DOE orders, and building specific regulations.  


The Subcontractor shall demonstrate that they have or can obtain personnel with experience and knowledge in sampling and shipping of radioactive and hazardous material using DOT and IATA regulations. 


On-Site Gamma Spectroscopy:
The onsite gamma spectroscopy requires the following: identification and qualification of gamma-emitting radionuclides using High Purity Germanium Detectors (HPGe) and commercially available spectral acquisition and processing software.  This effort will include the use of both standard detectors (fixed geometry) and newer "In-Situ" Object Counting Systems (ISOCS) type detectors.   Measurements will be required on single or multiple plastic or glass jars of varying volumes, plastic bags containing irregularly shaped objects, and/or various sized plastic or glass bottles with liquids.  Field measurements may be required for large rectangular wooden objects (waste crates), small or large metal tanks and drums of various sizes, in addition to other irregularly shaped objects. The following sample matrices can be expected:  filter media (glass or paper), water, oil, solvents, soil, granular activated charcoal, sludge, wood, asphalt, concrete, drywall, metals to including stainless steel, lead shielding or lead containing materials, depleted uranium and enriched uranium.  

The Subcontractor will also be required to count samples for DOT shipping purposes; specific nuclides (e.g., AM-241, U-235, U-238, Cs-137 and others); and perform general screening for gamma ray emitting radinuclides.  

On-site gamma spectroscopy is currently being performed for RFETS by Canberra Industries, Inc.  Kaiser-Hill intends to assign this subcontract to the successful offeror. The Subcontractor shall demonstrate that they have or can obtain an individual with sufficient knowledge of gamma spectrometry theory and practice, data interpretation, etc., to properly manage this Subcontract.

Data Assessment:

Subcontractor shall provide data assessment services to evaluate the quality of analytical data produced in support of the seven Site Closure Projects.  Data assessment shall be performed on data packages generated, at a minimum, from the following analytical areas:  Alpha Spectrometry, Tritium, Gross Alpha and Gross Beta, Radiometric Strontium, Total Uranium by KPA, Radium, Gamma Spectrometry, Bioassay, Volatile Organics, Semivolatile Organics, PCB/Pesticides, Dioxins/Furans, Herbicides, Metals, and Wet Chemistry Methods.  Data shall be assessed to pre-existing data assessment guidelines that address data quality and contract compliance requirements.  Additional areas of assessment may be added as needs arise.  Data assessment will include both a rigorous data evaluation termed Validation and a cursory evaluation identified as Verification.  Data verification shall be performed at the Contractor's facility (estimated to be 3 people).  Data assessment services also include writing and distributing data assessment reports, writing non-conformance notices, and uploading data qualifiers to database repositories.  The technical staff assigned to data assessment services shall have a minimum of a BA/BS degree in a science discipline with laboratory experience or 8 eight years equivalent experience in a science discipline with laboratory experience in applicable analytical areas.

The U.S. Department of Interior's GovWorks, on behalf of the U.S. Department of State, is soliciting proposals to identify a contractor to investigate the dimensions and feasibility of private sector leadership and financial support for the Department of State's proposed Museum - the United States Diplomacy Center.  Govworks intends to issue a contract. BACKGROUND:  The Department of State is committed to the creation of the United States Diplomacy Center (USDC) within the Department of State building with both private and public funds.  The Center will bring American diplomacy and its practitioners to life for the public as it explores the history, function and challenges of diplomacy.  With interactive exhibits, briefing space, multimedia stations and cutting edge technologies and techniques, the Center will engage visitors in understanding how diplomacy affects all our lives and how ordinary citizens, as well as professionals, contribute to its formulation and execution. To fulfill this vision, the Department is providing renovated space, staff and security for the new Center.  Space has been allocated for the Diplomacy Center next to the 21st street entrance.  Museum designer Ralph Appelbaum is designing the interior of the Diplomacy Center. The Department of State will need to raise funds from private donors, possibly as much as $60 million, to build the Center.  An additional amount will be needed to provide the Center with an endowment for maintaining and replacing exhibits and carrying out special projects and programs.  The Department needs to know the scope and feasibility of launching a capital campaign.  SCOPE OF WORK:  The Department seeks to contract with a development firm to prepare and conduct a study to determine the scope and feasibility of launching a capital campaign to build the U.S. Diplomacy Center.

<DESC>Provide labor and material to perform the following work aboard USNS Mercy:

1. Replace the Leslie valve controls for the following systems using Yokogawa controllers similar to the ones installed on the recently updated feed pump controls:
Hot well (Recirc) valve
DC heater make up valve
Spill valve 
2. Overhaul as necessary the actual Leslie valves to insure proper operation of the new controls.  
3. These systems are absolutely necessary to the safe operation of the vessel steam propulsion plant.  Failure of these valves to reliably maintain the condenser water level can NOW lead to main feed pump catastrophic failure.  The feed pumps rely on the condensate pumps to provide cooling water for the mechanical seals.  Failure to maintain sufficient condensate level in the main condenser can cause the condensate pump to lose suction and interrupt cooling water flow to the feed pump seals.

<DESC>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), operated by Battelle Memorial Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology.   License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research agreement or CRADA program.  The Technology:  Sorbent and functionalized polymers play a key role in a diverse set of fields, including chemical sensors, separation membranes, solid phase extraction techniques, and chromatography.  Sorbent polymers are critical to a number of sensor array or electronic nose systems.  The responses of the sensors in the array give rise to patterns that can be used to distinguish one compound from another, provided that a sufficiently diverse set of sensing materials is present in the array.  This new technology uses hydrosilylation as the bond-forming reaction to develop a versatile and efficient approach to developing sorbent polymers with diverse interactive properties for sensor applications.  In this fashion, both the chemical and physical properties of these polymers are predictable and tunable by design.  In addition, polymer formulations have been prepared that can be photopatterned into localized domains on surfaces.  This hydrosilylation chemistry offers tremendous versatility in the development of sorbent and functionalized polymers and thin films.  Diverse sets of polymers can be prepared with control over chemical and physical properties of the resulting materials.  The chemistry can be further utilized in the crosslinking, grafting, and patterning of thin films.  The materials can be adapted to a variety of sensor types.  These types of materials and films are useful or potentially useful for chemical sensors, sensor arrays, membranes, solid phase extraction, chromatography, and lab-on-a-chip applications.  Patent pending.  Details have been published:  Carbosiloxane polymers for sensors, J.W. Grate et al., Chemical Innovation, November 2000, Vol. 30, 29-37.  Note:   THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.   Any company interested in licensing this technology must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by e-mail) no later than 30 days from the publication date of this Notice summarizing the company's business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.   Companies deemed appropriate will be provided with further information on the technology.  Such information may require an executed Nondisclosure Agreement.  Respondents wishing to enter into negotiations for a commercial license will be required to submit a business plan for the commercialization of the technology prior to licensee(s) selection and negotiations.  Please send letters of interest to the attention of the POC identified within this Notice.

<DESC>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), operated by Battelle Memorial Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology.   License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research agreement or CRADA program.  The Technology:  This is a method of producing combined inorganic-organic coatings using solutions-based electrochemistry.  This novel process forms the polymer directly at the surface of an electrically conductive substrate via a one step electrochemical process based on the generation of reactive anionic radicals of a quinone type in the vicinity of an electrode surface, followed by cathodically coupling the reactive intermediates with a halogenated inorganic heterocycle (typically a trimer, tetramer or octamer precursor).  Starting from these simple cyclic precursors, many different types of thin polymer films having a controlled three-dimensional morphological structure readily can be prepared.  Variable chemical composition can be engineered into the film microstructure.  The unique microstructure, in combination with the wide range of possible physical and chemical properties makes these films of technological importance as conductive or insulating coatings or as free standing materials for membrane or sensor applications.  The material resulting from the process exhibits high thermal, chemical, and radiation stability compared to membranes that are solely organic.  The new technology offers a number of advantages in application, including the ability to coat complex shapes, ability to withstand strongly acidic conditions, electrically insulating and flame-retardant properties, and thermal stability to 350 C.  The ionically conductive coatings produced by the process can potentially be applied in batteries, chemical sensors, and biomedical devices.  Uniform microporosity with narrow size distributions can be engineered into the coatings by controlling the process parameters.  Please see US Patent No. 5,569,736.  Note:   THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.   Any company interested in licensing this technology must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by e-mail) no later than 30 days from the publication date of this Notice summarizing the company?s business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.   Companies deemed appropriate will be provided with further information on the technology.  Such information may require an executed Nondisclosure Agreement.  Respondents wishing to enter into negotiations for a commercial license will be required to submit a business plan for the commercialization of the technology prior to licensee(s) selection and negotiations.

<DESC>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), operated by Battelle Memorial Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology.   License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research agreement or CRADA program.  The Technology:  Formation of reverse micelle phases in supercritical fluids is well known, along with their unique useful properties.  These include:  (1) the ability to effect a change of phase behavior of the reverse micelle system by variation of the density with changes in pressure or temperature; (2) the ability to effect a change in micelle size or micelle cluster size by variation of the density; (3) the high diffusivities of solutes and micelles in near critical and supercritical fluids; (4) the ability to control selectivity for a specific solute by variation of density.  There are a number of important potential applications of a micellar phase in supercritical fluids which utilize the unique properties of the supercritical fluid phase.  Many advantages are also obtained for near-critical fluid continuous phase reverse micelle systems.  For example, reverse micelles in supercritical carbon dioxide (CO2) is well documented, and in commercial use, as an environmentally benign and highly effective cleaning system.  The application of these systems in chromatography and for protein separations or extractions are known.  In addition, chemical reactions can be carried out in such systems  Further applications are also envisioned, for instance, polar catalysts or enzymes could be molecularly dispersed in a nonpolar gas phase via micelles, opening a new class of gas phase reactions.  Since diffusivities of reactants or products are much greater in the supercritical fluid continuous phases compared with liquids, high transport rates to and from active sites in the catalyst-containing micelle may increase reaction rates for those reactions which are diffusion limited.  The recovery of product or catalyst from the micelle core may be simplified since the micelle size, and even the existence of a reverse micelle phase, is dependent on fluid pressure.  This is in contrast to liquid systems where pressure has little effect on phase behavior at up to 1000 bar.  This invention has a wide range of applications, generally including a variety of chemical reactions and extraction and separation processes.  It has a number of advantages over conventional liquid reverse micelle and microemulsion systems, including:  (1)  Faster separation, extraction and reaction rates because of the enhanced mass transport properties of supercritical and near-critical fluids.  Diffusivities of solutes and micelles can be 5-100 times higher in near critical liquids and supercritical fluids than they are in liquids; and (2) The ability to manipulate reaction pathways (i.e., selectivity) or rates by varying system pressure.  Please see US Patent No. 5,158,704, and 5,266,205.

<DESC>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), operated by Battelle Memorial Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology.   License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research agreement or CRADA program.  The Technology:  Reinforcements of composites can consist of fibers, particles, or whiskers.  They each have their own unique uses, but long fibers are the most common and have the greatest influence on properties of the composite.  Fibers add the strength to the composite in the direction of the long axis.

The interface between a fiber and a polymer matrix is the Achille's heel of a glass/polymer composite.  Adhesion between the two phases is critical, as is the degree of flexibility within the interfacial region.  A glass surface composes a polar hydrogen bonding chemical environment, whereas the polymer matrix tends to be more hydrophobic and non-polar.  The net result is that the interfacial interactions are weak, leading to poor adhesion and facile interfacial cleavage or displacement.

Presented here is a novel surface modification of the reinforcing fiber--a coupling agent consisting of a self-assembled monolayer (SAM)--that results in greater mechanical strength of the polymer and reinforcing fiber bonding, thus significantly increasing the composite?s tensile and flexural properties.  The complete and uniform coverage afforded by the SAM spreads the load out evenly over a large area of the glass fiber, reducing composite failure due to fiber sheer.  This application would be very good in high fatigue applications or even in severe composite environments that could increase or maintain the physical properties of the material.

Please see published US Patent Application Publication No.  US 2001/008697 A1.

NASA/DFRC intends to purchase Test Automation Technology used to achieve greater cost efficiencies.  NASA/DFRC intends to purchase these items from Software Development Technologies (SDT).  These software items will be used for the Western Aeronautical Test Range (WATR) project. SDT has provided hands-on software testing, consulting, process generation, along with workshops to the FR & FE organizations since December 1999.  SDT has tailored their Dotted-U Model (which includes automating key activities described in the model) to satisfy the NASA/Dryden WATR engineering and operational requirements.  This customization and tailoring process is based solely upon the SDT Dotted-U Model and is considered proprietary information. In accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1 (2)(ii)(a) & (b), NASA deems the Test Automation Technology to be available only through one source, Software Development Technologies (SDT).  To purchase through another source would result in substantial duplication of cost that would not be recovered through competition.  It would also incur unacceptable delays in the mission.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on February 28, 2002.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) intends to solicit applications from State and Local Partnerships under the Million Solar Roofs (MSR) Program.  DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy will consider proposals from interested State and Local Partnerships to help fund their MSR program development and implementation activities.  Applications from State Partnerships are encouraged to apply under the MSR Small Grant Program for State Partnerships.  For information on the MSR Small Grant Program for State Partnerships, refer to the State Energy Programs Solicitation for Fiscal Year 2002 Special Projects at http://www.eren.doe.gov/buildings/state_energy/corner_cafe/special_projects.html .  The MSR Small Grant Program for State Partnerships is Section 6.57 of the downloadable PDF Special Projects Solicitation. A copy of the solicitation will be accessible through the Golden Field Office Home Page at http://www.golden.doe.gov/businessopportunities.html under "Solicitations."  The Golden Home Page will provide direct access to the solicitation and provide instructions on using the DOE Industry Interactive Procurement System (IIPS) web site.  The solicitation can also be obtained directly through IIPS at http://e-center.doe.gov/ by browsing opportunities by Program Office for those solicitations issued by the Golden Field Office. DOE will not issue hard copies of the solicitation. The Department of Energy's MSR Initiative is an initiative to support State and Local Partnerships who agree to install solar energy systems on one million buildings in the United States (U.S.) by 2010.  This effort includes two types of solar energy technology: 1) solar electric (photovoltaic) systems that produce electricity from sunlight, and 2) solar thermal systems panels that produce heat for domestic hot water, for space heating or for heating swimming pools.  The Partnerships bring together business, government and community organizations at the regional level with a commitment to install a pre-determined number (at least 500) of solar energy systems.  New MSR Partnerships can declare their intent to join the Initiative by including such a letter with their application for this solicitation.  A complete description of partnerships and their representative activities can be found on the MSR website at http://www.MillionSolarRoofs.org. Applications under the solicitation must further the work of State and Local Partnerships, including partners in the building industry, state and local governments, utilities, the solar energy industry, financial institutions and non-governmental organizations, to remove market barriers to solar energy use and to develop and strengthen local demand for solar energy products and applications.  Applicants should propose a viable plan for addressing barriers, which inhibit local market penetration and a strategy for strengthening local demand for solar energy products and applications.  For Applicants to become an MSR Partnership and be considered for award under this solicitation, they must possess the capabilities and resources to install a minimum of 500 solar energy systems by 2010. There are two types of grants available: Phase 1 - New Partnership grants, and Phase 2 - Meeting the Commitment grants.  Only one application may be submitted per partnership in one or the other of the categories, but not both. Partnerships that have been awarded prior MSR partnership grants in the past may not apply for a Phase 1 - New Partnership grant.  Newly formed or existing partnerships that have not received prior MSR grants may apply for a Phase 1 - New Partnership grant.  Any partnership with the prerequisites may apply for a Phase 2 - Meeting the Commitment grant.  There is no cost sharing requirement for these grants, although cost sharing will be one of the criteria considered. Subject to the availability of funds, multiple awards for a total of $1,000,000 (DOE funding) in Fiscal Year 2002 are anticipated as aresult of this Solicitation.  The selected applicants will receive financial assistance under a grant.  DOE will fund up to $50,000 per project.  DOE anticipates funding approximately 20 to 30 grants in the amount of $10,000 to $50,000 each. Solicitation number DE-PS36-02GO92005 will include complete information on the program, including technical aspects, funding, application preparation instructions, application evaluation criteria, and other factors that will be considered when selecting applications for funding.  No pre-application conference is planned.  Issuance of the solicitation is planned for mid February 2002, with applications due 45 days after the solicitation has been issued.

<CONTACT>Dixie Harper, (202) 493-5940
<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) intends to modify contract DTFA01-00-C-00099 for Aeronautical Communications Services (ACS) provided by ARINC. <P> An extension of one-year duration is planned (4/1/02 through 3/31/03).  The estimated contract value for the one-year option period will be $350K.   <P> Description of ACS Services:  The current ACS contract provides telecommunications connectivity and services supporting the Tower Data Link System (TDLS), the Meteorological Data Collection and Reporting System (MDCRS), the Dynamic Oceanic Tracks System (DOTS), flight plan processing and approval, Enhanced Traffic Management System (ETMS), and the Washington Operations Center (WOC).  A description of the purpose of provided connectivity is as follows: 1.	TDLS connectivity provides for the distribution of Pre-Departure Clearances (PDCs) to airlines, and the forwarding of Digital Automatic Terminal Information Service (D-ATIS) messages to ARINC for user retrieval.  Connectivity also meets the needs of the data-link requirements of the Terminal Doppler Weather Radar/Terminal Weather Information for Pilots (TDWR/TWIP) system. 2.	MDCRS connectivity allows winds aloft and other data to be collected from airborne aircraft and forwarded to the National Weather Service (NWS). These d! ata are in turn used by NWS in developing winds aloft forecasts that become the basis for FAA aircraft position prediction 3.	DOTS connectivity provides for forwarding planned oceanic flight tracks to airlines to allow route planning and flight plan filing consistent with an optimized oceanic route structure.  4.	Flight plan filing connectivity provides a path for air carrier operations to transmit proposed flight plans to the FAA’s Host Computer 5.	ETMS connectivity provides for the delivery of ETMS flight delay/reschedule messages from Volpe to the airlines and allows the receipt of airline responses to ETMS planned delays. This connectivity is the backbone of the collaborative decision making process that has become central to effective NAS delay management.  6.	Washington Operations Center services provides dedicated transmission service and “assured delivery” for information interchange between Washington Operations Center/Lambs Knoll Transmitter Site and the aviation c! ommunity to allow transmission of special flight requests, accident reports, Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs), and air worthiness directives. This service also provides NADIN terminals to the Washington Operations Center and Lambs Knoll Transmitter Site.  Impact of Not Awarding the ACS Contract to ARINC:  Failure to award the ACS Contract to ARINC will result in a loss of connectivity necessary for successful functioning of supported services. Example impacts are as follows: 1.	Loss of TDLS connectivity with the participating user base will produce unacceptable operational impact to FAA air traffic control personnel. TDLS connectivity allows departure clearances to be delivered electronically to flight crews.  2.	Loss of MDCRS connectivity will result in the inability to deliver winds aloft data from airborne aircraft to the NWS. This in turn will significantly impact the validity of NWS forecasts.  3.	Loss of DOTS connectivity will result in a loss of ability to transmit the opti! mized oceanic route structure to carriers conducting over water operations. Alternate methods that would be non-integrated and possibly error prone would have to be developed. 4.	Loss of ETMS connectivity would disable the FAA’s Collaborative Decision Making (CDM) initiative under which the FAA and airlines cooperate to determine reaction to NAS events that perturb normal operations. The CDM initiative is a major element in the FAA’s program to reduce flight delays and to mitigate the impact of necessary delays. 5.	Loss of Washington Operations Center and Lambs Knoll Transmitter Site connectivity will result in an inability to efficiently disseminate airworthiness directives, NOTAMs, and other data essential to the safe operation of the NAS. <P> The FAA is continuing to do market research pertaining to ACS and has not made a decision on the procurement method to be used for a follow on contract. <P> If anyone feels they can immediately meet the criteria please contact Dixie Harper at dixie.harper@faa.gov. <P>

Quality, for this requirement, is expressed as technical capability that must be demonstrated in each offeror?s technical proposal. Separate price and technical proposals shall be submitted and no pricing information shall be included in the technical proposal. Technical factors are significantly more important than price. Technical proposals shall consist of three, clearly marked sections. Factor 1, Minimum Requirements, will be evaluated on an ACCEPTABLE/UNACCEPTABLE basis in that if the offeror fails to show minimum compliance, that offer may not be considered further in the evaluation process. Factor 2, Technical Risk Assessment, and Factor 3, Performance Risk Assessment, are of equal importance. The offeror may include any information considered necessary to prove the relative merits of their proposal. However, only that information located within each section will be evaluated as part of that section (i.e., information that might be support for both technical and performance risk that is not specifically included in both sections, will only be assessed as part of the section in which it is included). Information shall clearly indicate to which factor or factors the information applies. Technical evaluation factors are as follows: FACTOR 1,  Minimum Requirements. The offeror has successfully demonstrated compliance with all of the minimum performance and/or design requirements contained in the solicitation. This factor will be evaluated on an ACCEPTABLE/UNACCEPTABLE basis. An offeror may be rated UNACCEPTABLE AS SUBMITTED if the proposal has not demonstrated compliance with all minimum requirements but has the potential to do so if amended during discussions. Offerors are cautioned that the Government intends to award without discussions, so proposals deemed UNACCEPTABLE AS SUBMITTED may not be considered for award. Proposals deemed UNACCEPTABLE will not be evaluated for Factors 2 and 3. FACTOR 2:  TECHNICAL RISK ASSESSMENT. The extent to which the offeror?s proposal reflects acceptable technical risk for the government will be evaluated in this factor. Technical risk considerations are those characteristics of the equipment that permit safe and effective use in the designated environment. They are design features, human factors, and ease of maintainability. Human factors engineering is the application of knowledge about human capabilities and limitations to system or equipment design and development. Technical proposals must include sufficiently detailed information to enable evaluation based on the three factors listed in order of decreasing priority: Design Features, Human Factors, Maintainability. FACTOR 3: PERFORMANCE RISK ASSESSMENT. The extent to which the offeror?s proposal reflects an appropriate apportionment of performance risk will be evaluated in this factor. Performance risk considerations are defined as those characteristics of the offeror that give indication of the likelihood of the offeror?s successful performance of the current requirement. They are proposed delivery schedule, record of on-time delivery for same class product, quality of workmanship displayed in same class delivered product, reliability of same class delivered product, business relations exhibited during previous contracts, range and depth of support provided for same class delivered product.  PRICING PROPOSALS will be reviewed to determine completeness and reasonableness.  In support of pricing proposals, offeror shall include copies of established price lists or other documentation setting forth the prices charged to other customers. Failure to submit this pricing information will result in a determination that the pricing proposal is incomplete and the offeror may not be considered further for award. Offeror shall include a completed copy of provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, with their offer. Offeror shall include a completed copy of provision at DFARS 252.212-7000, Offeror Representations and Certification-Commercial Items. Addenda to this provision includes DFARS 252.225-7000, Buy American Act-Balance of Payments Program Certificate; 252.225-7006, Buy American Act-Trade Agreements-Balance of Payments Program Certificate; and 252.225-7035, Buy American Act--North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act--Balance of Payments Program Certificate.  FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions---Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition.  FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. In compliance with said clause, the following FAR clauses apply: 52.203-6, Restrictions on Subcontractor Sales to the Government, with Alternate I; 52.203-10, Price or Fee Adjustment for Illegal or Improper Activity; 52.222-26, Equal Opportunity; 52.222-35, Affirmative Action for Special Disabled and Vietnam Era Veterans; 52.222-36, Affirmative Action for Handicapped Workers; 52.222-37, Employment Reports on Special Disabled Veterans and Veterans of the Vietnam Era. DFARS 252.212-7001, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes Or Executive Orders---Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. In compliance with said clause, following additional DFARS clauses apply:  252.205-7000, Provision of Information to Cooperative Agreement Holders; 252.219-7005, Incentive for Subcontracting with Small Business, Small disadvantaged Businesses, Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Institutions, Alternate I; 252.225-7001, Buy American Act and Balance of Payment Program; 252.225-7007, Trade Agreements; 252.225-7012, Preference for Certain Domestic Commodities; 252.225-7036, North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act; 252.233-7000, Certification of Claims and Requests for Adjustment or Relief; 252.247-7024, Notification of Transportation of Supplies by Sea.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Cancer Prevention Studies Branch (CPSB), plans to procure continuous genotyping services from BioServe Biotechnologies, LTD, 1050 West Street, Laurel Maryland.  This procurement will provide for continuation of research studies previously awarded under NCI purchase order 263 MQ109475.  The CPSB conducts intramural research in the areas of genetics and cancer, nutrition and cancer, chemoprevention and other prevention strategies aimed at lowering human cancer risk.  The purpose of this procurement is to obtain data on polymorphisms from DNA collected from prostate, pancreatic, and gastrointestinal cancer cases, non-cases, and quality control samples in order to understand the role of these enzyme polymorphisms in the etiology of cancer.  The contractor shalll be required to perform the following:  1) provide results of enzyme genotype analyses as a Microsoft excel file,  2) conduct studies on eight previously developed genotype assays on either gastrointestinal/pancreatic or prostate cancer case-control studies.  The contractor shall develop genotype assays on 10 new studies and perform assays, 3) contractor shall provide a report on the method to be used for each genotyping assay, A report (along with the Microsoft Excel file data with the genotypes characterized as homozygous dominant, heterozygous, or homozygous recessive coded as 0, 1, and 2, respectively) shall be provided to the NCI and include all 20 genotypes analyses.  The polymorphisms to be genotype assayed are MnSOD, CYP3A4, CYP1A2, NAT1, Estrogen Receptor, TGF-alpha, p53, Leptin R, IGF-1, IGFBP-3, IGF-2, Endostatin, Endothelin, Cyclin D, PPAR-gamma, Tryosinase, Melanocortin Receptor, Vitamin D Receptor, Glucocorticoid Receptor, and Hormone-sensitive lipase.  The assay development work for several of these polymorphisms have already been performed by BioServe Biotechnology, Inc.  The enzyme polymorphism assays were developed by BioServe in conjunction with investigators within the CPSB for pursuing their role in the development of esophageal cancer in another CPSB-based cohort study conducted in China.  The current acquisition is based on results of the earlier mass throughput developmental work and optimization of the ABI Prizm 7700 genotyping techniques (TAQMAN) and Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) technology.  These approaches have provided extremely accurate and reproducible results, with 100% concordance rates in all blinded control samples analyzed thus far.  BioServe Biotechnology has established expertise and is reknown in the assay of genetic polymoprhisms.  There is a need to continue the work with BioServe Biotechnologies for comparability of data.  To introduce another company would be detrimental to this research work.  BioServe Biotechnologies is the only source known to the NCI researcher that has most of the polymorphism assays currently running with expertise in the mass throughput Taqman and MALDI-TOF techniques which yields 100% reproducibility rate.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EST, on February 20, 2002.  For further information please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent (301)-402-4509.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.   No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Communication-Electronics Command (CECOM), Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD), Humanitarian Demining Office proposes a non-competitive acquisition with Schiebel Technology, Inc, Warrenton, VA and Mirage Systems, Sunnyvale , CA to perform enhancements to the existing Landmine Detection and Survey System.  The existing Landmine Detection and Survey System integrates the Schiebel CAMCOPTER Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) with Mirage Systems' unique Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR)  and differential GPS system.  The system operates from standoff platforms that allow the radar sensor to be remotely located from the ground surface. Other elements of the system include:  a compact radar electronics system that employs a gated FMCW wavef orm with software flexibility to control the parameters of the radar's waveform; a carrier-phase differential GPS system integrated with inertial sensors that provide centimeter-level geo-referenced positional accuracy and full platform orientation informa tion at the high update rates required for precise synthetic aperture radar (SAR) focusing; SAR processing algorithms that form focused and motion-compensated 3D SAR imagery; signal processing algorithms that incorporate specific target features within the  SAR imaging process to provide target characterization; and signal processing algorithms that combine differential GPS data and inertial data to provide positional and orientation information with high accuracy at high update rates.  This procurement is l imited to Schiebel Technology, Inc. and Mirage Systems because this vendor is the only known source for this particular landmine detection system.  The primary tasks will be:  Design and build a processing suite to enable faster and improved image processi ng; Collect and process GPR data gathered at various test sites using the existing CAMCOPTER/Mirage Airborne GPR system; Modify the existing prototype Mirage Airborne GPR to better adapt it for use with the CAMCOPTER UAV, taking into account hardware and v ibration issues identified during previous testing; improve the existing Airborne GPR control software to correct errors and data transfer delays encountered during previous testing; and modify the existing CAMCOPTER UAV Mission Control Program to further enhance its precise mission-planning capabilities.  The duration of this effort is 12 months.  A Cost Plus Fixed Fee contract is expected.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304 (c)(1), Only One Responsible Source and no Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  However, all responsible sources that can provide supporting data to demonstrate they can successfully provide the above landmine detection and survey system may submit a quote that shall  be considered by the agency. Offerors must possess technical expertise and/or experience building the mine proof detection system.  Responses shall be no longer than five (5) pages and provided in Microsoft Word 2000 format.  Responses shall be submitted via email to pat.davis@cacw.army.mil within 30 calendar days of the date of this notice.  The email subject line should include the phrase 'DAAB15-02-R-0017, CAMCOPTER Market Research Response'.  All requests for further information must be in writing and via email to the above address, telephone requests for additional information will not be honored. Acknowledgement of receipt will be issued.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This announcement, below, is changed to reflect a revised due date/time for Stage 1 submissions of 3:00 p.m., Tuesday, February 19, 2002.  All other information remains the same.  The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design for a new Courthouse for the Federal District Courts in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements.  The building is approximately 13,000 gross square meters (140,000 gross square feet) including 33 interior parking spaces, at a site located within or immediately adjacent to the Central Business District of Rockford, IL.  The Estimated construction cost range is $30 million to $40 million.  The facility will be designed in hard metric units.  The scope of work will require at a minimum: metric construction drawings, specifications, cost estimates, value engineering services, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD) and post construction contract services (PCCS) for a Federal Courthouse that includes the construction of the new building and related systems, both site and indoor parking, site development, client program development, and socio-economic and sustainable program features.  This building will also include GSA design standards for secure courthouses.  This building will be an anchor development in the neighborhood and should make a distinct architectural statement that is responsive to the overall urban design and quality of life in this burgeoning mixed-use neighborhood.  This is a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) of A/E Firms/Lead Designers interested in contracting for this work.  The A/E firm, as used in this RFQ, is an association, joint venture, partnership or other entity that will have contractual responsibility for the project design.  The Lead Designer is the individual or design studio that will have primary responsibility for the design concept and the building?s architecture.  The A/E Firm must clearly define the contractual relationship with the Lead Designer and its ability to manage the design and production of construction documents.  The government will not allow payment for travel, living expense, computer time or hookups for the prime or the consultants related to meeting the requirements of this RFQ.  The A/E selection will be completed in three stages, as follows: In Stage I, an interested firm will submit a portfolio of accomplishments to establish the design capabilities of the A/E Firm and its Lead Designer.  All documentation will be in an 8 1/2? x 11? format.  The Stage I submission should include the following: A) a cover letter referencing the CBD announcement and briefly describing the firm, its location, organizational makeup, and noteworthy accomplishments; B) Standard Form 254 (Architect-Engineer and Related Services Questionnaire) and Standard Form 255 (Architect-Engineer and Related Services Questionnaire for Specific Project) modified to include only the A/E?s information (Identification of consultants is not required at this stage) and C) a design portfolio which is to include the following submission requirements and evaluation criteria: (1) Lead Designer Portfolio (35% of evaluated score): Submit a portfolio representative of the Lead Designer?s ability to provide design excellence.  Submit graphics (maximum of three pages per project) and a typewritten description (maximum of two pages per project) of up to three new construction projects completed in the last ten years.  The narrative shall address the design philosophy with salient features for each project and discuss how the client?s program, functional, image, mission, economic, schedule, and operational objectives were satisfied by the overall design/planning solution.  Include tangible evidence where possible such as certificates, awards, peer recognition, etc., demonstrating design excellence.  Where there is duplication with criteria #3, the Lead Designer will address his/her participation in the project. (2) Philosophy and Design Intent (25%): In the Lead Designer?s words, (maximum of two typewritten pages) state the overall design philosophy and approach to the challenge of public architecture, issues, and parameters that may apply in creating a state-of-the-art Courthouse in an urban neighborhood environment. (3) Past Performance on Design (25%): The A/E Firm will submit graphics (maximum of three pages per project) of not more than five new construction projects completed in the last ten years.  The narrative (maximum of two pages per project) shall address the design approach with salient features for each project and discuss how the client?s program, functional, image, mission, economic, schedule, and operational objectives were satisfied by the overall design/planning solution.  Include tangible evidence where possible such as certificates, awards, peer recognition, etc., demonstrating design excellence.  Provide a client reference contact for each project, including name, title, address, phone, and fax numbers.  A portion of one page presented for each project must include a representative floor plan and either a site plan or a building section. (4) Lead Designer Profile (15%): Submit a biographical sketch (maximum of three pages) including education, professional experience, recognition for design efforts inclusive of examples.  Identify and describe areas of responsibility and commitment to each project. An A/E Evaluation Board consisting of a private sector peer, a representative of the client and professional representatives from GSA will evaluate the submissions.  The Board will establish a short-list of three to six firms.  For Stage II, the short-listed firms will be notified and asked to submit more detailed information indicating each member of the design team, including all outside consultants. The firms will be required to complete Standard Forms 254 and 255 that reflect the entire design team.  The Government will establish the detailed evaluation criteria and the date these submittals are due and provide the selection criteria for the interviews along with the Stage I short-list announcement.  Sufficient time will be provided for the A/E Design Firm/Lead Designer to establish its team.  In developing the Stage II project team, A/E firms are advised that at least 35% of the level of contract effort must be performed in the state of Illinois.  The Selection Board will interview each team.  Candidates should be prepared to discuss all aspects of the criteria indicated above and to demonstrate their ability to fulfill all project requirements.  Emphasis will be placed on the unique aspects of the project, design philosophy, possible approaches in carrying out the project, and project management.  The Stage II evaluations will culminate with an interview with the A/E Evaluation Board.  Stage II rankings will be used in conjunction with Stage I rankings to determine the firms that will be invited to participate in Stage III.  A minimum of three firms will be invited to participate in Stage III and will be further evaluated by an anonymous design competition judged by a jury of independent design professionals.  The purpose of the competition is to further evaluate the A/E?s qualifications for this project by evaluating the design merits of each designer?s vision for this specific project.  The design competition submittals will be used in conjunction with Stage II rankings in the final evaluation of the A/E firms.   The designer?s vision will weigh substantially in the final A/E Team selection by GSA.  The submitted designs become the property of the government and may or may not be the basis, whole or in part, for the development of the final building design. This procurement is being made under the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program (F.A.R. 52.219-19).  This procurement is open to small and large business concerns.  In accordance with 15 USC 631 Et. Seq., the A-E will be required to provide the maximum practical opportunities to small, small women-owned, HUBZone small businesses and small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals to participate as subcontractors in the performance of the contract.  The use of subcontractors/consultants shown in the Stage II 255 and SF 254 will be reflected in a Subcontracting Plan which will be included in the contract.  The detailed plan is to be submitted with the SF-255 in Stage II.  Each individual firm will determine the minimum acceptable subcontracting target goals for this project.  A small business criterion for each category is based on the contractor?s average annual receipts for the proceeding three fiscal years.  Contact your local SBA office for further information.  Firms seeking consideration for this contract shall demonstrate a proactive effort to achieve the highest subcontracting goals possible for small business, woman-owned small business, HUBZone small business and small disadvantaged business concerns.  Firms advancing to Stage II must also provide a brief written narrative of outreach efforts made to utilize small, disadvantaged, HUBZone and women-owned businesses.  The narrative shall not exceed one written page.  An acceptable subcontracting plan must be reviewed and approved by SBA prior to award of this contract.  Small businesses are not subject to this requirement.

While the initial identification of potential offerors (to be the prime contractor) was based on market research, this announcement is to 1) solicit responses from additional firms capable of being the prime contractor and 2) identify possible subcontracting sources relating to this procurement.
Any potential prime contractor must have the experience, resources, and past performance judged to offer a low risk and high probability of success in fielding the required explosive detection equipment in December 2002.  The prime contractor selected will be responsible for the coordination and execution of activities required to meet the aviation checked-baggage screening requirements of the Act.  The activities include, but are not limited to purchasing and coordinating the supply of the needed equipment, managing the installation of equipment into the airport environment, providing support for EDS screener training, and managing field service.  (Concurrently, and with regard to accelerating current production of the equipment needed as part of the total solution, efforts are under way to place under contract the entire production lines of known and certified firms that manufacture such devices.)  
The Transportation Security Administration has established the following anticipated subcontracting goals for this program (excluding the acquisition of EDS machines): 40% of subcontracting dollars be awarded to small business; 5% to Small Disadvantaged Business; 5 % to Woman-Owned Business; 3% to Service Veteran-owned small business. 
As stated above, this announcement is seeking sources that can 1) compete at the prime contractor level and 2) businesses to participate as part of the team (subcontract level) and contribute to the overall solution and achievement of the statutorily mandated goal:  field equipment and provide training required to screen 100 percent of checked baggage by December 31, 2002. 
Any firm with the experience, resources, and past performance sufficient to establish its capability to perform as the prime contractor may submit a capability statement not to exceed four pages (at no less than 10-point font) that describes the specific contribution the firm could make to satisfy the various tasks cited above.  
Any firm with the experience, resources, and past performance to support the overall mission need as part of the team at the subcontractor level may submit a capability statement not to exceed two pages (at no less than 10-point font) that describes the specific contribution(s) the firm could make to satisfy the various tasks cited above.  For each of the various tasks cited above that you are capable of supporting, please provide detailed qualifications and references.  Small businesses (including woman-owned, minority, Service/Disabled Veterans, HUBZone, and disadvantaged) are encouraged to participate.  
The capability statement(s) is/are to be emailed to the Contracting Officer at 
richie.lieber@tasc.dot.gov
not later than 1:00 PM EST on Tues, February 19, 2002.  All capability statements received from firms interested in participating at the subcontract level will be provided to the prospective prime contractors.  Statements exceeding the page lengths cited above or received after the due date will be discarded.  
The importance of this initiative to our country and its people is self-evident, as is its urgency.  Those who are chosen will be part of a mission-critical team responsible with TSA to success in protecting the American people and guests of this great nation.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. [3] TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR [TITLE OF PROCUREMENT: Silicon Detector for the Prototype for ACCESS Silicon Matrix ].  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to [Provide an overview of questions and answers received from prospective vendors. Diagrams are attached for viewing].--Question (1): We have been looking into how to route the signals from the central pads in the square array of pads on these detectors to an edge where they can be connnected to pins. We began with kapton foils carrying the traces that were placed on the surface of the detector and bonded to each pad. This will work, but now we are considering to put these traces on the detector itself. The idea is to put a thick glass passivation layer on top of the detector and run the metal traces on top of it. The glass would have penetrations to the  aluminum pad surfaces where the traces would connect and these traces would run to wire-bonding pads on the edges of the detector. Have you done something like this? Our signal dynamic range is large so we need a relatively thick glass layer and thin traces to avoid cross coupling the signals into the  other pads crossed by the traces, but it seems possible to us. [Details for the expansion of the question. Will it be possible to change the design by adding connecting traces from middle pads to two rows of pads from bonding on two sides of detector.[Refer to attached drawing as Det_traces.pdf]: The suggested changing of the existing detector production process is:-After the thermal passivation is done to run additional metallization process for plating of traces and pads for bonding;-Final polyimide passivation should have now windows for 36 contact pads and windows for two rows of pads for bonding. If this would be possible then the questions are: 1. How thick could be the thermal passivation (1...4...10 um?) 2. How much could the thickness of traces be increased 9from standard 0.7um)?   3. What is the thickness of polyimide passivation? 4. Could the plating of traces be done above polymide after the polymide passivation? [Answer: The tracing of metal lines is possible: 1. In first metal layer: We can do it in the first metal layer: We have two options for this. - Place p+ under the metal lines. Then will the metal lines be sensitive to radiation.  -  Do not place p+ under the metal lines. This will add capacitance at the order of 5pF/10mikron linewidth /cm lengthof the metal line.   2.  We can add a second metal layer with polyimide (thickness 5mikron) ad dielectric.  We can then add a 2mikron polyimide as top passivation. This will add capacitance at the order of 0.6pF/10mikron linewidth / cm length of the metal line. this will add the price considerably as this requires 2 extra mask layers. General Comments: The metal resistance is approxiamtely 22 Ohm/cm/ 10 microns linewidth (for 1.2 micron metal thickness). Max metal thickness with standard polyimide passivation is approximately 1.8 mikron.  Thicker metallisation is possible if we use thicker  polyimide passivation (5 micron), but thicker metal and thicker passivation will add some cost. There will be space for metal lines with widths over 100 microns in this design, but this will be a trade off with the capacitance. The element capacitance for 1X1 cm pads should be around 34pF.] [Reply to the answer: we prefer method 2. We will have ceramic plates made with 33 pins along opposite edges. One pin on each edge will be connected to a gold plating on the ceramic plate. This will be the blocking contact connection. The detectors must be attached to the ceramic plate by gold paste (or glue) and the wire bonds made between the 32 pad connections on opposite edges of the detector with the matching pins on the ceramic plate. These wirebonds will need to be stabilized with a silicone compound.[Refer to drawings Cer_Substr.pdf and Contact Window.pdf attached]. The drawing is in a 36-pad version. Now it will be best if we provide the plates and you mount the detectors and do the wire bonds before shipping.--  [Question 2 from vendor: Just to clear something up, will the ceramic plate be continously without a hole? That is the whole detetctor backside glued. Will the pattern be thick film technology?]-- Answer to Question 2. The requirement is for a rectangular ceramic plate with 33 small holes along opposite edges. In these holes there will be pins. One pin on each side will connect to a gold layer fired on the surface of the plate. In the example we made the gold layer had the shape of an "eye" with the corners of the "eye" coming to the middle pin on each side for contact. The detector had gold on its blocking contact side. Gold paste will be used to fix the middle of the blocking contact side of the detector to the middle of the gold "eye" on the ceramic plate. We want to use a glue spot that is large enough to provide mechanical strength so that the detector will not come loose during shock and vibration, but not too large because differential thermal expansion between the ceramic plate and the silicon could break the detector. --  Question 3. -- Will the pattern be thick film technology? In the example we tested, we just painted on gold paste and fired it. This is to be a gold surface that is strongly fixed to the ceramic surface.-- Answer OK. -- Question 4. Are there any special mechanical tolerances of  the assembly? Do you want Al or Au bonding?-- Answer -- The bonding pads along the edges of the detector can be either gold or aluminum, but seemingly aluminum will be less expensive since it seems to avoid another masking step.]--  Four quotes are to be forwarded on the following: (1.) 16 detectors for use with the seperate kapton foil for routing the signals. (2.) The cost per detector for producing up to four additional detectors of this type. (3.) 16 detectors with the signals routed on top of the detectors (4.) The cost per detector for producing up to four additional detectors of this type. The following diagrams are  attached:           The due date for receipt of offers [is] extended to [February 22, 2002].

The purpose of the modification is to update potential offerors on the status of the final solicitation and the Section 845 Other Transactions for Prototypes re-del egations of authority.  All Army delegations to award agreements using the 845 Other Transactions for Prototypes lapsed as of 9/30/01.

No agreement awards can be made without the re-delegation.  All potential offerors will be advised as soon as the re-delegations have occurred.   Significant Army organizations t hat will be affected by OFW, have indicated a desire to perform a 'hands-on' review of the final solicitation prior to its release to industry.  We project this will cause a revised release date as early as 21 February or as late as 8 March 2002.  We offer  this information for planning purposes only and apologize for any inconvenience this has caused industry.  If this information changes, another modification to this synopsis will be published notifying industry of release date changes or receipt of the Se ction 845 OT for Prototype Projects authority.

<DESC>TSA Acquisition Announcement


The Department of Transportation (DOT)/Transportation Security Agency (TSA) has initiated an accelerated competition for the management of a program of critical importance and urgency to our country.  This program is to support and coordinate the fielding of explosive detection equipment as mandated by the Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001.  Consistent with the urgency of this requirement and the authority cited under a Class Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition Under FAR 6.302-2, a competition is underway for the selection of prime contractor to assist TSA with this initiative. While the initial identification of potential offerors (to be the prime contractor) was based on market research, this announcement is to 1) solicit responses from additional firms capable of being the prime contractor and 2) identify possible subcontracting sources relating to this procurement.
Any potential prime contractor must have the experience, resources, and past performance judged to offer a low risk and high probability of success in fielding the required explosive detection equipment in December 2002.  The prime contractor selected will be responsible for the coordination and execution of activities required to meet the aviation checked-baggage screening requirements of the Act.  The activities include, but are not limited to purchasing and coordinating the supply of the needed equipment, managing the installation of equipment into the airport environment, providing support for EDS screener training, and managing field service.  (Concurrently, and with regard to accelerating current production of the equipment needed as part of the total solution, efforts are under way to place under contract the entire production lines of known and certified firms that manufacture such devices.)  
The Transportation Security Administration has established the following anticipated subcontracting goals for this program (excluding the acquisition of EDS machines): 40% of subcontracting dollars be awarded to small business; 5% to Small Disadvantaged Business; 5 % to Woman-Owned Business; 3% to Service Veteran-owned small business. 
As stated above, this announcement is seeking sources that can 1) compete at the prime contractor level and 2) businesses to participate as part of the team (subcontract level) and contribute to the overall solution and achievement of the statutorily mandated goal:  field equipment and provide training required to screen 100 percent of checked baggage by December 31, 2002. 
Any firm with the experience, resources, and past performance sufficient to establish its capability to perform as the prime contractor may submit a capability statement not to exceed four pages (at no less than 10-point font) that describes the specific contribution the firm could make to satisfy the various tasks cited above.  
Any firm with the experience, resources, and past performance to support the overall mission need as part of the team at the subcontractor level may submit a capability statement not to exceed two pages (at no less than 10-point font) that describes the specific contribution(s) the firm could make to satisfy the various tasks cited above.  For each of the various tasks cited above that you are capable of supporting, please provide detailed qualifications and references.  Small businesses (including woman-owned, minority, Service/Disabled Veterans, HUBZone, and disadvantaged) are encouraged to participate.  
The capability statement(s) is/are to be emailed to the Contracting Officer at 
richie.lieber@tasc.dot.gov
not later than 1:00 PM EST on Tues, February 19, 2002.  All capability statements received from firms interested in participating at the subcontract level will be provided to the prospective prime contractors.  Statements exceeding the page lengths cited above or received after the due date will be discarded.  
The importance of this initiative to our country and its people is self-evident, as is its urgency.  Those who are chosen will be part of a mission-critical team responsible with TSA to success in protecting the American people and guests of this great nation.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS
            DO NOT PROVIDE A PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME


This is a Sources Sought Synopsis and Request for Information for solicitation F09634-02-R-0002.  The purpose of this is twofold; (1) to determine interest and capability and (2) to obtain industry input.  The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, licenses and other items or services necessary to perform the management and operation for the Air Force Reserve Recruitment Advertising  Program.  The Air Force Reserve Command is seeking a full-service recruitment-advertising agency for its advertising efforts.  The proposed $7-$13 million annual contract will include creative production and placement of all Air Force Reserve recruitment advertising in national magazines, newspapers, television, radio, internet, direct mail and billboard.  Advertising will support the Prior Service, Non-Prior Service, Health Profession Programs and Officer Programs.  Contractors will be required to develop advertising in selected media; process and track leads; and provide advertising guidance to Air Force Reserve Advertising for effectively communicating the attributes of military service to prospects and influencers.  The contractor will also be expected to provide other normal advertising services such as account management, billing, traffic control,  call center and research. The period of  performance for this contract may be up to ten years or more. We anticipate utilizing a basic and four options with some type of award term incentives.  The mobilization/orientation period is planned from 1 Jul 02 - 30 Sep 02.  The current contract type is a cost plus fixed fee.  We are looking at a new approach for this competition and would like industries' ideas/suggestions.  Commercial Services is one area:  How are your current commercial/federal contracts structured?  Do you see an avenue, considering the definition of a commercial item (FAR 2), to solicit this requirement under FAR 12 (Acquisition of Commercial Items)?  Since we do not know whether we are going FAR 12 or FAR 15, request you submit your suggestions on criteria you would like to see tied to an Award Term type contract.  After reviewing the attached Performance Work Statement, which areas do you feel could be Firm Fixed Price?  We are striving for a Firm Fixed Price contract with reimbursable line item(s).

<DESC>The Coast Guard is seeking sources and budgetary estimates to replace the chemical toilets currently used on the C130 aircraft.  The toilet currently used is manufactured by Monogram Sanitation of Comption, California and the applicable part number is 2900-001.  The Coast Guard seeks to eventually procure replacement chemical toilets that will fit into the space occupied by the Monogram toilet described above.  The replacment toilet must have, as a minimum, a 24 gallon capacity; can be emptied from the outside of the aircraft has leakproof hoses and seals and is FAA approved. Interested parties must provide the Coast Guard with literature and specifications that clearly detail their product, and an estimated cost adequate to determine the approximate overall cost.  If, at a later date, the Coast Guard pursues procurement of this system, we may require the successful vendor to install one (1) chemical toilet for First Article evalution and testing.  First Article Testing period will be for a six (6) month period and the test criteria will be: no measureable leaks from the tank, valves, plumbing, or any components of the toilet system.  The vendor must provide, with the toilet, sufficient data that will allow Coast Guard personnel to install, operate, service and maintain the chemical toilet system.  This is a request for information only.  Interested parties may submit information packages and an estimated cost adequate to determine the approximate total project cost directly to Mr. Kenneth Bly, C130 Equipment Specialist, (252)335-6501.

<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory, Materials and Manufacturing Directorate, Systems Support Division (AFRL/MLSA/MLSC/MLSS), Wright-Patterson AFB, OH intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) F33615-02-R-5609 in April 2002.  The title of this RFP is "Quick Reaction Systems Support".  The award will be an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract with an estimated value of $9.9 million over five (5) years.  The period of performance for the entire effort is 76 months, 72 months of technical effort and 4 months for the final reports.  Technical, financial, and semi-annual progress reports will be required.  This program will be conducted primarily at the contractor's facility; however, some tasks may be performed on-site at AFRL/MLS, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH in order to reduce cost and to utilize available specialized test equipment.  Prospective sources will be required to provide a technical staff, as required, that includes highly qualified engineers, technicians, and administrative support engaged in sustainment and development activities on materials and manufacturing processes.  Responses must include the identity and resume of all personnel to be utilized.  Sources must provide documentation of relevant efforts and experience in each of the technical areas described below, which necessitates a quick reaction response to the requirements in a timely manner.  Sources must include specific information related to capabilities in each area that indicates the organization's background, understanding of the problem, and personnel qualifications.  Organizational brochures and letters of interest are unacceptable.  Sources are sought that have the required knowledge and demonstrated capability to conduct and manage quick reaction support programs, as well as materials characterization and emerging materials transition programs of interest to the Materials and Manufacturing Directorate in support USAF and other DoD weapon systems.  The primary objective of this program is to provide quick reaction support to Air Force Major Command field-level activities, System Program Offices, and Air Logistics Centers.  This quick reaction support will include tasks such as failure analysis of structural hardware; failure analysis of electronic components including electrostatic discharge prevention; coatings, corrosion control materials and processes; materials testing and evaluation; composites fabrication, testing, and training; manufacturing test specimens and fixtures; hosting meetings, conferences, and workshops; aerospace and support equipment structural maintenance; and equipment maintenance/upgrades.  The program will investigate materials and processing related issues from the development phase to the production and operational phases of advanced aerospace systems, and will facilitate the transition of emerging materials and processing technologies to all aerospace weapon systems.  This program is multi-disciplinary in that it covers the technology areas of structural materials, electronic materials, corrosion control, protective coatings, nondestructive evaluation, materials testing and evaluation, and logistics support for emerging materials and processes.  The program will initially consist of three (3) delivery orders with the following objectives: (1) increase the understanding of basic physics in the technical areas of Advanced Composites Supportability and Repair Methods, Adhesives and Bonded Repair, Elastomers and Sealants, Electronic Discharge, and Low Observable maintainability, (2) increase the understanding of basic physics that govern x-ray interlock devices, develop testing methodology for collection and validation of data, and develop creative solutions that focus on shielded and remote x-ray operations that meet known regulatory requirements, and (3) increase the understanding of the basic physics that governs the ultrasonic inspection process, use knowledge gained to develop a prototype testbed that demonstrates appropriate testing for collection and validation of data, and recommend a suitable replacement for obsolete centrally procured ultrasonic equipment used to inspect AWAC rotodomes.  Firms responding should indicate whether they are a small business, an 8(a) firm or a HUBZone firm.  For this item, the general definition used to determine whether your firm is small is as follows:  "A small business concern is a concern that is independently owned and operated, is not dominant in the field of operation in which it is bidding on government contracts and with its affiliates, and the number of employees does not exceed 500 persons."  NAIC Code 541710 applies.  "Concern means any business entity organization for profit, with a place of business in the United States, its possessions, Puerto Rico, or the trust Territory of the Pacific Islands including, but not limited to, an individual, partnership, corporation, joint venture, association or corporation."  The Air Force reserves the right to consider a small business set-aside based upon responses hereto.  All businesses interested in this effort must respond with a complete capability/qualification package describing the company's technical expertise and experience, personnel, and facilities to accomplish the work described above.  All respondents shall include in they response their assigned commercial and Government entity code (Federal Supply Code for Manufacturers, a five digit code assigned by the Commander, Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS), Attn:  Customer Service Office, Battle Creek, MI, phone no. (toll-free) 1-888-352-9333 or (616) 961-4725, E-mail: dlis-support@dlis.dla.mil (Reference DOD 5000.129M).  Respondents are further requested to indicate their status as a foreign-owned firm/foreign-controlled firm, and any contemplated use of foreign national employees on this effort.  Foreign firms should be aware that restrictions might apply which could preclude their participation in this acquisition. Responses submitted should be in one copy only.

Responses shall not be submitted via facsimile or email.  Closing date for submission of responses is within fifteen (15) calendar days from the publication of this notice.  An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from potential offerors during this sources sought phase.  The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or Contracting Officer, but to communicate Contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  Interested parties are invited to contact Lt Col Sam A. Lopez, Det 1 AFRL/PK, telephone (937) 255-4813, e-mail Sam.Lopez@ws.wpafb.af.mil.  All routine communication concerning this announcement, that is non-technical, should be directed to CHRISTINE A.

<DESC>TSA Acquisition Announcement The Department of Transportation  (DOT)/Transportation Security Agency (TSA) has initiated an accelerated competition for the management of a program of critical importance and urgency to our country. This program is to support and coordinate the fielding of explosive detection equipment as mandated by the Aviation and Transportation   Security Act of 2001. Consistent with the urgency of this quirement and the authority cited under a Class Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition Under FAR 6.302-2, a competition is underway for the selection of prime contractor to assist TSA with this initiative. While the initial selection of the potential offerors (to be the prime contractor) was based on 
market research, this announcement is to 1) solicit responses from additional firms interesting in being the prime contractor and 2) identify possible subcontracting goals relating to this procurement. Any potential prime contractor must have the experience, resources, and past performance judged to offer a low risk and high probability of success in fielding the required  explosive detection equipment by December 2002. The prime contractor selected will be responsible for the coordination and execution of activities required to meet the aviation checked-baggage screening requirements of the Act. The activities include, but are not limited to purchasing and coordinating the 
supply of the needed equipment, managing the installation of equipment into the airport environment, provide support for EDS screener training, and life cycle maintenance. (Concurrently, and with regard to accelerating current production of the equipment needed as part of the total solution, efforts are under way to place under contract the entire production lines of known and   certified firms that manufacture such devices.) The Transportation Security Administration has established the following subcontracting goals for this program: 40% of subcontracting dollars be awarded to small business; 5% to Small Disadvantaged Business; 5 % to Woman-Owned Business; 3% to Service  Veteran-owned small business. This announcement is seeking sources that can 1) participate as the prime contractor and 2) businesses to participate as part of the team (subcontract level) and contribute to the overall solution and achievement of the statutorily mandated goal: field equipment and human resources required to screen 100 percent of checked baggage by November 17, 
2002. Any firm interested in being prime contractor may submit a capability statement not to exceed four pages (at no less than 10-point font) that describes the specific contribution the firm could make to satisfy the various tasks cited above. Any firm interested in being a subcontractor may submit a capability statement not to exceed two pages (at no less than 10-point font) 
that describes the specific contribution(s) the firm could make to satisfy the various tasks cited above. For each of the various tasks cited above that you are interested in, please provide detail qualifications and references. Small businesses (including woman-owned, minority, Service/Disabled Veterans, HUBZone, and disadvantaged) are encouraged to participate. The capability 
statement(s) is/are to be emailed to the Contracting Officer at 
richie.lieber@tasc.dot.gov no later than 1:00 on Thursday, February 19, 2002. All received capability statements will be provided to the prospective prime contractors. Statements exceeding two pages or received after the due date will be discarded. No additional information is available at this time. The importance of this initiative to our country and its people is self-evident, as is its urgency. Those who are chosen, through competitive processes based on ideas and solutions, with consideration of cost and risk, will be part of a mission-critical team responsible with TSA to success in protecting the American people and guests of this great nation.

<SUBJECT>--Sources Sought Notice Market Survey
<DESC>NA This is a Sources Sought Notice to survey potential suppliers regarding the capability of their product to meet the technical, cost and schedule requirements of the Well Drilling System described as follows.  It is the intent of the government to replace t he current Well Drilling System with a new Well Drilling System that incorporates the latest technology and provides additional drilling depth capability.  The new Well Drilling System will be configured into modules that are compatible with Load Handling System (LHS) Trucks and Trailers.  The modules will be based on a flatrack, compatible with the Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT) LHS and the Palletized Load System (PLS) Trailer and be C-130 transportable.  The modules must operate independen t of the truck (on the PLS Trailer or on the ground).  All electric, hydraulic and pneumatic power for the modules will come from the module(s).  The complete Well Drilling System must fit onto a maximum of two HEMTT-LHS trucks and two PLS Trailers.  The g overnment intends to award a developmental contract in late FY02 to produce one or two prototype units; delivery approximately six months after contract award.  After successful completion of testing at a Government test site, a production contract will be  awarded in FY04.  Production quantities are anticipated to be three to four Well Drilling Systems per year over approximately eight years.  No compensation can be made for participation in the survey.  The Market Survey, Requirements Description, HEMTT-LH S Brochure and PLS and 1077 Brochure are available in the Market Survey section of the TACOM website, http://contracting.tacom.army.mil/opportunity.htm.  Responses to the survey must be received by March 15, 2002.  Contact Karen Montgomery, 586-575-8505 fo r additional information.

<SUBJECT>A -- EO/IR Workshop
<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is hosting a Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) Passive Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) Workshop on March 22 - 22, 2002 at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, MD.  The purpose of the workshop is two-fold:  (1) MDA specifically seeks to gather information to help it plan and evaluate MDA EO/IR technology investments and opportunities; and (2)MDA seeks to improve cohesion in the EO/IR community supporting MDA activities.  Additionally, MDA would like to better understand EO/IR activities and promote technology exchange among the EO/IR community.  Due to the limited time available, the talks at the workshop are by invitation only with appropriate experts concentrating on specific areas of interest to ballistic missile defense.  However, MDA invites and strongly encourages the whole EO/IR community to attend and actively participate in this workshop.  The workshop will be conducted at the Secret level.  A web site has been developed for the workshop and registration.  Please check at www.youreventinfo.com contantly for the updated information about the workshop.  The point of contact for this workshop is Dr. Meimei Tidrow (MDA/AC) at 703-697-3651, or e-amil at meimei.tidrow@bmdo.osd.mil.
