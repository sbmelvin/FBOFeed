<DESC>ANNOUNCEMENT OF PRESOLICITATON CONFERENCE, HSG, BROOKS CITY BASE, TX. DESCRIPTION:   THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE. The Human Systems Group, Brooks City-Base, (San Antonio) TX will host a Presolicitation Conference related to the potential procurement of Program Advisory and Assistance Support (PAAS), reference FA8902-05-R-1000.  All vendors, especially Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses, interested in this acquisition are encouraged to attend this event. A firm must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (www.ccr.gov) to attend the PAAS Presolicitation Conference, no exceptions. Attendance is limited to 5 individuals per firm due to limited seating. There is no fee to attend this conference, and lunch is not provided.  North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code expected to be applicable to this acquisition is 541330 using the exception for engineering services on military and aerospace equipment and military weapons with a size standard of $23 million.
The all-day PAAS Presolicitation Conference will be held on 29 Jun 2005.  Sign-in will begin at 8:00 a.m., with the conference beginning promptly at 8:30 a.m. (central time) at Bldg 775, 2601 Louis Bauer Drive, Brooks City-Base, TX.  The Presolicitation Conference is an opportunity to bring interested businesses together to hear from the Contracting Officer and Senior Program Officials about the acquisition of advisory and assistance services, which encompass management and professional studies, analyses and evaluations, and engineering and technical support to supplement government organic resources in support of the Headquarters Human Systems Group (HSG), 311th Human Systems Wing (HSW), and Brooks City-Base (BCB) tenant organizations.  It is our intent that businesses network and explore possible teaming or joint venture arrangements with other firms as well as potential subcontracting opportunities during break periods. The session will also assist AF acquisition professionals and program officials to gauge the level of interest by small businesses in the various socioeconomic categories, particularly Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses.  Offerors should submit questions regarding the Draft RFP that they would like to be addressed at the Presolicitation Conference to the Contracting Officer, Mr. Richard Williams at richard.williams@brooks.af.mil no later than 21 Jun 05. Questions arising at the Presolicitation Conference must be submitted in writing, and all questions and answers will be posted on the febbizopps website following the conference. This presolicitation announcement is not a contract, or a request for proposals, or a promise to contract, or a commitment of any kind. The AF will NOT assume liability for costs incurred by any offeror for travel expenses, presentations, marketing efforts, or any data offered for examination; therefore, the cost of preparing information in response to this notice is not considered an allowable direct charge to the Government.  The PAAS acquisition strategy has not been finalized at this time. The AF anticipates soliciting for these requirements in July/August 2005.     

Conference participants will not be allowed to use recordable media, cell phones, palm pilots, laptops, etc. during the sessions. To enter base, a driver’s license, a picture ID for all vehicle occupants, proof of vehicle insurance, and admittance letter signed by the government contracting office are required.  Firms need to preregister for this event and request this admittance letter by email.  The request should include the name of the firm, business address, attendees’ full names, and a point of contact, email address, and phone number. Interested parties should register with Lora Rodriquez or Carol Estes by email no later than 22 Jun 2005.  Email addresses are lora.rodriquez@brooks.af.mil or carol.estes@brooks.af.mil. After you preregister, you will receive the admittance letter, a map, and additional details regarding the conference.  Additionally, visitors may be required to go through a security screening check point on the base. 

If you plan on attending the Presolicitation Conference, the only gate for visitors is the gate at Henderson Court (which is off South Presa Street or Old Corpus Christi Road).   Due to construction, there is no access on Southwest Military Drive for non-government ID card holders.   Please be advised that traffic may be backed up due to ID checks at the gate, so allow for gate delays in processing ID checks and time for sign-in at the auditorium, as the Presolicitation Conference will start promptly at 8:30 a.m.

<DESC>This solicitation will be posted on or about June 18, 2008. 
The Bureau of the Public Debt on behalf of the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) is contracting to acquire detailed information regarding the most commonly diverted drugs. Specifically, a detailed, comprehensive characterization of prescription drug diversion is needed. This project will achieve that goal by determining whether the methods by which prescription drugs are purchased conform to distinct patterns and whether those patterns are indicative of suspicious behavior. 

The government also requires an assessment of the magnitude of prescription drug diversion. Having first identified the methods of acquisition associated with commonly diverted prescription drugs (as detailed above), this project will estimate the proportion of prescription drugs that are likely diverted from the legitimate market either for illicit resale or abuse.

Finally, the need exists for an evaluation of the impact and effectiveness of Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs. The project will analyze prescription drug acquisition patterns and trends throughout the United States and will develop estimates of prescription drug diversion in each of the 50 U.S. states. Those estimates of diversion will then be used to determine whether a correlation exists between the presence or absence of Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs and the estimated diversion in each state.

Vendors shall not contact ONDCP regarding this solicitation. Contacting ONDCP may jeopardize any offer submitted on behalf of the vendor. 

Interested offerors may register at http://www.fedbizopps.gov to receive notification when the solicitation and any amendments are issued and available for downloading. Please note that the General Services Administration provides the notification service as a convenience and does not guarantee that notifications will be received by all persons on the mailing list. Therefore, we recommend that you monitor the FedBizOpps site for all information relevant to desired acquisitions. Any additional questions shall be submitted electronically at psb3@bpd.treas.gov.

The Treasury program provides technical assistance and policy advice on sovereign debt matters in an emerging market environment to senior ministerial and central bank officials, as well as to market participants in host countries.  Resident assignments are generally for one year and may be renewed.  This recruitment is for global assignments and international travel is required.

Applicants should have a minimum of 10 to 15 years of experience in government debt issuance and/or management of public borrowing or other relevant experience.  A strong background in public finance, investment banking, public sector financial advisory work, government securities trading, state and local government securities underwriting, issuance and sales, securities and/or treasury operations, or in related areas, would constitute relevant experience.  Knowledge of international bond markets is highly desirable.   Candidates must be U.S. citizens or U.S. resident aliens.  Only those qualified and seriously interested in relocating to one of the above locations should apply for these positions.

<DESC>The purpose of this synopsis is to notify the public of the Military Sealift Command’s intent to issue a sole source contract to Kiewit Offshore Services, Inc. as outlined below.  

MSC has been tasked by NAVSEA, Program Executive Office Integrated Warfare Systems (PEO IWS) to contract for the services that supplement those services under contract via an existing Raytheon Corporation (Raytheon) contract though a subcontract with Kiewit Offshore Services, Inc.(KOS).  As such, these services must be obtained from KOS on a sole source basis.

PEO IWS has been designated as the acquisition agent for the Cobra Judy Replacement (CJR) program.  This program includes the construction of a new ship (T-AGM 25) and Mission Equipment to replace the existing USNS OBSERVATION ISLAND Cobra Judy sensor suite.

The T-AGM 25 is being procured by PEO Ships, PMS-325.  The ship is currently under construction at VT Halter Marine Inc., in Pascagoula, MS.  The contract completion date for T-AGM 25 is 23 June 2010.  Upon delivery MSC will operate and maintain the vessel for PEO IWS.

Raytheon is under contract to PEO IWS to design, develop, and build the radar mission equipment and to install, integrate and test this equipment onboard T-AGM 25.

PEO IWS is contractually obligated to provide T-AGM 25 to Raytheon as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE), ready for mission equipment installation, no later than 15 October 2010 at a location of Raytheon’s specification.  Raytheon has contracted with Kiewit Offshore Services, Inc. (KOS) located in Ingleside, TX as the mission equipment installation site.

The contract between Raytheon and KOS does not include the following requirements: that pier space be available; that the ship be put through a stability test; that accesses be cut to allow for installation of mission equipment; or that standard pier services, such as shore power and garbage removal be provided.  The contract between Raytheon and KOS does not explicitly state that a ship will be present at KOS, or that pier space should be reserved for a ship.  The proposed contract will meet these requirements. 

As KOS is in control of its facilities, KOS is the only vendor able to provide KOS pier space for the duration of the installation in addition to the ship services associated with the installation of the mission equipment. 

All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered.

<DESC>	
The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) intends to award a sole source contract to Lockheed
Martin Maritime Systems and Sensors (MS2) of Moorestown, New Jersey for continued
Combat System Engineering Agent (CSEA) support to the Aegis Ballistic Missile
Defense (BMD) Open Architecture initiatives, integration of Standard Missile (SM-3)
Blocks IB and IIB and development efforts and program planning for future baselines.
This effort is part of the Aegis BMD (AB) Program and requires continued CSEA efforts
to design, develop and test Aegis BMD Weapon System computer programs and other
upgrades for Aegis Cruisers and Destroyers. The contractor will continue to provide the
necessary material, equipment, supplies and technical engineering required to define,
design, develop, integrate, test, deliver Weapons System capability to support
developmental testing, the flight test program and ground test Campaigns, tracking
exercises, critical experiments, surveillance missions, and other risk reduction efforts, and
ultimately operational capability for Aegis Cruisers and Destroyers. The contractor will
continue to work in close collaboration with the Prime Contractors for the other MDA
Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) Elements and the MDA National Teams to
optimize Aegis BMD performance as part of the BMDS. The proposed contract may also
include Foreign Military Sales (FMS) efforts. Lockheed Martin MS2 has been the prime
contractor for Aegis Weapon System (AWS) computer program development and the
Aegis CSEA since Aegis Program inception in 1969 and will continue as the CSEA for
Aegis Open Architecture. This contractor is a highly specialized source and no other
suppliers or services will satisfy agency requirements. As a result of Lockheed Martin’s
involvement in the Aegis BMD Program, it is the only other source that currently
possesses the in-depth technical knowledge of the systems requirements to perform the
work contemplated herein. No source, other than Lockheed Martin, has access to the
proprietary data, resident expertise, and resources to perform the work described herein.
This expertise cannot be obtained by any other contractor within the anticipated period of
performance without incurring substantial costs and risk. The anticipated period of
performance for the effort is up to 10 years after contract award. The proposed contract
action is for system engineering expertise for which the Government intends to solicit
and negotiate with only one source under the authority of 10 USC 2304(c) (1) as
implemented in FAR 6.302. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.
Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact Lockheed Martin
MS2 directly. See Note 22.

<DESC>Title:  Collection and Taxonomy of Shallow Water Marine Organisms

POTENTIAL OFFERORS WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR DOWNLOADING THEIR OWN COPY OF THE SOLICITATION AND ANY AMENDMENTS THAT MAY HAVE BEEN ISSUED. This acquisition is being advertised under full and open competition. 
The National Cancer Institute is seeking a qualified contractor to provide support to NCI’s Natural Products Branch (NPB), Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP), Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD), NCI.  The NCI is seeking a contractor to collect a substantial number of marine invertebrate samples for extraction and subsequent screening for antitumor activity.  This project is to continue the exploration of marine organisms from the Tropics and other areas where unusual habitats may have well evolved more specialized organisms and to use these organisms as a source of potential new agents (pharmacophores) which can be developed for the selective treatment of cancers in humans.  
The target is to collect, taxonomically identify to species level, and to ship up to 450-500 samples per year (on average) over the five year contract term, of marine invertebrates (which may include up to 10% of algae/cyanophytes) with wet weights of roughly 1 kilogram each, in a frozen condition from the collection sites to NCI-Frederick.  In all collections, the major objective of the program is that the collected species be from as wide a diversity of phyla and classes as is possible.
The major collection areas will be the tropical and subtropical areas of the World’s oceans from sea level to ~50 meters.  Collections from both niche areas and from depths exceeding SCUBA depths of ~50 meters may be considered provided scientific rationales and access to suitable equipment are acceptably defined and realistically feasible.  Collections may be performed by subcontractors/consultants to the prime contractor.  Due to uncertainties, collections need not be performed in every year of the contract, but the contractor must have the capacity and requisite expertise to collect, taxonomically identify to species level, and to ship up to 450-500 samples per year (on average) over the contract term. 
Request for Proposal (RFP) N02-CM-87021-17 may be accessed on/about August 20, 2008, at the NCI Office of Acquisitions Website at URL: http://rcb.nci.nih.gov/.  Once there, click on Current Requests for Proposals.  Under the Section entitled Current Requests for Proposals, click on number N02-CM-87021-17 entitled, "Collection and Taxonomy of Shallow Water Marine Organisms."  Interested parties are expected to review this notice and the Request for Proposal to familiarize yourself with the requirements of this project; failure to do so will be at your firm’s own risk.  POTENTIAL OFFERORS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR DOWNLOADING THEIR OWN COPY OF THE RFP AND ANY AMENDMENTS.  It is the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor the above website for the release of this RFP and amendments, if any. 
This solicitation is anticipated to result in one (1) award to an offeror capable of performing all aspects of the work described in the statement of work.  This contract shall be cost-reimbursement, completion type and will be awarded for a period of five (5) years.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Government.  This advertisement does not commit the Government to award any contract.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541712 with a size standard of 500 employees. The proposed contract project represents a re-competition of NCI Contract N02-CM-27003 with Coral Reef Research Foundation.
Collect calls will not be accepted.

<DESC>Wind Cave National Park intends to award a contract for radio transmitter collars to Advanced Telemetry Systems, Inc. (ATS) on a non-competetive basis.
Wind Cave National Park has purchased radio transmitter collars from ATS under a previous contract (elk research). Collars are returned to ATS at the end of the study period for refurbishment and subsequent reuse. ATS is the only company that will refurbish its manufactured collars. Also, for data to be meaningful and comparative between elk projects, resolution of data from collars (accuracy, fix rate, etc.) must be similar, therefore, it is imperative that any additional collars be configured in exactly the same manner as the other 50 GPS collars that have been purchased for elk monitoring at Wind Cave National Park.Past market research and solicitations for the same and similar items have shown ATS to have competitive pricing and the ability to provide a reliable, sturdy and quality product that is able to meet specific project requirements.
Award will be made o/a August 19, 2008.  Contact person for questions is Chris Esper at 605-574-3153 or email at chris_esper@nps.gov.  Award amount for the contract is anticipated to be $24,760.00.
(1)  Collars must be constructed on a GPS engine with a minimum of 08 parallel channels. (2)  Collars must be reprogrammable and capable of recording locations at >2 rates specified by the purchaser.  (3)  Collars must be capable of operating for >1 year at a primary fix rate of 1 location every 7 hours (year-round) and on days specified by the purchaser at a secondary rate of 1 location every 15 min (~3 days/month).  (4) 	Collars that fail will be repaired or replaced by the vendor up to 2 years from the time they are placed on wildlife.  After 2 years, the components that are replaced during the refurbishing jobs will be guaranteed up to 1 year.  Failures will include malfunctions of the GPS receiver or antenna, power supply, VHF transmitter, mortality sensor, release mechanism, or any other component that is critical for normal data acquisition and collar recovery.  If failed collars cannot be recovered, the determination of failure will be made by the purchaser. (5) Collars must include VHF radio transmitters that indicate mortalities of animals (unit must include mortality sensor).  (6) Collars must record animal activity levels and ambient temperatures coincident with animal locations.  (7) Records associated with each location must also include x and y coordinates, the time of location, the amount of time required to acquire the location, the number of satellites used to compute the location, and measures of horizontal and positional dilution of precision.  (8) Collar recovery must be accomplished by release with a pulse-coded radio triggering mechanism operating at a frequency of 173.2 MHz. (09) Collars must include VHF radio transmitters operating on unique frequencies ranging from 166-168 MHz.
Collars will be deployed on elk that may potentially be infected with chronic wasting disease, and will be reused.  (10)  Bid must include the cost of refurbishing each collar for reuse.  (11) Refurbishment to be accomplished by the manufacturer within 45 days of receipt from purchaser. (12) To eliminate risk of disease transmission, refurbishment must include complete replacement of collar material, antenna, release mechanism.  (13) To assure reliable operation during reuse, refurbishment must include software updating, replacement of the collar release mechanism, replacement of the battery, and recalibration of electronics controlling the release mechanism.  (14)  Transmitters to have a readable label containing Park contact information. (15) Warranty and servicing must guarantee new units unconditionally against defects in materials and workmanship, and to meet or exceed agreed upon specification.

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to issue a competitive solicitation, N00024-08-R-6326, for the Commanders Leadership Program (CLP). The intent of the program is to deliver a concentrated business curriculum that will enhance the leaders awareness of the corporate culture and business management practices as they execute largely DOD/DON policy issues. The CLP design will provide attendees with education in current and cutting-edge business practices sufficient to allow them to recognize current opportunities and threats, to anticipate potential changes in the business world that would ultimately lead to coordination and implementation of anticipatory responses. The curriculum will be rigorous and provide the Command leadership with a comprehensive education that encapsulates the core competencies of a Masters in Business Administration curriculum. The Contractor is required to provide a residential executive-level education program geared to the needs of mid-grade Naval Officers and NAVSEA civilian counterparts, so as to allow them to understand the operation and workings of American business. The CLP will encompass a series of academic coursework in the areas of leadership, strategic management and communications, globalization and national security, and public management practices. The length of individual coursework will range from three (3) to ten (10) consecutive days of instruction based on subject content. NAVSEA will require an annual CLP program deployment to conclude within 26 months. The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available on the Navy Electronic Commerce Site (NECO) in the near future. The solicitation number will be N00024-08-R-6326.  Vendors wishing an electronic copy may download it directly to their workstation on or after the issue date by accessing the following address via the internet site or URL: http://www.neco.navy.mil. Hard copies of the solicitation will not be provided or mailed to contractors. CAUTION: This solicitation will be issued electronically as will any amendments thereto.

The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) intends to award on a Sole Source basis a Cost Plus Fixed Fee contract to Miltec Corporation, 678 Discovery Drive, Huntsville, AL 35806.  NSWCDD has a requirement for further development of the latest version of KWEVAL software to support lethality analysis at NSWCDD.  It is anticipated that this will be a 48-month effort that includes a base period and options.  Award to any other contractor would be a major duplication of expense in providing an upgrade to the KWEVAL software.  Miltec was the sole designer and developer of KWEVAL, and award to any other contractor would result in a duplication of dollars spent and a slippage in time schedule which is not acceptable.  The anticipate award date is 30 September 2008.  Interest parties other than Miltec Corporation must demonstrate in writing their capability to provide the required services.  Any questions may be faxed to (540) 653-7088, Attn: Code XDS113; email address is:  DLGR_NSWC_XDS11@navy.mil, or telephone (540) 653-7091 or delivered to:  Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, 17632 Dahlgren Road, Suite 157, Dahlgren, VA 22448-5110  Reference number N00178-08-R-1028.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. USAID/Uganda invites comments and suggestions from interested parties on the attached DRAFT request for proposal in order to enhance and further refine the draft RFP. Comments (e.g., feasibility of the requirement including performance requirements, statement of work, data requirements, suitability of proposal instructions and evaluation criteria) will be appreciated and considered as we finalize the RFP, however comments and suggestions may or may not be incorporated in the final RFP. Eligible firms and organizations are strongly encouraged to review the document, provide comment and consider submitting a proposal in response to the resulting RFP. USAID/Uganda will not be able to respond to questions or requests for clarifications and/or additional information resulting from this presolicitation notice or the draft RFP. 

The purpose of this contract is to achieve Presidential Malaria Initiative (PMI)/Uganda targets in indoor residual spraying through: (1) implementing a high quality IRS program, (2) conducting comprehensive monitoring and evaluation of the IRS program and (3) developing national capacity to conduct IRS. The proposed activities are to be done with full collaboration of the Uganda National Malaria Control Program (NMCP). 

In June 2005, the United States Government announced that Uganda had been selected to be included in the President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI), a five year, $1.2 billion initiative to rapidly scale-up malaria prevention and treatment interventions in high burden countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The goal of PMI is to reduce malaria-related mortality by 50% by the end of 2010 in vulnerable groups; children under five, and pregnant women.  PMI/Uganda has a five-year strategic plan and an annual malaria operational plan for Uganda which guides current implementation and scale-up of activities. The PMI is a USAID-led initiative that is implemented in partnership with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In FY06, the first year of PMI, Uganda received $9.5 million.  In FY07, funding doubled to $21.5 million, and in FY08, funding increased again to $22 million.  In subsequent years, Uganda expects to continue to receive funding upwards from $22 million annually until FY10 to achieve PMI goals. Whereas it is still unclear if PMI will be continued in FY11 and FY12, planning is for comparable levels of funding for malaria in out years. IRS is the largest component of FY08 malaria operational plan and is the cornerstone of the PMI/Uganda program.

This contract will fall under the USAID/Uganda’s Investing in People strategy, a comprehensive effort to improve outcomes in health, HIV/AIDS and education in Uganda.  The Investing in People strategy supports the public and private sectors to preserve and nurture human capacity by working towards a healthier and more educated society.  Through its many partners and projects, USAID aims to prevent diseases, improve treatment for the sick and enhance health care and support, especially among the most vulnerable groups.  Many lives can be saved by ensuring that vulnerable populations; such as infants, children, women of reproductive age, people with disabilities, internally displaced persons, and orphans are able to access high quality and affordable health and social services and related products.   

Please do not submit a Proposal in response to this draft RFP; it will not be considered. USAID/Uganda requests all written comments by close of business on Tuesday, August 19, 2008. To ensure prompt receipt, comments should be sent preferably by e-mail to Sam Nagwere at snagwere@usaid.gov and copied to Sara Acio at sacio@usaid.gov.

Issuance of this draft RFP does not constitute an award commitment on the part of the US Government, nor does it commit the US Government to pay for any costs incurred in the preparation or submission of comments, suggestions, or a proposal. Furthermore, the Government reserves the right to defer issuance of a RFP solicitation or not to issue a RFP, if such action is considered to be in the best interest of the Government.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The Agency of Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration (SAMHSA),
Office of the Administrator (OA), through the Program Support Center, Division of Acquisitions Managements, intends to award a sole source contract using simplified acquisition procedures to the National Minority Aids Council (NMAC), 1931 13th 
Street, NW, Washington, DC 20009.

The purpose of this contract is three fold:  to conduct the Annual One-SAMHSA National Minority AIDS Initiative (MAI) Grantee Conference; conduct a SAMHSA Consultation on Substance Abuse, Mental Health and HIV/AIDS in the African-American population; and to develop a White paper that will assess the nature, extent and scope of the HIV/AIDS and substance abuse and mental health disorders in this specific population.  A narrative on each item follows:

One-SAMHSA HIV/AIDS Conference:
The Annual One-SAMHSA National Minority AIDS Initiative (MAI) Grantee Conference will be co-located with the United States Conference on AIDS sponsored by the National Minority AIDS Council.  Only at the U.S. Conference on AIDS will SAMHSA staff and grantees have the triple opportunity to further enhance their knowledge and skills, interface with the broadest and largest convocation of HIV/AIDS service providers, and network with other Center grantees to leverage local, state, regional and federal resources. 

Conference Overview:  This collaborative effort among each of SAMHSA’s Centers will result in a two-day conference, scheduled for FY 2008- 2009.  

The SAMHSA National MAI Grantee Conference will be a landmark effort for the agency and is unprecedented among HHS MAI activities.  SAMHSA will utilize state-of-the-art technology to map the wave of the dual epidemics of HIV/AIDS and substance abuse and highlight the geographic distribution of SAMHSA HIV/AIDS, hepatitis, and substance abuse prevention and treatment and mental health MAI grantees to help guide future planning and targeting resources.  SAMHSA will use this information to construct State and regional platforms to guide the content development of conference plenary sessions, workshops, roundtables and poster sessions.  

The SAMHSA National Minority AIDS Initiative (MAI) Grantees Conference has been highlighted by the Secretary’s Office of HIV/AIDS policy as a successful initiative designed to unite, connect, and expand the capacity of MAI grantees to collaborate for increased access and utilization of HIV/AIDS, substance abuse prevention and treatment and mental health services for minority populations. The objectives for this national conference are:  1) to enhance community-based capacity for integrated systems of care for HIV/AIDS and substance abuse prevention and treatment and mental health; 2) to address sustainability of SAMHSA MAI programs through synergetic exchanges of HIV and substance abuse prevention and treatment and mental health programs, policies, and best practices among community and faith-based providers; 3) to cross-fertilize and facilitate sustainability by exposing MAI grantees to the missions and funding priorities of other Federal agencies; 4) to promote Rapid HIV Testing and HIV testing technology; and  5) to increase the number of qualified candidates among MAI grantees represented in the SAMHSA National Registry of Effective Programs and Practices (NREPP).  

A SAMHSA Consultation on Substance Abuse and Mental Health and HIV/AIDS in the African American population:  The rate of HIV/AIDS diagnosis in the African American community is 7 times that of whites. Blacks made up 15% of all new HIV diagnoses between 2001 and 2005.  There us also a high prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in the African American community.  This consultation will introduce key organizations to SAMHSA and its initiatives to address HIV/AIDS.

The National Minority AIDS Council (NMAC) is requested to conduct a SAMHSA consultation to bring key constituent groups together to consult on the crisis among African Americans with all three Centers and Offices to better inform SAMHSA on how to develop culturally-based and sustainable responses to the HIV/AIDS epidemic for the African American population with substance abuse and/or mental health disorders and HIV/AIDS.

White Paper in partnership with the National Black Women’s HIV/AIDS Network
A White Paper is to be developed in partnership with the National Black Women’s HIV/AIDS Network that will assess the nature, extent, and scope of HIV/AIDS and substance abuse and mental health disorders in the African American female population in the United States.

 The proposed simplified acquisition is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of far 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest by responding to the requirement within 10 days after the date of publication of this notice.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed simplified acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.   Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

EXPRESSION OF INTEREST
ROLLA, MISSOURI

Requirement:  The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Rolla, Missouri that will be expiring.  The Government is seeking to lease approximately 104,752 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space.  The rentable space must yield a minimum of 91,364 of contiguous ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet.  The lease term requirement is for 15 years years.  The space must be available for occupancy by August 31, 2009.  The delineated area is Rolla city limits.

Other requirements applicable to this requirement include:

•	Parking (a minimum of 541 on site surface spaces)
•	Security (i.e. lobby, loading dock access, parking, etc.)

The Government is considering whether to remain in its existing lease space or relocate to alternative space.  In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government’s requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, non-productive agency downtime, etc.  

Please send expressions of interest to:
	Shari Ertz
	General Services Administration
	1500 Bannister Road, Room 2211
	Kansas City, MO 64131
	Telephone:  816-823-5791

•	ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet (OASF) to be offered and expected rental rate per OASF, fully serviced.
•	Date of space availability.
•	Method of rentable space measurement.
•	Building Ownership Information.
•	Amount of parking available on-site and its cost – include whether expected rental rate includes the cost of the required Government parking (if any).
•	List of building services provided.

The Government’s decision regarding whether or not to relocate will be based, in part, on information received in response to this advertisement.  In the event that a potential offeror fails to provide specific rental rate or other required information as part of its response to this advertisement, the Government reserves the right to assume that the building in question cannot meet the Government’s requirements.  Responses by other than owner or manager of the property must include written permission of the owners of the space.

<DESC>HSCG87-08-Q-643407-The United States Coast Guard, Civil Engineering Unit Juneau has a requirement to repair/upgrade process control devices at the ISC Kodiak Wastewater Treatment Plant at Kodiak Alaska.  It is anticipated that a non-competitive sole source purchase order will be issued for this requirement. The existing control devices were installed and programmed by Dowland-Bach Corporation of Anchorage on a previous contract.  The additional upgrade and programming need to be compatible with instrumentation previously installed and programmed.  It was determined that introducing another programming firm would compromise the OEM's responsibility for performance of all installed equipment and avoid unnecessary expenses another firm would incur to research the entire control system to meet requirements.  The contractor is to furnish all equipment, materials, transportation, labor and supervision to repair/upgrade process control equipment and programming for the Wastewater Treatment Plant.  The contractor shall install a multitrode probe level sensor in the wet well Connect and integrate the sensors to the existing process system programmable logic controller (PLC).  A stilling well shall be installed in the effluent weir channel area of the ultra sonic level sensor to better read flow conditions.  A line-interactive (on-line) Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) shall be installed to provide protection against power fluctuations for the existing UV disinfection system (TrojanUV3000Plus).  This project is being advertised as a 4th fiscal quarter FY2008 project with award anticipated prior to 9/30/08 if sufficient funding is available. However, award may be delayed until 1st fiscal quarter FY09 (period beginning 10/01/08) funding becomes available.  This notice is neither a request for proposal nor a solicitation of offers.  A determination not to compete this proposed procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

NCIC check and fingerprint of all contractor employees will be conducted at Government expense.  Contractor-provided background checks will be reevaluated annually, and will be updated by the contractor as required at the contractors expense.
4.  Emergency Access:  Each Marine Corps installation develops its own procedures which allow the contractor quick access without compromising installation security for situations in which contractor response is crucial in order to preserve and/or restore critical facilities.  The contractor is responsible for ascertaining and complying with the procedures established by each installation on which it does business.  
5.  Installation Access Badges:  Each Marine Corps installation develops its own procedures for readily identifying contractor employees working on the installation.  The installation may either provide access badges to individual contractor employees at government expense or it may require the contractor to provide badges to its employees, at its expense.  The contractor is responsible for ascertaining and complying with the procedures established by each installation on which it does business.  
6.  Denial of Access:  The Commanding General of each installation has broad authority to remove or exclude any person in fulfilling his responsibility to protect personnel and property, to maintain good order and discipline, and to ensure the successful and uninterrupted performance of the Marine Corps mission.  In the exercise of this authority, the Commanding General may refuse to grant access or may bar contractor employees, including employees who have previously been granted access.  Refusal to grant an employee access or barment of an employee does not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility to continue performance under this contract.  Among other reasons, access may be denied if it is determined that an employee:	a.    is on the National Terrorist watch List.	b.    is illegally present in the United States.c.	is subject to an outstanding warrant.d.	has knowingly submitted an employment questionnaire with false or fraudulent  information.	e.    has been issued a debarment order and is currently banned from military installations.
7.  Employee Identification:  Contractor personnel performing work under this contract shall be readily identifiable as an employee of the contractor through the use of uniforms or nametags, or via an alternate method approved by the Contracting Officer. 
8.  Employee Compliance.  The Contractors employees shall observe and comply with all MCAGCC/MAGTFTC rules and regulations applicable to contract personnel, including those applicable to the safe operation of vehicles, and shall not be present in locations not required for the proper performance of this contract. Contractor personnel and equipment entering a military installation are subject to security checks. Contractor personnel shall follow any direction given by military police, law enforcement, or other security or safety personnel.
9.  Contract Termination:  The Contractor is responsible for ensuring clearances, permits, passes, or security badges are promptly returned to the issuing activity upon termination of an employee, completion of a project, or termination of a contract or subcontract.  
Offerors shall submit past performance and experience information. The offeror must provide the information requested for past performance evaluation or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  Relevant contracts include those held within the past three (3) years with civilian and/or Government agencies for similar types of work.  Offerors submitting no past performance information will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  However, the proposal of an offeror with no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral in past performance, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposal of other offerors.  Past performance information shall demonstrates how well the Offeror satisfied its customers on previous contracts and shall  include name(s) for points of contact, telephone numbers, email address, contract number (if any), contract price, period of performance, years performed and any unique qualities of the contract.  
EVALUATION.The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible quoter whose quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotations:
1) lowest price technically acceptable2) delivery
The Contractor shall certify that it is a Manufacturer Authorized Channel Partner as of the date of the submission of their offer, and that it has the certification/specialization level required by the Manufacturer to support both the product sale and product pricing, in accordance with the applicable Manufacturer certification/specialization requirements.

FAR Clauses: 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications (JUN 2008), (Beginning January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) will require the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process.  ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations.  With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process.  You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes.  To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your companys ID and password into ORCA. (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN).  The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA.  Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions.  The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses.  The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully.  The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions.  You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission.  You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status.  Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help). 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders within this clause, the following clauses apply: 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities, 52.222-26 Equal Opportunity, 52.222-35, Affirmative Action for Disabled Veterans and Vietnam Era, 52.222-36 Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities, 52.222-37 Employment Reports on Disabled Veterans and Veterans of the Vietnam Era, 52.222-19 Child Labor--Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies, 52.225-13 Restriction on Certain Foreign Purchases, 52.232-33 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer --Central Contractor Registration, 52.232-18-Availability of Funds, 52.247-34, F.O.B.

<DESC>Liberia: Greater Monrovia Fiber Optic Ring Feasibility Study

POC Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009.  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE; PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: Mr. Ben Wolo, Managing Director, Liberia Telecommunications Corporation, Telecommunications Building, Lynch Street, PM Bag 9039, 1000 MONROVIA 10, Liberia, Phone: (231) 7777 3978, Fax: (231) 7722 6356.  

Liberia: Greater Monrovia Fiber Optic Ring Feasibility Study.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a Feasibility Study for the Liberian Telecommunications Corporation (LTC). 

Over the last five years, Liberia has worked steadily to rebuild the infrastructure and institutions destroyed by 14 years of civil war. The democratically elected government, headed by Africa’s first female president Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, has implemented significant reforms to rebuild the economy, reduce poverty, and invite foreign investment. As evidence of its progress, Liberia has cleared its obligations to the International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and African Development Bank over the past 16 months, allowing the country to receive much needed financial support from international institutions.

In the telecommunications sector, Liberia has made great strides in creating a platform for investment. Their implementation of key structural and policy reforms, including the creation of a regulatory authority in 2006 and the passing of a telecommunication policy in 2007, has liberalized the sector and encouraged competition and private investment. The expected result is an increase in the quality and availability of ICT services for the people of Liberia. 

While a vibrant mobile telephone market has developed in Liberia, the fixed line network is almost nonexistent, having been destroyed during the fighting. The absence of a backbone and local access infrastructure forces Liberia to depend on high-cost satellite links for internal and external connectivity. 

To rectify this situation, the state-run LTC plans to develop a fiber optic ring around the city of Monrovia and through its suburban areas, using the existing right of way belonging to LTC. The ring would allow LTC to become a “carrier’s carrier,” meaning the network would be available for use by existing telecommunications operators. The ring would also allow LTC to provide fixed line services directly to government agencies and the private sector.  This project is a key component of the LTC revitalization program launched by the government in 2006. It would be the first step in LTC’s future plans to build a National Fiber Backbone connecting the major cities of Liberia and would lay the groundwork for linking the country to one of the planned regional submarine fiber optic cables.  

Though the stated goal of Liberia’s telecommunications policy is to promote “fair and effective competition,” the newly installed government lacks expertise on organizing the sector to attract private investment. The Feasibility Study will design business models that encourage open competition and lay the groundwork for LTC’s eventual privatization. The contractor will also offer training to stakeholders, including the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications and the Liberian Telecommunications Authority, on structuring an IT market to attract private sector investment, so that LTC can expand their market presence in a manner that encourages private sector entrance and expansion in the sector.  

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $303,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:  https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp.   Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 p.m. on September 5, 2008 at the above address.  Please note that the Grantee will not respond to inquiries regarding the Proposal or Project after 15 days of this announcement. Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Rome has a requirement to provide life cycle software development engineering to the Department of Defense Intelligence Information System (DoDIIS) and the US Intelligence Community worldwide.  An indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity cost-plus-fixed-fee (completion) type contract is contemplated with an ordering period of 36 months.

Performance includes studies, analyses, designs, development, recommendations, enhancements, integration management, configuration management, testing and evaluation of existing and new systems, and their transition into the operational environment, software and hardware installation, the generation of technical documentation, and system and network administration/operation to maintain and develop improved capabilities for the U.S. Intelligence Community including the Air Force, Defense Intelligence Agency, Unified and Major Commands and their subordinate units, and other members of U.S. Intelligence Community.  Technical activities will include, but not be limited to:  imagery analysis, analytical studies, system feasibility studies, requirements definition/analysis, design, development, implementation, demonstration, systems engineering, integration, installation, site support, configuration management, quality control, familiarization, integration/interoperability/security testing, security engineering, engineering support, system and network administration/operation and testing for the maintenance of existing and the development and transition of new Department of Defense Intelligence Information System (DoDIIS) and Intelligence capabilities, and the generation of technical documentation detailing the above activities. In the course of performance, the Contractor will interface with at various agencies at various DODIIS and U.S. Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) Community sites worldwide via short term visits and electronic means in the Washington DC area, Hampton VA, and U.S. Intelligence Community sites worldwide including Iraq, Afghanistan, Kuwait, Bosnia, and Cuba and other hazardous locations.

In accordance with AFFARS 5301.91, an Ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. Before consulting with an Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the Contracting Officer, Lori L. Smith, (315) 330-1955, Lori.Smith@rl.af.mil, for resolution. AFFARS Clause 5352.201-9101 Ombudsman (AUG 2005) will be incorporated into the resultant contract. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the Ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The Ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. Consulting an Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions). If resolution cannot be made by the Contracting Officer, concerned parties may contact the following AFRL Ombudsman: Susan Hunter, Building 15, RM225, 1864 4th Street, Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433-7130 FAX: 937-255-5036 COM: 937-255-7754. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the AFRL level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force Ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067. The Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency. Do not contact the Ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contract Specialist.

The draft Request for Proposal is expected to be posted for review and comment by potential offerors by the first (1st) quarter of the Government fiscal year 2009. The solicitation is expected to be released within the first (1st) quarter of the Government fiscal year 2009. When it is issued, the entire solicitation will be issued on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website at https://www.fbo.gov.  All prospective offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of all other information pertaining to this solicitation. 

While the Small Business Specialist, Janis Norelli, is the focal point for receipt of the statements of capabilities, technical questions should be directed to the Laboratory Program Manager, Christopher Stepanick, 315-330-3590, or e-mail Christopher.Stepanick@rl.af.mil. Contractual questions should be directed to the Contract Specialist, Marlene Hueber, 315-330-4552, or e-mail Marlene.Hueber@rl.af.mil.

Title: Mass Spectrometer
 
Description(s): 

THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability and capability of small businesses (including certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged, and HUBZone firms; veteran and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and women-owned small businesses. This notice is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, a Request for Proposals, Solicitation, Request for Quotes, or an indication the Government will contract for the items contained herein. This notice is not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted as a result of this notice. The Government does not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred to interested parties for responses to this sources sought. Any responses received will not be used as a proposal. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is seeking to identify any sources with capabilities of providing a Mass Spectrometer in accordance with the following specifications:

A  triple quadrupole mass spectrometer system to support development of methods and
analytical tasks. The system in question will be used in the development of quantitative and qualitative methods for the analysis of food additives and contaminants. The instrument in question must be capable of obtaining full scan mass spectra, as well as tandem mass spectra (known asMS/MS spectra) in the product ion, parent ion and constant neutral loss mode. It must also have the capability to perform true reaction monitoring, in which the instrument can be set up to admit a precursor ion, fragment it, and sequentially monitor selected product ions as the mass spectrometer is stepped from one product ion to the next (see specifications below). The instrument must have multiple sources, including but not limited to an ESI and APCI source.

Instrument specifications:
Programmable drying gas temperature: The mass spectrometer must utilize
temperature programmable drying gas temperature which can be manipulated
throughout a chromatographic run. I am interested in degrade with increased temperature and others need higher drying gas temperatures to be efficiently ionized, a system which incorporates temperature programmable drying gas is essential.

Single tune file: In order to be the most robust and simple analyzer possible, the
instrument must use one tune file for both the optics and analyzer. Multiple tune
files make for complex analysis conditions for the operator. A single tune file
will allow me to be more efficient with my time.

Instrument footprint: In order to maximize bench space the mass spectrometer
must utilize an 180o collision cell and must have dimensions of not more than 15
in/38 cm (h) x 19.5 in/50 cm (w) x 28 inch/71 cm (d). Bench space is critical in
the lab, and any extra space made available will contribute to the productivity of
the lab.

Ion sources: The mass spectrometer must also come equipped with both an
Atmospheric Pressure Chemical Ionization (APCI) interface as well as an
Electrospray Ionization (ESI) interface. As not all compounds are responsive to
ESI, an APCI interface is absolutely necessary for our types of analyses.
Lenseless design: The mass spectrometer must utilize a lensless design for the
analyzer. The curved collision cell and lensless analyzer design increase
sensitivity by reducing chemical noise in the mass spectrometer and increasing
ion transmission. Both of the features increase the overall sensitivity of the
instrument.

Flexibility: To have the most flexible system available, the mass spectrometer
must be able to be converted by the lab personnel from an LC/MS/MS to a
GC/MS/MS with an optional interface kit.

Companies are encouraged to respond if they have the capability and capacity to provide the identified services with little or no disruption of services to the current users at the FDA. Interested small business potential offerors are encouraged to respond to this notice. However, be advised that generic capability statements are not sufficient for effective evaluation of respondents' capacity and capability to perform the specific work as required. Responses must directly demonstrate the company's capability, experience, and/or ability to marshal resources to effectively and efficiently perform each of the tasks described above at a sufficient level of detail to allow definitive numerical evaluation; and evidence that the contractor can satisfy the minimum requirements listed above wile in compliance with FAR 52.219-14 ("Limitations on Subcontracting"). Failure to definitively address each of these factors will result in a finding that respondent lacks capability to perform the work. Responses to this notice shall be limited to 15 pages, and must include: 

1. Company name, mailing address, e-mail address, telephone and fax numbers, website address (if available), and the name, telephone number, and e-mail address of a point of contact having the authority and knowledge to clarify responses with Government representatives.
2. Name, title, telephone number, and e-mail addresses of individuals who can verify the demonstrated capabilities identified in the responses. 

3. Business size for NAICS 334516 with size limitation standards of $6.5M and status, if qualified as an 8(a) firm (must be certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA), Small Disadvantaged Business (must be certified by SBA), Woman-Owned Small Business, HUBZone firm (must be certified by SBA), and/or Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (must be listed in the VetBiz Vendor Information Pages). 
4. DUNS number, CAGE Code, Tax Identification Number (TIN), and company structure (Corporation, LLC, partnership, joint venture, etc). Companies also must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at www.ccr.gov to be considered as potential sources. 

5. Identification of the firm's GSA Schedule contract(s) by Schedule number and contract number and SINs that are applicable to this potential requirement are also requested. 6. If the company has a Government approved accounting system, please identify the agency that approved the system. Please submit copies of any documentation, such as letters or certificates to indicate the firm's status (see item #3 above). To the maximum extent possible, please submit non-proprietary information. Any proprietary information submitted should be identified as such and will be properly protected from disclosure.

<DESC><p>The U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA, intends to purchase the following items from Systems With Reliability Limited Partnership (SWR): 4 each Antenna, 4-Bay, NWR Transmitter, Uses EIA Connector for use with Heliax Cable) SWR P/N WRX/4, NSN: 5985-01-4508663 and 8 each Antenna, NWR Transmitter, 8 Bay, w/Power Divider, Phasing Harness, Mounting Brackets, SWR P/N WRX/8 (Uses EIA Flange Connector for use with Heliax Cable) NSN: 5985-01-450-4482. This item is proprietary to Systems With Reliability Inc. and is considered the only source of supply. These antennas will be used as replacements for existing antennas currently in use as needed due to failure and/or damage. A direct replacement must be used due to the engineering studies that have been done to evaluate and approve the initial installation of these specific models on a per radio tower basis. The initial installations have had to be approved based on wind loading, weight, attachment method, and size. If another model antenna was used to replace the original it would negate the accuracy of the engineering study for that radio tower and could create a liability to the Government. If a change is mandatory another engineering study (at an additional expense to the Government) would be required and approval for the change of the antenna would be not be guaranteed. Because the Government does not have the manufacturer's drawings for this part, it would not be economical to attempt to re-procure this part as a "build-to-print". Therefore, it is recommended to purchase the item by part number. This item is being purchased for the National Weather Service (NWS), to be delivered to the National Logistics Support Center, Kansas City, MO. The intended procurement is for supplies for which the government intends to acquire under the guidelines of FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions Procedures. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one known source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b). However, all proposals received within 10 calendar days after the date of publication of this notice will be considered by the Government. This is not a request for proposals and there is no solicitation available at this time. The Government reserves the right to solicit bids based on the receipt of affirmative responses to this notice or issue an order to SWR, whichever is determined to be more advantageous to the Government without further notice. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. In order to be considered, firms must furnish detailed information concerning their capability to provide this product.

<DESC><p>***NOAA's Acquisition &amp; Grants Office, Mountain Region Acquisition Division, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Tyco Electronics Corporation, 2800 Fulling Mill Rd, Bldg. 38, Middletown, PA 17057-3142 for the purchase of an ROV tether and reel.
<p>***The sole source determination is based on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) requirement for a cable to be used as a replacement for the existing cable. This cable is used as a tether for the ROV on the Okeanos Explorer. Specifically, no other vendor can meet the NOAA requirement with these unique specifications: the design of the power conductors in this tether cable with respect to voltage capacity of 3600 is required and this cable uses a unique Electro-Light type fiber/electrical conductor which allows a small diameter in the cable and minimizes the weight. Tyco has designed this cable which was slightly modified from cable used for the same purpose by Woods Hole Oceanographic and has a proven reliable track record. Cable designs using individual power conductors that are entirely separate from the single mode fibers, single mode fibers encapsulated in steel tubing, or single mode fibers not physically incorporated into the power conductor assembly will not be considered for this application. As a result, Tyco is the only authorized manufacturer of this tether</p>
<p>***This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe they can provide equipment that fully meets the Government's requirements may submit substantiating documentation in writing to the identified point of contact within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Such documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD), Special Communication Requirements (SCR) Division is surveying the commercial vendor community for all interested parties in a proposed requirement for a Contractor Operated Parts Store (COPARS) solution in support of NAWCAD, SCR Integration Facility (SCRIF), at St. Inigoes, MD, with the possibility of eventually expanding the COPARS solution across the entire SCR Division.  The SCRIF is best characterized as an engineer-to-order manufacturing facility.  Each project is custom built to the engineering specification provided by the SCR Division technical project lead.  The typical functions being performed by the SCRIF are: 1.  Inventory and material management functions for the current integration project 2.  Sourcing decisions regarding method of procurement  3.  Generation of technical requirement requests when material substitution is required  4.  Overall management of the integration project 5.  Final test and evaluation prior to project delivery 

The NAICS code is 335999. The Contractor shall provide all equipment, material, supplies, supervision, administration, labor, transportation, and qualified personnel to accomplish the total work effort to execute a fully functional COPARS operation.   The Government is contemplating a multi-year supply contract for a base period of two years with three one-year options. Labor Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs), for one full-time equivalent (FTE), would be firm-fixed price for the base years only. Material CLINs would be fixed-price and an economic adjustment clause will be included for price adjustment in the outyears, as needed.  It is the Government’s intent to eliminate the Labor CLIN after the initial base year; it is the Government’s belief that the cost of the one FTE, separately covered under the base year, can be absorbed or built into the unit cost of each item based on the outyears anticipated volume.

<DESC>This is a sources sought synopsis for written information from all parties, especially small and small disadvantaged firms, interested in the upcoming acquisition for operation and maintenance services at King Salmon Forwarding Operating Location (FOL), Alaska. The information is requested for market research and is not a solicitation announcement for proposals. No contract will be awarded from this announcement. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests. There is no solicitation available at this time. Responses should focus on your firm’s technical and financial capability to provide technical and management services for the operation and maintenance of King Salmon FOL, as described below. You should address the contracting officer’s interest items on (i) Statement of Objectives (SOO) v. Performance Work Statement (PWS), and (ii) commercial practices. Standard publicity brochures are not particularly desired. Responses to this synopsis will be used for market research to determine under what, if any, set aside procedures this acquisition will be conducted. The contractor shall be responsible for operation and maintenance of Air Force facilities at King Salmon FOL, Alaska. Duties include (partial list) airfield management, operations, and maintenance; on-site management; environmental services; equipment and facilities repair; fire protection; power production; water treatment and distribution systems; heating systems; roads and grounds (incl. snow removal); fuels management; weather support; and visitor support services (lodging, food, etc.). The Government will probably issue the solicitation in the late fall of 2008, with award in the August - September 2009 time frame and with performance to begin on 1 October 2009. The current and previous contracts were set aside under the 8(a) competitive program, but the Government solicits capability statements and expressions of interest and intent from small businesses. Given the great complexity of the mission and the broad expertise required in addition to particular expertise in airfield management, please include information as to the size of your business and any planned teaming arrangement. Small business (including veteran-owned, service-disabled veteran-owned, HUBZone, disadvantaged, and women-owned, and other small businesses) are particularly invited to respond to express interest in submitting a proposal and to provide information as to their qualifications. The current contract was acquired with SIC 8744, Facilities Support Management Services. The corresponding NAICS is 561210, Facilities Support Services. The corresponding size standard is $23M (size standard will increase ot $35.5M as of 18 Aug 08. The current contract’s Performance Work Statement (PWS) is attached for industry comments. The contracting officer invites comments from industry as to whether using a SOO would encourage or discourage firms, especially small businesses, from submitting an offer. Under the SOO approach, the Government would issue a SOO as part of its solicitation. The SOO would broadly describe the top-level requirements allowing industry maximum flexibility to propose innovative and cost effective methods to meet those objectives. The previous acquisition for this requirement was not accomplished under FAR Part 12 because of the complexity and type of contract terms and conditions. However, responses to this synopsis will be used to assist the contracting officer to determine whether the upcoming acquisition can be accomplished under Part 12. Interested firms should submit information on their experience, capabilities, and resources to satisfactorily perform the mission as stated in the PWS. Capability statements of up to 15 pages in length may be submitted to the contracting officer, Della Simmons, 3CONS/LGCZ, 10480 22nd Street, Elmendorf AFB, AK 99506, and are requested by 24 September 2008.

<DESC>These wells are located in historically underserved areas approximately 100km north of Araouane (2 wells), and 45km north of Timbuktu (3 wells).  Due to the lack of water sources, these wells are natural meeting places and fall along lines of trafficking of men, weapons, and equipment moving across Mali.  The wells were built by the US in 1980s.  This project is the number one priority for the nomads and adding a wall and watering trough would increase the ease of watering the camel caravans as well as protecting the well from contamination.  Second order effect GWOT would be access and placement for DOD elements in addition to combating a serious civil vulnerability that makes that population more susceptible to EVO influence and recruitment.  CMSE has coordinated and deconflicted with USAID Mali and the West African Water Initiative to ensure project is consistent with USAID Program and Strategy the Theater Cooperation Plan and stated Goals number 2 and 3 of the Mali MSP.<BR><BR>The contractor shall furnish all labor transportation materials equipment and services necessary to build the walls and trough around the well.  Updates should include a one meter wall one meter from the well, a trough extending out from the wall and an updated pulley system to remove the water from the well.

<CONTACT>Michael E. Allen, Phone 7704882856, Email MEAllen@cdc.gov
<DESC><p>This is a Special Notice of intent to award a sole source contract. This is not a solicitation or request for quote.
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC) acting for the Coordinating Center for Environment Health and Injury Prevention (CCEHIP) intends to award a sole source, firm fixed-price contract to the Hektoen Institute for Medical Research, 2100 West Harrison Street, Chicago, Illinois, 60612.</p>
<p>Originally, the Government issued a sole source notice posted on FEDBIZOPS May 22, 2008 through June 24, 2008 for the same services and received no capability statements from alternative sources. Subsequently, in an effort to ensure CDC completed the most extensive market research, CDC posted a Sources Sought notice from July 24, 2008 through July 31, 2008. Hektoen submitted the only response. Therefore, the Contracting Officer has confirmed that in fact Hektoen is the only source capable of satisfying the Government's requirement described in the attached statement of work. <br />The purpose of the proposed sole source contract to Hektoen is to provide a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) of Routine Screening for Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) to be conducted by the Collaborative Research Unit at Stroger Hospital. Before IPV can be prevented, research is needed to figure out how big the problem is, where it is, and whom it affects. CDC learns about a problem by gathering and studying data. This data is critical because it helps decision makers use resources where they are needed most. The Collaborative Research Unit at Stroger Hospital is part of a unique forerunner program located in an inner-city public hospital that is a national model for hospital-based domestic violence services and training. The program provides direct services to victims of abuse that include crisis intervention, safety assessment and planning, individual counseling, information about legal rights, court and systems advocacy, access to emergency shelter, financial assistance and referrals to other needed resources. The Collaborative Research Unit possesses the unique conditions and extensive experience for implementing this RCT given their relationship as a partner with a medical school, their highly experienced and qualified epidemiology research unit, high patient load and a renowned IPV advocacy program. These conditions are critical to adequately follow Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved procedures for data collection. CDC anticipates soliciting and negotiating with only one source under the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) permitting other than full and open competition in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1 - Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Hektoen Institute for Medical Research is the only source available to provide services that meet mission critical requirements.</p>
<p>Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on August 8, 2008 Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. All responses shall be submitted via email to MEAllen@cdc.gov with the reference RCT for IPV Screening CDC-2008-52592-2 referenced in the subject line.</p>

<DESC><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Viral Hepatitis, HIV/Aids, STD and TB Prevention, Division of STD Prevention has a need for the use of empirical data in an individual-based stochastic simulation model of C. trachomatis transmission to:
<p>(1) Compare the relative reductions in Chlamydia prevalence of screening at random and differential screening uptake;<br />(2) Examine robustness through comparison with an independent individual-based model; and<br />(3) Determine whether there are thresholds for screening uptake and screening interval.</p>
<p>The contractor shall perform the following tasks:</p>
<p>Use empirical data in an individual-based stochastic simulation model of C. trachomatis transmission to compare and document reduction in Chlamydia prevalence after 5 and 10 years of the annual offer of screening in a fixed percentage of: <br />a.) randomly selected women aged 15-24 years each year<br />b.) fixed percentage of the same women aged 15-14 years each year; and<br />c.) differential uptake according to age, ethnic group, previous screening test uptake, but where overall average uptake is the same as in the previous scenarios.</p>
<p>(2) Compare and document reduction in Chlamydia prevalence after 5 and 10 years of the annual offer of screening at different levels of uptake and different average screening interval; and compare some outputs and explore and document reasons for differences.</p>
<p><br />The Government intends to procure from only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The University of Bern, Switzerland is identified as the expert with extensive experience in the area of Chlamydia screening and transmission.</p>
<p>This is not a request for competitive proposals, nor is a solicitation available. Any firm that believes it can furnish the items described above is encouraged to give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 15 days of the date of this synopsis. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements.

<DESC><p>SUBJECT: Z---CONTRACT CEILING INCREASE SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION FOR BASE ENGINEERING REQUIREMENTS (SABER) Bolling AFB, Washington, DC 20332
<p>CONTRACT: F49642-03-D-0010</p>
<p>POC: WILLIAM H. DAVIS, PH: (202) 767-7872</p>
<p>DESC: NOTICE OF CONTRACT ACTION: The purpose of this synopsis is to announce the intent of the Air Force to negotiate, on a sole source basis in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, an increase in the contract ceiling and amount of the SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION FOR BASE ENGINEERING REQUIREMENTS (SABER) contract F49642-03-0010 located at Bolling AFB, Washington, DC. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, nor is it to be construed as market research; however, it is issued to mitigate unacceptable delays to agency's requirements. No solicitation package will be issued or accepted. The current contract for which this notice is issued, is an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity firm-fixed price contract that was competitively awarded in September 2003. Accordingly, the action herein stated will increase the ceiling by $6 million, effectively changing the Not-To- Exceed contract value from $25 million to $31 million. This contract was awarded with a one year base period and four one-year option periods. This contract will expire on 4 Sept 2008; however, it is necessary to extend the contract and increase the ceiling to provide SABER support to the 11th Civil Engineering Squadron for end of year requirements and Air Force District of Washington's National Capitol Region relocation projects resulting from the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure initiative (BRAC). The BRAC initiative was not known at the time of the solicitation and award, and therefore has placed an extraordinary strain on this SABER contract from FY 2006 to present. Increasing the ceiling to $31 million will provide continued and seamless support of critical on-going and future projects at Bolling AFB, thereby supporting our customer's requirements until the recently solicited Bolling/Andrews AFB joint SABER Contract is awarded. All work to be performed under this contract ceiling increase has been determined to be in scope and in accordance with the original contract Statement of Work. The contractor is Donley-Kirlin Joint Venture, the awardee of this current contract solicited and awarded under competitive guidelines in 2003. The incumbent contractor is the only source available with the expertise to allow for effective and efficient continuation of effort pending award of the competitive follow-on contract. Any questions regarding the above requirements should be submitted in writing via fax or email to the Points of Contact listed below.</p>

<DESC><p>This publication serves as notice of intent to procure services for the Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SFSC) located in La Jolla, CA on a sole source basis with Moss Landing Marine Laboratories.  The government intends to acquire services using FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  Contractor will provide SWFSC with field collections, observations and measurements of fish and jellyfish for validation of modeled and measured acoustic scattering spectra data and development of algorithms for remotely identifying these organisms. This project involves development of a multiplexed, multi-frequency, down- and side-looking acoustic system, coupled with a single-frequency multi-beam to identify and enumerate coastal pelagic fish species (CPS) and jellyfish close to the sea-surface, and validation of the results with visual, optical, and net-tow observations. Moss Landing Marine Laboratories<br />will provide the validation data using ex situ experimental laboratory measurements, in situ field collections, and in situ observations.  The Contractor will travel to SWFSC to perform the ex-situ acoustic target strength (TS) measurements of live tethered CPS and jellyfish at 5 frequencies (18, 38, 70, 120, and 200 kHz) using a specially designed focused array and 10 m deep seawater test tanks at Scripps Institution of Oceanography.  The Contractor, with SWFSC personnel assistance, will measure a minimum of four common CPS (anchovy, sardine, mackerel, and Chinook salmon), and two common species of jellyfish (Chrysaora fuscescens and Aurelia labiata) will be measured. The CPS and jellyfish sizes will be representative of the ranges common to the Pacific coast of the U.S. The CPS specimens will be collected by bait fishermen using purse seines, except for Chinook salmon which will be obtained from state and federal hatcheries. The jellyfish will be collected by SCUBA divers immediately before testing. The split-beam transducers will be suspended at the surface of the test tank, with a synchronized digital camera and strobe to record the animal orientations. For jellyfish, a thin monofilament loop will be fed dorso-ventrally through the bell of the animal then attached to a guideline at 5 m beneath the transducer array. The loop will permit the jellyfish to tilt and rotate and thus will allow for varying acoustic returns as would be observed under natural conditions. A calibration sphere affixed to the end of the guideline will hold the line taut and provide a reference against which echoes may be calibrated (Brierley et al. 2004). Data for each animal will be recorded for approximately 20 min using Simrad ER60 software (1 ping s-1). Bell diameter, wet weight and volume of each jellyfish will be measured after completion.	The Contractor will contract and schedule a vessel, the MLML R/V John Martin, for conducting small-scale surveys of CPS and jellyfish, for six consecutive days approved by SWFSC during the period between July - Oct. 2008.  The Contractor will provide assistance to SWFSC personnel for mounting and installing the multi-frequency sonar system on the vessel.  The Contractor will deploy a Nordic rope trawl from the R/V John Martin, towed at the depth corresponding to the acoustic signatures of CPS and jellyfish.  The rope trawl will be deployed as described by MacFarlane et al. (2005) who used one to catch Chrysaora fuscescens and salmon.  Morphometrics of all CPS and jellyfish collected will be measured as previously described. Additionally, a digital video camera in an underwater housing will be towed at the depths of target scatterers, and SCUBA divers will make visual observations of jellyfish species, sizes, and depths.   The contractor will provide:  <br />1. A technician for laboratory measurements of scattering spectra. <br />2. Fish specimens collected by bait fishermen using purse seines, except for Chinook salmon which will be obtained from state and federal hatcheries. <br />3. Jellyfish specimens collected by SCUBA divers. <br />4. Measurements of scattering spectra of live tethered CPS (anchovy, sardine, mackerel, and Chinook salmon) and jellyfish (Chrysaora fuscescens and Aurelia labiata) at 5 frequencies (18, 38, 70, 120, and 200 kHz), using the SWFSC's focused array in SIO's deep tank. <br />5.   Measurements of the size, wet weight and volume of each fish and jellyfish.  <br />6.  The vessel, MLML R/V John Martin, for conducting small-scale surveys of CPS and jellyfish, for six consecutive days approved by SWFSC during the period of July - Oct. 2008.  <br />7.  Collections of fish and jellyfish made using a Nordic rope trawl from the R/V John Martin, towed at the depth corresponding to the acoustic signatures of CPS and jellyfish.  <br />8.  Morphometrics of all CPS and jellyfish collected. <br />9. Digital video camera and SCUBA diver observations of jellyfish species, sizes and depths. <br />The government intends to negotiate a firm- fixed price contract with a period of performance that will start from date of award and ends Dec 31, 2008.

<DESC>The US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity proposes to award to BioReliance, Rockville, MD on a sole source basis, for services to conduct stability test of two lots of Heptavalent Equine Botulism Antitoxins.  This is the only known laboratory in the U.S. that has developed validated stability test methods for this product. Testing at various laboratories can introduce variability in test results and render results open to interpretations.  In order to minimize inter-laboratory variability, it is prudent to test the antitoxin at one laboratory with validated methods.   This procurement shall be under other than full and open competition procedures in accordance with FAR 6.302-1.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This notice is not a request for a competitive quote.  Any response to this notice must be submitted in writing to the Government and show clear and convincing evidence that another source is capable of meeting the Governments requirements and that competition of the requirement would be advantageous to the Government.  If no written responses are received at least fifteen (15) days after the publication of this response, the purchase will be awarded without further notice.  The Point of Contact (POC) for this action is:  jennifer.jackson1@us.army.mil.

<DESC>The United States Marine Corps Systems Command is hosting the annual Tactical Radio Users Conference August 26-28, 2008 at the Fredericksburg Expo & Conference Center, VA; and requests participation from Industry to introduce their tactical vehicular intercom systems.  This is a request for information only.  This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and no contract will be awarded based on this RFI.
The purpose of this conference is to inform the multiple project offices and the Fleet Marine Force of capabilities of vehicular intercommunication systems that exist today to help develop the requirements for next generation of USMC vehicular intercom systems.  The Marine Corps invites vendors with material solutions based on the criteria listed below to attend and display their vehicular intercom system at the conference, and up to 10 vendors will be invited to brief the capabilities of their system at the conference.  
The Marine Corps is looking for vendors that have a rugged, modular, state-of-the-art tactical vehicle intercom system with the following desired capabilities:

This is not a solicitation for proposal nor obligates the government contractually in any way, but rather gives an opportunity for Industry to present the capabilities of their products and for the Marine Corps to develop an understanding of the new capabilities that exist.  Vendors will have booth space to demonstrate their product(s) and selected vendors will be provided an opportunity to brief their products.  All requests for attendance and as well as proposed briefing material must be submitted electronically to brandon.shaw@usmc.mil by 3:00pm Eastern Time 12 August, 2008.

<p>52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />1) Price<br />2) Past Performance</p>
<p>b) Past Performance is approximately equal to Price when being evaluated.</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>ADDENDA TO 52.212-2</p>
<p>BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD: This is a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) Set-Aside competitive selection in which competing offer or's past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis where past performance is approximately to price. By submission of its offer in accordance with the instructions provided in clause FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors, the offeror accedes to the term of this model contract and all such offers shall be treated equally except for their prices and past performance records. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>A. Initially, offers shall be ranked according to price. An offeror's proposed prices will be determined by multiplying the quantities identified in the Pricing Schedule by the proposed unit price for each Contract Line Item Number or Subcontract Line Item Number to confirm the extended amount for each.</p>
<p>B. Performance confidence assessments will be made using the complete questionnaires, submitted directly to the contracting officer on all offerors and data independently obtained from the government and commercial sources. Relevant performance includes performance efforts involving CCTV purchase and installation that is similar in magnitude and complexity than the effort described in this combined synopsis/ solicitation. Performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will be considered as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror. The government reserves the right to seek information on higher priced offerors if none if the lower priced offerors receive a "Satisfactory Confidence" or higher performance assessment rating. Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history shall receive the rating "Unknown Confidence", meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably. The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the government to assess the offeror's ability to perform the effort described in the solicitation, based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating as defined in AFFARS Mandatory Procedures 5315.3,Table 3. See Table below for rating and description ----</p>
<p>TABLE 3- PERFORMANCE CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENTS</p>
<p>Rating Description<br />Substantial Confidence-Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />Satisfactory Confidence-Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has an expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />Limited Confidence-Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort<br />No Confidence-Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />Unknown Confidence-No performance record is identifiable or the offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.</p>
<p>C. In evaluating past performance, the Government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.<br /><br />D. If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have a "Satisfactory Confidence" or higher performance rating, that offer represents the best value for the Government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.</p>
<p>E. If the lowest price offeror is not judged to have a "Satisfactory Confidence" or higher performance assessment, the next lowest priced offeror will be evaluated and the process will continue (in order by price) until an offeror is judged to have a "Satisfactory Confidence", or higher performance assessment or until all offerors are evaluated.</p>
<p>F. Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in the section entitled "Proposal Preparation Instructions". Offeror's may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal (for example, the relevance of past performance information) or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond. Adverse performance is defined as performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system. Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the contracting officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.<br /><br />G. The Government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors. The Government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest. If discussions are held, the Offerors will be required to respond to evaluation notices within a short time frame (24 hours or less).<br />(End of clause)</p>

Award to any other source or manufacturer will result in a failure to meet mission requirements and can NOT meet the Government's needs: after contacting manufacturers other than HAAS, I found that the option of merging manual machining and CNC machining is the latest technology and is not available through other manufacturers. The ability of a machine produced by HAAS to record the part fabrication process done by hand, (manual) and then be able to reproduce the same part repetitively, accurately and quickly by numeric control (CNC) alone is a capability not offered by any other manufacturer. This feature is only offered by HAAS.  In addition, other manufacturers offer CNC machines which require the user to know special codes in order to operate. This is training that the Army does not provide such as (G code).  The additional training costs associated with learning the codes represents needless expenses for the Government that we cannot justify when the HAAS machines are available without requiring the use of special codes.   HAAS incorporates the novice machinist into the CNC world of machining.  Through market research, three additional manufacturers of CNC machines were approached.  The manufacturers were Harding, Mazak and Clausing.   Ive determined thru research that HAAS offers the only American made equipment that has a common and integrated platform which is HAAS- specific unlike the three mentioned before. This is not a retrofit system i.e. some parts from Bridgeport, some parts from Fagor and some parts from Manford. HAAS eliminates the need to contact multiple support elements for maintenance, thereby reducing needless maintenance costs. HAAS also offers the only  machines comparable to the size that the Army requires in its effort to field a mobile machine shop. The other manufacturers offer machines of a larger size that do not support this effort, therefore negatively impacting the success of the Armys mission.<BR>

Lines are automatically calculated by word processing programs or other method approved by the Contracting Officer Technical Representative.  If contractor has provided a personal computer for use in sending completed reports, that personal computer will have the identical line-counting utility that is being used by the contractor to calculate lines transcribed so the line counts can be easily verified by the medical center staff.  Contractor must have been in the medical transcription profession and must have had a physical location which houses the majority of operational processes for at least the past one (1) year. Offers will be considered only from firms who are, in the judgment of the Contracting Officer, well-established in the transcription business, are financially responsible and able to show evidence of resources, experience and qualifications necessary to render services under the contract.

<DESC>Description
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued. This synopsis, NAICS code 541611, is to notify contractors that the government is seeking competition in accordance with FAR Part 13.106 for the following statement of work, under the simplified acquisition procedures and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 05-26.  This is a total small business set-aside.  Prospective offerors are responsible for downloading the solicitation and any amendments. It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the FedBizOpps website for the release of any amendments to this solicitation. Hard copies will be provided to individuals eligible under the Americans with Disabilities Act and Rehabilitation Act upon request. The Government reserves the right to award a contract without discussions if the Contracting Officer determines that the initial offer(s) is/are providing the Best Value and discussions are not necessary. 

STATEMENT OF WORK: Background:
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced in August 2003 its intention to make the agency’s animal feed safety program more comprehensive and risk-based.  The modernized Animal Feed Safety System (AFSS), which has a 2009 target completion date, will instill preventive control measures for ensuring the safety of animal feed and human food derived from animals (i.e., meat, milk and eggs).  FDA with State assistance is developing the AFSS Framework, the third draft of which was placed on the Center for Veterinary Medicine’s (CVM) web site in April 2008.  This document describes in detail the current processes, guidance, regulations and policy documents used by the FDA and the products that should be developed to meet the objective of having a more comprehensive, preventative and risk-based animal feed safety program in the United States.

Education and Outreach is an important component of the AFSS.  Developing “guidance” documents for use by our stakeholders (those impacted by changes in agency procedures, policies and regulations) is a key activity of the AFSS Team, the agency group working on the project. 

Duties:
The Contractor will provide advisory and consultative services to CVM on critical issues regarding those segments of the AFSS project that deal with the work products contemplated under the Process Control and Education and Outreach components.  Specifically, the Contractor will prepare guidance for industry (GFI) documents for three feed manufacturing types, ingredient, mixed feed and mixer-feeder.  Each GFI will explain what each establishment type will be required to perform to be in compliance with the requirements of the new process control regulations, which are being prepared by the AFSS Team for the Federal Register proposal step of the comment and rulemaking process.   Further, the Contractor will complete the paperwork impact section for the proposed regulation.  The contractor will be responsible for the timely drafting of documents, and their efficient revision based on comments from the AFSS Team.     

The Contractor should have extensive experience with the policies and procedures of the FDA, the legal processes within FDA, and voluntary compliance approaches.   Also, the Contractor needs wide-ranging knowledge of the regulatory and stakeholder groups that could be impacted by the guidance.  Furthermore, the Contractor must have a working knowledge of the feed industry as it currently exists and operates, as well as the goals, objectives and premises of the AFSS.  The Contractor will need to be available to travel on occasion. 

Location:
The work will take place at the Contractor’s office and occasionally at CVM, 7519 Standish Place, Rockville, MD.

Equipment Use:
No government equipment will be provided.

TECHNICAL EVALUATION FACTORS

Area 1 - Personnel

65 Points

Factors to be considered:

I.  Knowledge and experience of the contractor with regard to the regulation of the animal feed industry.  This is evidenced by specific narrative examples describing recent experience in the following:

a. developing guidance and program documents that address regulation of the animal feed industry;

b. writing regulations to ensure safety of animal feed; and,

c. how implementation of FDA’s animal feed safety system impacts safety of animal feed.   

II. The availability of contractor personnel to commit to the contract. This is evidenced by:

a. the amount of time the offeror has available to complete the project and the amount of time committed to competing work; and,

b. whether the offeror can rapidly ramp up to begin work on the project

Area 2 - Technical Understanding and Approach

35 Points

Provide a comprehensive statement of the scope and purpose of the project to demonstrate complete understanding of the intent and requirements.  This understanding indicates a clear comprehension and awareness of the contract’s objectives, specifically the development of the Paperwork Impact Assessment and the three guidance documents.

Objectives:  State the overall objectives and the specific accomplishments you hope to achieve.   Indicate the rationale for your plan, and the relationship to comparable work in progress elsewhere. 

Approach: Use as many subparagraphs as needed to outline clearly the general plan of work that specifically addresses the services in the Statement of Work (Attachment 1).

Methods: Describe in detail the methodologies that would be used for the project, indicating level of experience with each.  

Schedule: Describe on-site staff scheduling approach to the requirements to be performed during the business hours.  The contractor may propose alternate schedules such as staggering workday schedules to minimize overtime paid for weekend and holiday workers to develop more cost efficient methods for providing service.

Factors to be considered:

i. Knowledge and understanding of the Scope of Work is demonstrated by the clarity, practicality, and appropriateness of the offeror’s proposal and plan to accomplish the effort.
ii. Recognition by the offeror of potential difficulties in the performance of the project and plan to overcome such problems.

Period of Performance:
Twelve months from the date of award.

Work Hours
No specific work hours.

SECURITY REQUIREMENTS:
The Contractor shall obtain FDA security clearance prior to beginning work.  Contractor shall sign a confidentiality agreement prior to beginning work under this contract.

Objectives include: To generate guidance documents and paperwork impact assessment for a proposed progress control regulation for animal feed.  

Offerors are advised that award will be made to that offeror whose quotation provides the combination of features that offers the best or greatest overall value to the Government. The Government is more concerned with obtaining performance capability superiority rather than lowest overall cost. However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall cost to the Government to achieve only slightly superior performance. Overall cost to the Government may become the ultimate determining factor for award of a contract as quotations become more equal based on the other factors.  

BILLING:  The contract will be set up as an invoice.

CCR: Vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Register (CCR) prior to the award of a contract. You may register by going to www.ccr.gov. You will need your Dun & Bradstreet number and banking information. 

QUESTIONS DEADLINE: All questions are to be submitted via email to karen.petty@fda.hhs.gov no later than August 11, 2008, 3:00pm EST. 

QUOTATIONS DUE: All quotations are due, via email to: karen.petty@fda.hhs.gov, no later than 3:00pm, EST on Thursday, August 14, 2008.

Line Item 0001: Quantity Two (2) New Source Range Nuclear Instrumentation channels, which shall meet or exceed the following specifications:

Background

The NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR) reactor has been in continuous operation since it achieved initial criticality on December 7, 1967. The existing nuclear instrumentation is organized as three overlapping ranges of coverage, the Source Range, the Intermediate Range and the Power Range. The Intermediate and Power ranges were modernized in late 2004, and it is now time to replace the old Source Range equipment.

The current Source Range equipment uses 50-year-old technology. As a result of the modernization of the other ranges, the Source Range electronics takes up exorbitant amounts of rack mounting space needed for future overall control room upgrades, and utilizes high-power, inefficient power supplies that formerly powered the entire three-range system. Some components are no longer even manufactured, and many assemblies were essentially custom-built for the original National Bureau of Standards Reactor (NBSR). 

Objective

Replace the present Source Range electronics and mounting hardware with new, modern design equipment that is compatible with existing reactor controls and installed neutron detectors, and meet the specific performance specifications enumerated below.

Description

The Source Range nuclear instrumentation includes:  Two (2) boron neutron detectors, and two (2) coaxial cables that supply operating high voltage to the detectors from the Source Range electronics, as well as transferring the desired pulse signals from the detectors to the electronics for processing. The Source Range electronics consists, functionally, of two (2) separate, identical processing units that:

•	Provide high voltage operating power for the detectors.
•	Collect and process the detector pulse output signals.
•	Generate analog output signals representing the logarithm of the pulse count rate from the detector and the period of the detected pulse count rate.
•	Generate digital output signals representing analog signals that exceed adjustable setpoints for high period and for low count rate.
•	Generate a digital output signal whenever the electronics is not operational.
•	Accepts a digital input signal to turn off the high voltage supplied to the detector.

Additional, external electronics provides analog signal display and recording functions, combinatorial logic that processes the setpoint trip signals and provides reactor protective functions.

It is intended that the replacement electronics must be rack-mounted, first, in an interim movable short rack, so it can be stored outside the control room when not in use, and later, in the permanent electronics rack to be installed as part of a separate overall control room modernization program.


Specifications

Electronics unit must be mountable in a standard 19-inch equipment rack, and include pull-out slides with positive locks in the open, extended position, with screw slots for retention in the closed position.

Electronics must be compatible with a Reuter-Stokes boron-10 proportional counter neutron detector, model RS-P7-0812-117. Detectors have one (1) coaxial connector, type HN, used for both high voltage input and pulse signal output.

Electronics must include a variable-threshold pulse discriminator circuit to maximize neutron sensitivity in the presence of gamma flux.

Electronics must provide analog output signals representing Log Count Rate from 1 Count Per Second (CPS) to 1 X 105 CPS, and representing Reactor Period from -30 Seconds to +3 Seconds. Output signal may be a suitable voltage or current, but the most desirable  is “Current Loop” 4 mAmps to 20 mAmps; 4mAmps to represent 1 CPS and -30 Seconds, and 20 mAmps to represent 105 CPS and +3 Seconds. Corresponding front-panel analog and digital indications must be provided.

<SUBJECT>SEABIRD BYCATCH ESTIMATION & STOCK ANALYSIS SUPPORT
<SOLNBR>WC133F-08-RQ-0929SLW
<RESPDATE>081508
<CONTACT>Sharon L. Walker, Phone (816)426-7470, Email sharon.walker@noaa.gov
<DESC><p>The NMFS announces an opportunity for funding to conduct analyses of fishery and related data associated with (Task 1) the seabird bycatch of the western North Atlantic longline fishery and (Task 2) recruitment variation in the Tortugas pink shrimp fishery in relation to transport variables and juveniles on the Florida Bay nursery grounds. A prospective provider can respond to this announcement with respect to both tasks or to either task singly. Offerors for Task 1 will be favored that have experience working with the Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC) pelagic observer and logbook databases. Statisticians with demonstrated experience working with rare events also will be especially considered. Demonstrated training and experience in stock assessment are mandatory for selection as a provider of Task 2.</p>
<p>Seabirds: An estimate of the total seabird catch of the US North Atlantic pelagic longline fleet in 2007 is the immediate objective of this project. A second objective is to develop estimates of the total seabird catch in several previous years for comparison to previous estimates using another method. The limited and highly clustered distribution of the bycatch in the observer data in 2007 and some previous years present complications to estimation. It is anticipated that period-of-record data will have to be used to acquire a valid estimates. POP data have been collected since 1992. Logbook data also are available for that period. The recently implemented (August 2004) mandated change in gear use (i.e., prohibition of J-shaped hooks, leading to universal use of circle hooks) further complicates estimation based on the data record. Previous analysis suggests that seabird catches are lower on circle hooks in relation to effort with circle hooks, than would be expected by chance. There are nine fishing zones in the POP and logbook database. <br /><br />Pink Shrimp: The Tortugas shrimp stock, both on the fishing and spawning grounds and in other parts of its ontogenetic range, is the focus of this part of the procurement. This part of the procurement is to support a collaboration of the provider with other principal investigators in the FATE project being conducted by the Southeast Fisheries Science Center. The FATE project will integrate biology and oceanography into a series of models that will quantify the influence of coastal processes, weather, and water management on fishery production. Results will be used to develop physical and biological indicators of postlarval recruitment into Florida Bay and a fishery recruitment index for use in stock assessment. The role of this provider in the project will include (1) analysis of Tortugas pink shrimp catch and effort data and (2) participation in the integration of other information produced in the project into the analysis. Along with this involvement will be the major responsibility of providing guidance and advise to the other project scientists on the type and form of information that can most effectively improve estimates of stock status and projections of stock sustainability in the face of variability in environmental influences and fishing pressure.</p>
<p>DESC: The required work will consist of the following:</p>
<p>Analysis of databases on fishery catch and effort is a major component of this procurement.</p>
<p>Seabird Bycatch: SEFSC Pelagic Observer Program records will be analyzed and used to estimate total incidental takes of seabirds in the pelagic longline fishery. Observer Program stratification (fishing zones) will be followed as closely as practical. Zones in which no bird catches have been observed may be excluded. A Bayesian type of analysis and estimation method will be conducted. Total seabird catch per unit of effort and mortalities per unit of effort will be determined from observer reports through calendar year 2007. Analyses will be conducted to the lowest taxonomic group feasible, recognizing that this may be only "seabird" or "alive vs. dead" birds. Changes in the fishery (i.e., mandated change to exclusively use circle hooks, rather than either circle or j-shaped hooks), beginning August 2004, may complicate the analysis and reduce the number of years for which the total bird bycatch is estimated. Set is the effort unit to be used in the analysis. In previous work, which also used set as the effort unit, separated hauls were associated with sets based on start or end date and time of the haul. Set is a better measure of effort than hook because the hooks on a set are not independent from each other and often several birds are caught on the same set. Hooks and sets may be well correlated, however the relationship may differ spatially. The presentation of information should include bycatch rates in terms of hooks as well as sets because this is the form in which both scientists and managers are accustomed to seeing bycatch information. Ecological factors or fishery practices that lead to higher catches of certain species may also favor a bycatch of seabirds, and knowledge of associations should be developed and potentially exploited both to better estimate the seabird bycatch and possibly recommend approaches to decreasing the seabird bycatch.</p>
<p>Pink Shrimp: Ensuring the applicability of the products of an ongoing project that links pink shrimp recruitment to oceanographic factors and behavior through hydrodynamic and Lagrangian modeling will be the main responsibility of this provider. The provider will collaborate in the development of a 10-yr time series of recruitment indices and will examine the time series in relation to fishery data. In an iterative process with the other project scientists, the provider will determine the most potentially effective indices for predicting fishery recruitment and stock production. This will culminate in a design, to be described by the provider, for application of the information developed by the models into a stock-assessment framework. The provider will participate in preparing reports and deliverables that describe the appropriate application of the recruitment indices to stock evaluation.</p>
<p>The anticipated performance period is date of award through one year.</p>

FREQUENCY OF SERVICE – Complete mowing of all park facilities are required to begin no earlier than 22 September 08, with completion no later than 21 September 09.

HSAR 3052-70, PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [JUN 2006] [Full Text Follows] (a) Prohibitions. Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent’ for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. "Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held- (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. “Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. (d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) warrants; (ii) options; (iii) contracts to acquire stock; (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002. (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal. (End of provision) NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011. Anticipated award date is no later than 19 August 2008. Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 4 PM Eastern Time on 15 August 2008. PROPOSALS ARE TO REMAIN EFFECTIVE FOR 60 DAYS AFTER CLOSE OF SOLICITATION. Facsimile offers are acceptable and may be faxed to the Attention of: Dennis Gaines at 252-335-6790. Offers may be submitted on company letterhead stationery indicating the nomenclature; part number; unit price and extended price, FOB point; payment terms and any discount offered for prompt payment, the business size standard and any minority classification; delivery date, and Representation and Certifications contained in FAR Clause 52.212-3, including Alternate I.

<DESC>Questions posed:

Reference to Brand Name acquisition.
Minimum and Maximum sizes.
Who scrapes old machines.

Answers below:

Clarification of first paragraph line two.  The brand name refered to is only for section "Control Feature" of the statement of work where it asks for Panasonic FP-X Programmable Logic Controller or equvalent and also to section "Options required" where it asks for Allen Bradley MicroLogix 1500 PLC.

Correction to min / max size.  The statement of work section "Minimum Requirements" should read: Maximum Load Size: 50"Wx50"Lx82"H and Minimum Load Size: 30"Wx30"Lx24"H.

Clarification:  The contractor is only responsible to remove the old machines from the conveyor lines and install the new, the government will dispose of old machines, not the contractor.

This training provides participants the practical skills necessary to recognize, avoid, and respond to potential threats from terrorist organizations. This mission requires the use of pyrotechnics to replicate real world terrorist attacks that train State Department agents deploying to remote high risk location throughout the world.It is requested that the ECU procures the pyrotechnic devices from M.P. Associates as M.P. Associates is the only company who produces the items utilized in our training scenarios.The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C 253 (c) (2).  The regulatory authority is FAR 6.302-2, Unusual and compelling urgency to satisfy agency requirements.These pyrotechnic devices provide as close to realistic high threat situation as possible with minimal exposure of risk to the trainee. These pyrotechnic devices are essential to meet the mission requirements of the Explosives Countermeasures Unit.The Explosives Countermeasures Unit has conducted extensive research to identify additional vendors who might be able to satisfy the equipment requirements. Two other vendors; Firfox Pyrotechnics (208) 237 1976 and Lunatec Pyro Pac (256) 725 4224 were consulted as to the availability with negative results.The Contracting Officer has determined that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable based upon previously accepted and approved purchases for similar items that had been competitively bid and awarded.The Bureau expects to fully compete any new requirement that will include installations the Metropolitan Washington, DC area and the 8 DS Field Offices nationwide.<BR><BR>

<DESC>Description
THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. THE SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING FAR PART 13 SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES. 
***This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-24.***

*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334112.
This requirement is being competed on a total small business set-aside basis.
Description
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for the purchase of  the following:

1 system consisting of:

Video Data Collection Storage and Back-up System 55

    2 -  JetStor NAS 1000 with dual SCSI 1U single power  

    2 -  JetStor SAS 516S RAIDs with 2GB cache  qty 16  500GB drives

 Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) and Test Retrieval Conference Video Retrieval Evaluation (TRECVid) projects (supporting Information Technology Laboratory (ITL’s) Information Discovery Usage and Sharing Program (IDUS) Program).  These projects have many large text and video collections which are used for research and in conjunction with the evaluations run by the group. The loss of this data, some of which may not be available from other sources, would have major harmful affects on group operations. Currently this data is being backed up using the NIST Tivoli Storage Manager (TSM) system. Restoring a one-terabyte file system containing millions of files from TSM took several weeks and careful supervision by administrators as well as the TSM administrator in order to avoid crashing the TSM server.  TSM, as deployed at NIST Division 894 was not well-suited to restoring this kind of data.

By adding the requested NAS engines and RAIDS to our existing storage architecture with some reconfiguration we will be able to mirror our data to local storage. This will protect against the loss of valuable data. It will also allow for fast recovery in case of hardware failure up to and including automatic fail-over to the backup mirrors.

Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 does not apply to this procurement.	

*** The full text of a FAR provision or clause may be accessed electronically at http://acquisition.gov/comp/far/index.html. ***

<DESC>1. CONTRACT INFORMATION: 

Continuing a legacy of outstanding museum architecture, the Smithsonian Institution (“Smithsonian”) seeks to commission our nation’s most talented designers to design a facility of quality and value for the National Museum of African American History and Culture (“NMAAHC”).  This commission will demonstrate the value of a true integrated design that balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; while simultaneously creating an environmentally responsible and superior place for staff and visitors.  

Consequently, the Smithsonian desires to select an architectural and engineering firm (“A/E”) to provide architectural, engineering, planning and design support services for the Smithsonian’s new National Museum of African American History and Culture.  This procurement is conducted in accordance with the Brooks Architect-Engineer Act, as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Subpart 36.6, refer to Numbered Note 24 on FedBizOpps.com, and includes a conceptual design competition for selected firms.  The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) for this procurement is 541310.  This announcement is open to all businesses regardless of size.  The contract awarded will be firm-fixed-price.  Minority, Small business, Small disadvantaged business, Women-owned small business, Hub-zone small business, Veteran owned small business and Service Disabled Veteran owned firms are strongly encouraged to apply.  

2. NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY AND CULTURE:

The National Museum of African American History and Culture Act - Public law 108-184, signed by President Bush on December 16, 2003, established the National Museum of African American History and Culture, as the newest museum within the Smithsonian.  NMAAHC is the national museum for the study and exposition of African American history and culture.  Its primary purposes are to acquire, maintain and preserve objects which document social, cultural, political, military, technological and scientific developments in the United States; to conduct scholarly research designed to make significant contributions to the body of knowledge in the fields of African American history; to publish findings for both scholarly and general audiences; and to interpret historical developments through public exhibitions and programs.  

In January of 2006, the Smithsonian Board of Regents selected a site for the new building from one of four alternatives.  The site, located on the National Mall and the Washington Monument grounds, is bounded by Constitution Avenue and Madison Drive, between 14th and 15th Streets, NW.  The National Mall and the Washington Monument are both listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  

The National Park Service transferred administrative control of this symbolic, historic and prominent federal government owned site to the Smithsonian in June of 2007.  Tier I of the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”) Environmental Impact Statement (“EIS”) is underway and scheduled for completion in the summer of 2008.  Concurrent Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (“NHPA”) historic preservation review is also underway.  Tier II NEPA and the continued administration of the Section 106 NHPA review is expected to be completed at the end of the design phase.  Finally, the NMAAHC programming effort is also underway and scheduled for completion in the fall of 2008.  

NMAAHC will be approximately 350,000 square feet; and it is anticipated that A/E will have a maximum of three years to complete the NMAAHC design.  During this period, the A/E will also participate in the final approval process and produce an early release package for site development.

<DESC><p>Jones Lang LaSalle, a&nbsp;Privatization Real Estate Support Services (PRESS) Contractor, acting on behalf of the Air Force Housing Privatization Program Office - San Antonio, and the Headquarters Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) and Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), anticipates the release of its Request for Proposal (RFP) for the Privatization of Military Family Housing for the Eglin Air Force Base, Hurlburt Field and Edwards Air Force Base (E-H-E) project on 8 August 2008.</p>
<p>Jones Lang LaSalle intends to employ a one-step RFP process. In its proposal, each prospective Offeror (or Offeror team) will submit written evidence of its qualifications, experience, references and access to financial resources, financial strategy as well as a description of its technical approach to the&nbsp;E-H-E project as described in the RFP. Jones Lang LaSalle will evaluate proposals on the basis of evaluation criteria stated in the RFP and recommend a Highest Ranked Offeror (HRO) to the Air Force. The HRO will then begin negotiations with the Air Force and complete additional remaining submittal requirements needed for closing the real estate transaction. These additional submittal requirements are also identified in the RFP. The E-H-E project is a real estate transaction to privatize 2,620 military family housing units. The objective of this initiative is to provide quality management for the 2,620 unit housing community for a lease period of 50 years. The Government will lease the land. The existing 2,801 housing units, primary and secondary associated utility and infrastructure systems, and other improvements will convey by Quitclaim Deed to the Project Owner (PO). The Government may subsidize the project's financing as described in the RFP. The PO will obtain private sector debt and will be responsible for managing and operating the E-H-E family housing inventory for the duration of the lease. This transaction is not subject to requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). The RFP will be available by 8 Aug 08 at http://www.jllpress.com.</p>
<p>The Air Force's goal is to provide military families access to safe, quality, affordable, well-maintained housing in a community where they will choose to live. The project provides a unique opportunity for top quality firms to assist in the development, operations and financing of this family housing privatization effort.</p>

<DESC>Amendment 0001 is released.  The purpose of this amendment is to remove line item 30 (Maintenance Repair Parts) from the bid schedule to make option year 0001 consistent with the other two years.  In addition, all line items after 0014 are renumbered to accurately reflect the use of conventional numbering schemes.    

A bid schedule note is added stating that the emergency repair rate should equal the overtime rate (under the assumption that we will not pay overtime unless it is a necessity).

Clause 52.211-18 Variation in Estimated Quantity (Apr 1984) is added to the contract clauses section by full text.  The estimated quantity refers to the estimated annual usage of the equipment (see bid schedule notes).

<p>Original description below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DARPA is soliciting innovative research proposals in the area of NanoThermal Interfaces (NTI).  The primary goal of this program is the development and demonstration of ideas based on novel materials and structures that can provide significant reductions in the thermal resistance of the interface layer (often called the TIM) between the backside of an electronic device and the next layer of the package, which might be a spreader or a heatsink (this might be based on technologies developed in the DARPA-sponsored TGP and/or MACE programs, respectively).  In addition to reductions in the thermal resistance of the TIM, DARPA is interested in practical considerations, such as reliability, the ability to rework the interface, and application at modest temperatures and in conventional environments.  Additionally, DARPA is interested in concepts which can provide very high thermal conduction in the direction between the device and the spreader, while allowing shear due to differential thermal expansion between the device and spreader.  All administrative correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including requests for information on how to submit a proposal abstract or full proposal to this BAA, should be directed to one of the administrative addresses below; e-mail is preferred.  (BAA08-42@darpa.mil) . See attached full BAA.</p>

<SUBJECT>Survey data on Food Safety and Nutrition Concerns
<SOLNBR>FDA1046498
<RESPDATE>080808
<CONTACT>David - Kordel, Email david.kordel@fda.hhs.gov
<DESC>FDA1046498<p>

STATEMENT OF WORK<p>

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is seeking full and open competition to provide the FDA with historical survey data focusing on food safety and nutrition concerns and consumption intentions among U.S. consumers.<p>

<b>I.  Background</b><p>

The Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), regulates conventional foods, dietary supplements, and cosmetics.  These products are regularly used by the consumer and have important impacts on their health.  To help consumers make informed consumption choices, CFSAN uses various regulatory and educational approaches to promote the availability and usefulness of consumer information regarding food safety and nutritional characteristics of food products.  <p>

In order for CFSAN to make informed decisions, it is crucial that CFSAN keep abreast of consumer concerns about food safety and nutrition issues related to foods under CFSAN jurisdiction, such as mercury in fish or seafood, foodborne pathogens, acrylamide, and trans fat, and how the concerns may be related to consumption of food products.  In particular, CFSAN is interested in tracking and understanding consumer responses to several recent events.  These events include (1) the announcement, in March, 2004, by FDA and Environmental Protection Agency of a consumer advisory on methylmercury in fish, (2) the announcement, in July, 2003, by FDA of a regulation requiring declaration of trans fat contents on food labels, and (3) the release, in March, 2004, by FDA of test data on the chemical acrylamide in 750 food samples and an action plan.  These events attracted intense media attention and could be reasonably expected to change the levels of consumer concerns over time, which in turn could have led to changes in consumption of certain foods resulting in potential impacts on consumer health.  <p>

<b>II. Scope of work</b><p>

This requisition provides CFSAN with historical survey data of U.S. consumers’ concerns and  consumption intentions that are related to food safety and nutrition issues, including but not limited to (1) mercury in fish or seafood, (2) trans fat, (3) acrylamide, (4) foodborne pathogens, and (5) other food safety related issues.  The data must reflect consumer concerns and intentions before, during, and after certain major events.  The data must also have been collected continuously and with regular and frequent intervals to enable detection of short-term changes and long-term patterns of consumer concerns and consumption intentions.<p>

<b>III. Deliverables</b><p>

Within ten (10) calendar weeks from the award of the requisition, the Contractor shall deliver raw data files and related documentation such as data codes, survey instruments, and description of methodologies survey.  The data period shall cover six (6) years, from January 1, 2002 through December 31, 2007.<p>

The raw data files shall be (1) arranged so that each record uniquely identifies and corresponds to one respondent’s data; (2) coded as numeric values rather than character values; and (3) accompanied with documentation showing layout, codes and contents of the files.  The data shall include quantitative measures of consumer concerns and consumption intentions as well as individual background information, including but not limited to, gender, age, education, and race/ethnicity.  All personal identifiers, such as names, addresses, telephone numbers, shall be excluded from the raw data files.<p>
      
<b>IV. Period of Performance</b><p>

August 15, 2008 – December 16, 2008.<p>

<SUBJECT>Evaluation of Timeliness of Medical Update for Surveillance in Health Care Databases
<SOLNBR>FDA-SOL-08-MedicalUptake_HealthCareDatabases
<ARCHDATE>09192008

<DESC>The FDA intends to issue a Request for Quotations (RFQ) to examine two recent medical product launches each in at least two different types of health care databases to assess the timeliness of uptake of these products by patients in each database.


Consistent with FDA's mission to protect and promote the public health, the Agency is embarking on the Sentinel Initiative to create a national, electronic distributed network, strengthening FDA's ability to monitor the post-market performance of a product.  As currently envisioned, the Sentinel Initiative will enable FDA to utilize the capabilities of multiple, existing data systems (e.g. electronic health record systems, Medicare data, other medical claims databases) to augment the Agency’s current surveillance capabilities. The System will enable surveillance or queries of distributed data sources quickly and securely for relevant product safety information.  Data will continue to be managed by its owners, and only data of organizations who agree to participate in this system will be included. Operations will adhere to strict privacy and security safeguards.
 
The success of this Initiative will depend largely on the time it takes for medical products under surveillance to be used by sufficient numbers of patients in participating health care databases. It is essential that FDA understand the timeliness of the surveillance possible in the Sentinel Initiative.

The Sentinel Initiative is intended to be created through a public-private partnership involving a broad spectrum of stakeholders, including government agencies, data holders, academia, patients, consumers, and healthcare professionals.  The awardee will examine two recent medical product launches each in at least two different types of health care databases that could participate in the Sentinel Initiative in order to assess the timeliness of uptake of these products by patients in each database.  

This work will require a thorough analysis of two medical products launched within the past several years in at least two different health care databases for: (1) the number of patients identified as using each medical product each month in each health care database throughout the first year after launch; (2) a description of the patients using the product, and characteristics of that use (e.g., product strength, days supply and overall duration of use); (3) the time elapsed before 1 patient, 100 patients, 1000 patients, 10,000 patients and 100,000 patients could be identified in each database using these products; (4) identification of factors that influence the uptake of new medical products in each of the databases examined.  These analyses will be interpreted in the context of the population included and represented by the health care database to determine the generalizability of the findings to the nation as a whole.

These analyses should lead to specific recommendations for important characteristics or minimum criteria relating to medical product uptake that could be considered when evaluating health care data systems for inclusion as the Sentinel Initiative moves forward.


The anticipated Period of Performance is Six Months from date of award.  The anticipated award type is Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP).  There is no anticipated Set-Aside Designation.  Competition is expected to be “Full and Open.”  The anticipated Procurement Procedures are those proscribed by FAR Part 13 for Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  And, the anticipated Basis of Award is “Best Value.”

The primary location of performance is anticipated to be at the contractor’s preferred location; however, the contractor may be required to travel to the Washington, DC/Maryland geographical area.

The designated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is anticipated to be: 541690 – Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services. This industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in providing advice and assistance to businesses and other organizations on scientific and technical issues (except environmental).  The Small Business Size Standard is $6.5 Million.


This announcement is not a RFQ.  FDA anticipates release of the RFQ on or around August 9, 2008.  It will be available on the Federal Business Opportunities Web Site Home Page: http://fedbizopps.gov.


The anticipated quotation due date and award date for this effort is expected to be on or around September 2, 2008, and September 18, 2008, respectively.

STATEMENT OF WORK


1.	Title

2.	Background

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is the United States government's principal agency for protecting the health of all Americans and providing essential human services, especially for those who are least able to help themselves.  The Department oversees more than 300 programs covering a wide spectrum of activities.

	The HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs (OASPA) serves as the HHS Secretary’s principal public affairs policy advisor; to provide centralized professional leadership and continuous monitoring and evaluation of Department-wide policies, procedures and operating practices regarding public affairs activities; and to administer the Freedom of Information Act, Privacy Act and other information access statutes.
	
	The OASPA News Division plans, directs and coordinates the issuance of public information from HHS to the press and broadcast media, including preparing news releases, media advisories, fact sheets, and other news material for the Secretary and other top Department officials.

3.	Purpose 

The purpose of this procurement is to disseminate press releases for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

4.  Scope of Work

With HHS’ expanding media outreach activities, it has become necessary to have access electronically to a large database of media outlets, including journalists, health writers, columnists, trade press, and health care consumers.  HHS programs reach into communities large and small all across America and the Department needs to increase awareness of these services so that more people may benefit. By better targeting our news releases, we will be in a better position to monitor how well we are reaching the people our programs are intended to serve. 

On average the HHS/OASPA/News Division issues approximately 20 news releases, press statements, media advisories, and other time-sensitive media materials each month.  In addition, HHS/OASPA/News Division may issue 10-15 photo releases each year.  The HHS/OASPA/News Division requires the core capability to distribute these materials to a variety of media outlets, including journalists, health writers, columnists, trade press, and health care consumers, and to target special populations and regions of relevance to HHS initiatives and programs, including: 
•	Health and social science research 
•	Preventing disease, including immunization services 
•	Assuring food and drug safety 
•	Medicare (health insurance for elderly and disabled Americans) and Medicaid (health insurance for low-income people) 
•	Health information technology 
•	Financial assistance and services for low-income families 
•	Improving maternal and infant health 
•	Head Start (pre-school education and services) 
•	Faith-based and community initiatives 
•	Preventing child abuse and domestic violence 
•	Substance abuse treatment and prevention 
•	Services for older Americans, including home-delivered meals 
•	Comprehensive health services for Native Americans 
•	Medical preparedness for emergencies, including potential terrorism.


5.	Period of Performance

The period of performance shall be for Six (6) months from effective date of award with the potential of four additional Twelve (12) month option periods for a total of 54 months.


	6.	Tasks

The contractor shall complete the following tasks as identified below:

a.  Electronically mass distribute HHS press releases, press statements, media advisories, photo releases, and other media-related materials to newspapers, magazines, and national media outlets, targeting special populations and/or regions.

b.  Establish an on-line report to link HHS to the actual press release as it appears on web sites.

c.   Provide on-line media monitoring to deliver-up-to-the-minute stories from those outlets that mention HHS.

d.   Provide detailed real-time reports which show access to HHS press releases by journalists and others viewing them, plus a breakdown of access by media type, industry segment and region/country.

7.	Schedule of Deliverables

The contractor shall submit all items in the quantities and by the dates indicated to the Project Officer.

Deliverables 
Task        Description	      Quantity	            Due Date

The complete text of Section 508 Final Standards can be accessed at http://www.access-board.gov/news/508-final.htm.  The contractor shall indicate for each line item in the schedule whether each product or service is compliant or noncompliant with the accessibility standards at 36 CFR 1194. Further, the proposal must indicate where full details of compliance can be found (e.g., vendor's website or other exact location).

k.	Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12

To perform the work specified herein the contractor personnel may  require access to sensitive data, regular access to HHS-controlled facilities and/or access to HHS information systems, the Government may require that this effort entail a sensitivity level 5 (Public Trust) background investigation.*


•	Upon receipt of the Government’s notification of applicable Suitability Background Investigation required, the contractor shall complete and submit required forms within 30 days of the notification.  Additional submission instructions can be found at the NCI Information Technology Security Policies, Background Investigation Process: (http://ais.nci.nih.gov/).

•	The contractor shall submit a roster, by name, position and responsibility, of all IT staff working under the contract. The roster shall be submitted to the Project Officer, with a copy to the Contracting Officer, within 14 days of the effective date of the contract.  Any revisions to the Roster as a result of staffing changes shall be submitted within fifteen (15) calendar days of the change.  The Project Officer will submit the list to the HHS Personnel Security  Officer for determination of  the appropriate level of suitability investigations to be performed.               

Contractors should ensure that the employees whose names they submit have a reasonable chance for approval. While delays in performance caused by successful investigations will be the Government's responsibility, delays associated with rejections will be the contractor's responsibility.  

Typically, the Government conducts investigations and checks at no cost to the contractor. Multiple investigations for the same position, whether- resulting from rejections or resulting from an employee's move to another position(s) or company, may at the Contracting Officer's discretion, justify reductions(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the extra investigation.

* A level 5 is a Public Trust position, which requires a higher level background investigation, including personal interviews, credit checks, etc.  Level 5 positions would require access to IT systems with sensitive data including all of the OIT contractors, and/or access to pre-decisional grant information, etc.

Factors listed below will be rated based on a relative weighting as follows:  Significantly More Important - means that the factor is at least two times greater in value than another factor.  More Important - means that the factor is greater in value than another factor but less than two times greater.  Equal - means that the factor is of the same value or nearly the same as another factor.  For this solicitation, Factor 1 (Specialized Experience and Technical Competence) and Factor 2 (Key Personnel) are weighted equally and each factor individually is more important than Factor 3 (Past Performance) and Factor 4 (Work Management) and significantly more important than Factor 5 (Small Business Participation) and Factor 6 (Volume of DoD Contract Awards).  Past Performance and Work Management are weighted equally and each factor individually is more important than Small Business Participation and Volume of DoD Contract Awards.  Small Business Participation and Volume of DoD Contract Awards are weighted equally and will only be used as *tie-breakers* among firms that are essentially technically equal.  Information on each factor should be submitted FOR THE OFFICE AND/OR EMPLOYEE PERFORMING THE WORK IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  It is recognized that for firms with multiple offices, a project team may be formed from personnel from more than one office.  If more than one office is represented, this must be stated clearly in the work management plan and the Selection Board will consider the performance risk associated with that team not being co-located and the geographical proximity to the supported projects.
**** FACTOR 1 - SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE AND TECHNICAL COMPETENCE.  Specialized experience and technical competence (in descending order of importance within this category):  a. Design of projects on Special Operations Forces, Army, Navy or Air Force facilities.  b. Design of new facilities or utility systems of various types, sizes, and complexities.  c.

Use of automated design systems described above (MCACES, CADD, SpecsIntact, and DrChecks).  i. Construction phase services including shop drawing review and preparation of O&M manuals.  Technical competence will be judged based on a minimum of satisfactory performance and experience of the firm and its design team, longevity and previous working relationships among the working parties on similar projects, and most recent firm and employee history of experience on similar projects.  The evaluation of this factor will be based on the specialized experience and technical competence information from the previous five years.

<DESC>The Technology Applications Program Office (TAPO) is seeking a light weight replacement for the heavy steel Ballistic Protection System (BPS) currently used on its rotary wing aircraft.  As a result, TAPO has the requirement to conduct a second round of live fire tests on readily available aircraft armor panels (ballistic protection).  These systems should encompass the gamut of light weight ballistic protection to meet the objective and threshold requirements below.  Those firms who would like to participate in these live fire tests are invited to provide six 8” x 8” (eight-inch-square) panels at no cost to the government for the government’s use in the test.  Ballistic performance tests will be carried out using the following criteria: • Range/ Obliquity - 100 meters stand-off and zero obliquity (100m, 0 Deg); • Ballistic Protection - Threshold: 7.62mm x 39 API Type 56, Objective: 7.62mm x 63 AP M2.  An additional objective is repeatability, and firms may separately provide an additional 1’ x 1’ (one-foot-square) panel designed for multiple hits for evaluation using the following criteria: • Repeatability - 2 rounds within a 3” diameter.  The armor should be in its deployable state (i.e. have any and all coatings typically used when in normal operation in a combat environment) and at an Areal weight with a Mass Efficiency (ME) of 3 or greater, as compared to Rolled Homogeneous Armor (RHA).  TAPO is ultimately concerned with armor performance and weight, however armor deformation, maintainability/repairability, cost, fit, and ease of installation/removal will are relevant factors.  Mark your panels with appropriate markings to reflect supplier, type of material, armor fabrication, and intended design requirement for that panel (i.e. threshold or objective round).  Firms may provide additional armor designs to meet specific AOBPS requirements identified above.  Firms will only be provided the results from their own ballistic panel test event and will not have access to another firm’s result.  This is a Government only test event and participating firms cannot witness the test.  Additionally the Government requests the written composition of the armor panel to determine if any material or environmental concerns exist.  These details will be maintained by the Government and will not be shared with other firms.  The Government conducted live fire test shall occur in late September 2008.  Each firm’s panels must be delivered no later than 15 Sep 08.  Participating firms will be required to complete a written agreement that testing is at no cost or obligation to the Government.  Eligibility Information: The Government test results are technical data that are subject to export control.  In accordance with established policy and procedures for the dissemination and withholding of technical data that disclose export controlled technical data, participants need to be enterprises certified via DD Form 2345 to obtain export controlled technical data. Participation of foreign sources as subcontractors is subject to approval, authorization or licensing procedures. Contracting Officer for this action is Sharon Gayle, (757) 878-0730 ext 246.  TAPO Technical POC for this action is Sean Heatherman, Aerospace Engineer, (757) 878-3299 ext 266.
