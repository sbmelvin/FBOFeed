RFI TECHNICAL INFORMATION:  Advanced Track Illuminator Laser (ATILL)

A.	INTRODUCTION:
The Department of Defense (DoD) is interested in receiving proposals for a high average power diode-pumped solid-state laser (DPSSL) development program.  Based on research the Government has funded and/or reviewed, it is believed that the requirements of this BAA procurement can best be met with a cryogenically cooled, Ytterbium-doped YAG (Yb:YAG) laser that operates at ~1.03 microns.  However, the Government is also willing to consider other DPSSL approaches.  The program will consist of two phases: Phase 1 will cover a system performance trade assessment of the BAA technical requirements, preliminary laser system modeling and simulation, risk reduction experiments, a “compelling” sub-scale laboratory breadboard demonstration of the proposed laser technology/architecture approach at the contractor’s facility, and an Advanced Track Illuminator Laser (ATILL) brassboard preliminary design review (PDR); Phase 2 will cover laser system modeling and simulation, a laboratory breadboard demonstration at the contractor’s facility of the full ATILL output performance requirements, and an ATILL brassboard critical design review (CDR).  The Phase 1 system performance trade assessment will allow the contractor to perform a detailed evaluation of their proposed design, covering system performance and packaging parameters such as laser wavelength, average power, beam quality, pulse repetition frequency, pulse length, run-time and recycle time, start-up time, wallplug efficiency, output power to mass/volume ratios, operating/storage temperature ranges, operating/storage humidity ranges, and other operating/storage environmental specifications.  The primary purpose of the system performance trade assessment is to arrive at a design for airborne applications that optimally balances laser technical performance with system packaging, maintainability and reliability constraints.  As part of the trade assessment, the contractor will also generate an error budget tree for identifying and monitoring key technical performance and packaging issues during both phases of the technical effort.  The brassboard design effort in Phases 1 and 2 is for a ruggedized, flight-qualifiable laser brassboard (TRL 6) that meets all technical performance and packaging requirements listed herein.  Deliverables will be those called out in BAA AL-2006-01.  Delivery of a ruggedized brassboard laser is not part of this program solicitation.  The total program budget for the technical effort is approximately $16.5M for Phase 1 and $20M for Phase 2 (~$36.5M total funding).  Depending on funds availability and quality of the BAA technical proposals, one or two contractors may be funded for the first phase, which should be for approximately 30 months at ~$8M per effort.  Only one contractor may be funded for the second phase (~24 months).    The projected start date is near the end of the second quarter GFY06.  Open communication with the technical point of contact (POC), Stephen G. Post, MDA/AL, 505-853-3811, is encouraged until proposals are received.  Contracting questions should be directed to Capt. Dax Presuto, MDA/ALK, at 505-846-0758.  In addition, the DoD proposal evaluation team may contact an offeror to clarify a point of information before completing the proposal evaluation process.

B.	TECHNICAL TOPIC AREA:
Any contractor funded for both phases under this Advanced Track Illuminator Laser  development program will use modeling and simulation, analysis, design, risk reduction experiments, and laboratory breadboard testing to demonstrate a 5.5 kW-class, near diffraction limited, diode-pumped solid-state laser to the DoD.  During both phases, all modeling and simulation shall be validated by risk reduction experiments and testing of the laboratory breadboard (subscale during Phase 1, and full-scale during Phase 2).  Emphasis will be placed on solid-state laser architectures that are favorable in terms of size, weight, efficiency, affordability, reliability, maintainability, supportability, environmental acceptability (for airborne platforms), and ruggedness.  The contractor(s) is(are) expected to address these issues both in the proposal and throughout program execution.

The DoD is specifically interested in approaches that address the following diode-pumped solid-state laser output performance goals (in descending order of importance):
1)	Wavelength: The laser wavelength shall be at ~1.03 microns.
2)	Radiance (W/cm^2-sr): The Radiance (Brightness) of the laser output beam shall be greater than or equal to a laser of 5.5 kW average power with a Beam Quality (BQ) better than or equal to 1.5 times the diffraction limit (xDL) as directly measured by a far-field power-in-the-bucket (PITB) technique, where the bucket extent is nominally defined by the energy/power contained in the laser’s far-field central lobe.  The laser shall have a minimum average output power of 5.0 kW over the entire run-time duration specified in paragraph (a) below.
3)	Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF): The laser’s PRF shall nominally be 5.0 kHz, variable plus or minus 15 percent with a controlled PRF slew rate of up to 1500 Hertz per second.
4)	Pulse Length: The laser’s full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) temporal pulse length shall be less than or equal to 15 ns, with a goal of less than or equal to 5 ns.  As part of the laser system trade study during the first contract phase, the effect of pulse length on laser system performance and reliability will be investigated.
5)	Coherence Length: The laser output temporal coherence length shall be less than or equal to 5 centimeters (goal of 2 centimeters).
6)	Polarization: The laser output polarization shall be linear with a contrast ratio of greater than 100 to 1.
7)	Beam Jitter: The total beam jitter shall be no greater than 10% of the far-field instantaneous beam diameter as measured at the FWHM power points.  The contractor should assume that the laser will be mounted on an isolated table—the table will not induce jitter in the laser head.
8)	Pulse-to-Pulse Energy Stability: The pulse-to-pulse energy variation shall not exceed plus/minus 2 percent.

Additionally, the DoD is interested in approaches that address the following design-to diode-pumped solid-state laser brassboard goals (in descending order of importance):
a)	Run Time: The laser brassboard shall be designed to operate continuously for at least 300 s (goal of 600 s).  All performance measurements on the Phase 1 sub-scale and Phase 2 full-scale laboratory devices (power, beam quality, efficiency, beam jitter, etc.) shall be recorded over a time period of at least 300 s.  Additionally, the device shall be capable of reasonable on/off cycling (e.g., ten or more twenty-second bursts with five-second periods of non-lasing between bursts, then return to stand-by).  In this mode of operation, the requisite run time only includes the sum of the “laser on” periods.  The laser power supply and cooling system recycle times are mission and platform dependent; recycle time impact on system weight, volume, efficiency, etc. will be evaluated as part of the Phase 1 system performance trade assessments.
b)	Start-Up Time: The laser start-up time, defined as the time required to transition from a stand-by condition (defined during the Phase 1 system performance trade study) to a condition where all output requirements are met, shall be no more than 1 s.
c)	Wallplug Efficiency: The laser wallplug efficiency shall be greater than or equal to 12%, where wallplug efficiency is defined as the average optical output power of the laser divided by the sum of all electrical average power delivered to all power supplies, drivers, cooling systems, pumps, and control devices used to operate the laser.  The contractor is required to design a 5.5 kW-class laser brassboard meeting this specification for airborne applications.
d)	Output Power-To-Mass Ratio: During the system trade study, risk reduction and laboratory demonstration efforts, the contractor must clearly show through appropriate systems engineering methodology and calculations that their laser brassboard design will meet an output power-to-mass ratio requirement of 12 W/kg (goal of 15 W/kg) for a nominal 5.5 kW average power laser system, which equates to a total system mass of less than 459 kg (goal of 367 kg).  The laser is nominally defined as the laser head plus the system heat exchangers (no externally available thermal reservoir should be assumed), power supplies, controller, wiring, tubing, etc.  The laser head typically includes gain media and associated fixed attachments (diodes, heat exchanger manifolds, mechanical structures, etc), optics, mounts, along with an optical mounting assembly, cover, and other necessary fixtures.  The contractor is required to design a 5.5 kW-class laser brassboard meeting this specification for airborne applications.
e)	Output Power-To-Volume Ratio: During the system trade study, risk reduction and laboratory demonstration phases, the contractor must clearly show through appropriate systems engineering methodology and calculations that their deliverable brassboard laser will meet an output power-to-volume ratio of 0.01 W/cm^3 (goal of 0.02 W/cm^3) for a nominal 5.5 kW average power laser system, which equates to a total volume of less than or equal to 0.55 cubic meters (goal of less than or equal to 0.28 cubic meters).  See item (d) for a definition of what constitutes the laser system.  The contractor is required to design a 5.5 kW-class laser brassboard meeting this specification for airborne applications.
f)	Temperature Range: The ambient operating temperature range of the laser brassboard design for ground-based and airborne applications shall be 15 to 35 degrees C, and its storage temperature range shall be –50 to 50 degrees C.  Herein, “storage” is defined as the periods between tests or missions (e.g., an aircraft in an unheated aircraft hanger).
g)	Humidity: For ground-based operations, up to 95% humidity from 2 to 35 degrees C; for airborne applications, up to 85% humidity from 15 to 35 degrees C.
h)	Operating/Storage Pressure: –1,000 ft to 10,000 ft.
i)	Platform operating angles, acceleration, vibration, shock, and other operating/storage parameters will be provided early in Phase 1 during the system performance trade assessment effort.  As a minimum, offerors should provide a laser system design that is compatible with an airborne environment similar to a 747-type aircraft.

For item (2), the contractor shall discuss in their proposal how they intend to measure the laser’s Radiance (Brightness), output power and beam quality and what the possible technical issues are in making such measurements.  Additionally, the contractor shall provide in their proposal a discussion of beam quality based on PITB (not M-squared).  The contractor must also define and discuss how measurements will be made for items (3) through (8) and (a) through (i).  Again, it is noted here that, though a laser system brassboard design shall be developed through PDR level during Phase 1 and CDR level during Phase2, there is no laser system brassboard deliverable for the future BAA.

As noted previously, the program shall be carried out in two phases.  Each phase shall be priced separately, with Phase 1 offered as the basic contract and Phase 2 offered as a contract option.  It is also noted here that hardware procured and used in Phase 1 may be also used in the Phase 2 contract option (if exercised).

As part of the brassboard laser system design effort, the contractor will ensure through appropriate evaluation/assessment techniques that the laser beam’s output characteristics do not somehow preclude ready insertion into an agreed upon beam delivery system at a Government facility or on a specified platform.  This effort will be included in the Phase 1 system performance trade assessment, which as mentioned previously will also cover laser wavelength, average power, beam quality, pulse repetition frequency, pulse length, run-time and recycle time, start-up time, wallplug efficiency, output power to mass/volume ratios, operating/storage temperature ranges, operating/storage humidity ranges, and other operating/storage environmental specifications.

For the intended BAA solicitation, flight qualifiable means that the laser brassboard is designed to undergo flight qualification testing with minimal system hardware/software changes required.  This approximately corresponds to a Technology Readiness Level 6.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the sam relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: “See Note 22”

<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement for drop-tower testing scaled models of  the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) propellant tank, to determine the tank configuration that will meet the launch vehicle vendor's nutation time constant requirements. NASA/GSFC intends to issue a sole-source Request for Proposal (RFP) to Applied Dynamics Laboratories.  The Applied Dynamics Laboratories shall perform drop-tower testing for the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) propellant tank, to determine the tank configuration that will meet the launch vehicle vendor’s nutation time constant requirements.  This testing is essential in order to ensure the tank configuration will meet the launch vehicle vendor's nutation time constant requirements in order to launch the first mission towards the new NASA initiative of exploring the Moon, Mars, and beyond.  Applied Dynamics Laboratories is uniquely qualified for this requirement because of their ability to perform the type of drop tower testing needed.  NASA has determined that Applied Dynamics Laboratories is the only vendor which can provide this type of testing and is the only research group that has the experience of developing scaled models to match a number of dimensionless parameters needed to assure proper scaling between the model and the flight hardware.  Based on the knowledge of the current market, Applied Dynamics Laboratories is the only available source that can deliver with the current urgency.  NASA/GSFC proposes to enter into a firm fixed price (FFP) contract with Applied Dynamics Laboratories. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See Notes 22, 26, and B. Statutory authority for this sole source procurement is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1)--Only One Responsible Source.  However, organizations who believe they can provide these services without any detrimental impact to the program schedules supported by this work, should fully identify their interest and capabilities within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Interested organizations have 15 days from the publication of this synopsis to submit in writing to the identified point of contact, their qualifications/capabilities. Such qualifications/capabilities will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. Responses received after the 15 days or without the required information will be considered non-responsive to the synopsis and will not be considered. A determination by the Government to not compete this proposed effort on a full and open competitive basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  All qualified responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the agency.  Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for noncommercial item prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number N00167-05-Q-5207 applies and is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). The requirement is set-aside for small business concerns 100%. Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division (NSWCCD) intends to negotiate an award with VXI Technology, Irvine, California 92614, on a sole source basis for a VXI Digital Signal Processing System. The Model Instrumentation System (MIS) used on the Intermediate Scale Measurement System (ISMS) underwater test range must be expanded to support planned acoustical tests. MIS was initially developed in 1999 using Hewlett Packard’s (HP) E 1432 digitizing and source modules. Since that time HP has sold this line of equipment to VXI Technology  where the product continues to be supported and upgraded. VXI Technology now calls the module a VT1432B.  In the development of MIS, the Navy invested approximately 2.5 work-years of software development in programming the VT1432B modules with a value of $362K and therefore an award other than to VXI Technology would result in a substantial duplication in costs to the Government.

RYG is authorized by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Acquisition) for use in the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain, and operate the Fleet. (b) The Government reserves the right to award to the supplier whose quote represents the best value to the Government.  As such, the basis for award will include an evaluation of each supplier’s past performance history for the Federal Supply Class(s) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) of the supplies and services being purchased.  The price to be considered in determining best value will be the evaluated price after application of Technical Evaluation Adjustments (TEAs). (c) The procedures described in the clause entitled "Additional Evaluation Factor for Consideration of Past Performance--Navy Red/Yellow/Green Program (APR 1999)" will be used to a!  ssist in determining the best value for the Government. CAR-M01  ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTOR FOR CONSIDERATION OF PAST PERFORMANCE—NAVY RED/YELLOW/GREEN PROGRAM (APR 1999) (a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) Program, authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain, and operate the Fleet. (b) The purpose of RYG is to assist contracting personnel during source selection to determine the best value for the Government.  The program uses accumulated supplier past performance data to classify each supplier’s performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) as either red (high risk), yellow (moderate risk), green (low risk), or neutral (no risk established).  (c) To assist in source selection, a monetary assessment in the form of a Technical Evaluation Adjustment (TEA) is added to each supplier’s quote having a red or yellow classification!   for the FSC involved.  The dollar amount of the red or yellow TEA assessment is based on the cost to the Government of effecting additional actions required to assure performance by a supplier with an unsatisfactory performance history for the FSC(s) involved.  No TEA is assessed for a supplier having either a green or a neutral FSC RYG classification.  For purposes of the RYG program, a neutral classification is assigned to suppliers who are first time quoters to the Government for the FSC(s) involved, suppliers otherwise having no past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved, and suppliers whose past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved are over three years old.  After consideration of any other pertinent, price-related factors (e.g., transportation charges, first article testing, discount terms), the adjusted price becomes the basis for determining award.  A supplier’s FSC RYG classification may change over time as new or rev!  ised performance data becomes available.  (d) RYG Classifications are  summarized as follows:  (1) Green is low risk.  No performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  No TEA will be assessed. (2) Yellow is moderate risk.  Additional performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier’s price to reflect the Government’s estimated additional costs. (3) Red is high risk.  Significant additional performance assurance requirements are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier’s price to reflect the Government’s estimated additional costs.  (4) Neutral is no risk established.  No TEA is assessed; nevertheless, additional performance assurance requirements may be considered necessary to assure quality and on-time delivery.  (e) RYG classifications for all applicable FSCs are established monthly for each supplier and provided to them.  Suppliers may address questions about the program or their FSC RYG classifications to the Naval Sea Logistics Center (NLSC) Portsmouth Detachment!  , Federal Building, Room 400, 80 Daniel Street, Portsmouth, NH  0380l-3884, telephone 603-431-9460, ext. 464.  FAX 603-431-9464.  Suppliers may also access their individual FSC RYG classifications through the automated vendor access program.  To obtain automated access, written request must be submitted on company letterhead to NLSC at the above address.  The request must include the requester’s name, title, company name, address, telephone number and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code.  The CAGE code is mandatory.  In response, NLSC will provide each supplier, without charge, with an individual password, all required software, and information on accessing its individual data. To be eligible for award you must be properly registered in the Government's Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Offerors may obtain information on CCR registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at www.ccr.gov.

RYG is authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for the acquisition of commodities used to build and maintain the Fleet--materials, parts and components of ships, planes and weapons systems. (B) The Government reserves the right to award to the contractor whose offer represents the best overall purchase value to the Government. As such, the basis for contract award will include an evaluation of !  proposed contractor's quality performance history. The price to be considered in determining the best value will be the evaluated price after Technical Evaluation Adjustments (TEA) or related quality assurance actions, as applicable, are applied to the offered price. (C) The procedures described in the clause of this solicitation entitled "ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTORS--CONTRACTOR EVALUATION SYSTEM, RED/YELLOW/GREEN PROGRAM (MAY 1992)" will be used by the Contracting Officer to assist in determining the best purchase value for the Government - price, past quality performance and other factors considered.

<DESC>Description
The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to provide Business Transformation and Information Technology support services and products for Retirement Systems Modernization’s (RSM’s) existing and future foundation elements and useful segments.  The proposed acquisition will be solicited using Full and Open Competition procedures. We will consider all responsible sources that submit a responsive technical and price proposal by the closing time and date of the RFP.  OPM anticipates awarding a indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) single award contract that allows for firm fixed price delivery orders. 

The resulting performance-based contract will enable OPM to successfully integrate our defined benefits technology with existing OPM and other federal agency legacy systems; and transform our business operations to efficiently and effectively make use of our modernized systems and digital beneficiary files.  By procuring business transformation and information technology services, OPM will improve their support to the beneficiary population by ensuring that retirement benefits are disbursed timely and accurately.  

We encourage offerors to submit proposals either as a single entity or as part of a team/consortium. The successful offeror will provide business transformation and information technology services to support our administration of the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) and the Federal Employees Retirement Systems (FERS). The total set of capabilities to be provided will be determined based upon your submissions and we will weigh the costs, benefits, and risks of your submissions.

Your submissions must include the following services, which may be purchased at our discretion:

1.	Business Transformation, and

OPM intends to procure the required services under terms and conditions similar to those used in the private sector.

The Contractor may be required to travel to Boyers, Pennsylvania and other locations in the Continental U.S.

Duration of the contract period: The period of performance includes a 12 month base period plus four 12-month option periods.

You are strongly encouraged to attend this conference. Attending the conference will familiarize you with our operations, infrastructure and business processes, and should help you prepare a more responsive proposal. At least two days prior to the conference, you must email to the OPM point of contact a notice of your intent to attend.  Each bidder will be limited to two attendees.  Due to security concerns, offerors failing to register will not be allowed to attend.  When registering for the conference, all offerors must provide the following information:

1.	Your Company Name
2.	Single Company Point of Contact (first name, last name, title, telephone, fax, email, and mailing address)

<DESC>This is a Notice of Contract Action. The Air Force Flight Test Center, Edwards AFB CA. (AFFTC) intends to modify an existing contract for telemetry support packages.  The modification would result in additional purchases of KGR 68-B Decryption Units.  The award will result in a modification to a sole-source, 5-year, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract to L-3 Communications, Telemetry East Division, 1515 Grundy’s Lane, Bristol, PA 19007, for the following: 135 (estimated) KGR 68-B units.  The modification will also allow for additional Upgrade/Enhancements and Maintenance/Repair to the decryption devices.  The model KGR 68-B is a complete Telemetry Data Decryption unit designed primarily for aircraft flight test use.

This unit supports bit rates of 10K-Bits/Sec to 50 Mega-Bit/Sec.  It is cryptographically compatible with the KGV-68 based systems.  It is compatible with existing KUTA or THORNTON class equipment and will accept the Crypto Key Fill from COMSEC fill devices such as the KOI-18 and KYK-13.  The unit operates across the Plain Text domains and is characterized for TEMPEST requirements.  It provides the necessary support power for the PCM Encoder Data Source, as well as the associated Telemetry Transmitter.  The KGR 68-B contains an encryptor plug-in module that allows for removal and/or replacement of the encryptor assembly.  Other functions include provisions for erasing the Crypto Key, automatic disabling of the Telemetry Transmitter Power during the Crypto Key fill operation, and filtering of the encrypted output signal suitable for transmission. 
The NAICs code is 334220 and the size is 750 employees.  Contractors must be certified by the National Security Agency.  Qualified contractors must submit clear and convincing documentation that fully defines their capability to meet the requirement.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The response date is extended to 9/26/05.  The following are questions and answers generated by interested parties:
1.	The overall RFQ is a bit vague. Can we get a brief overview of what the office automation system is? It mentions a lot of different capabilities; can you better describe how the application will be used?  Answer:  We have workflows in Visio but we are particularly looking for a COTS product that is pre-configured to the work of an Institutional Review Board.  We are aware of 7-8 of these already in the marketplace. 
2.	The FedBizOpps notice says the automation system should support electronic submissions. What type of submissions are these and what are they comprised of and in what format would they be in?  Answer:  Word, RTF, PDF, XML
3.	From bullet two, please define workflow configuration.  Answer:  Refers to the capability of business super-users doing the workflow configuration rather than programmers. 
4.	From bullet four, which application does the end user want templates to be in? What database would these templates be merged into? Will that database be part of this application?  Answer:  We are anticipating a SQL database such as SQLServer.  SQLServer is preferred since NIH has a site license and that represents lesser cost to government.   
5.	In bullet 6, please explain what auditing capabilities the end user wants.  Answer:  Regulatory requirements including who did what, when and why to submissions.  21 CFR Part 11 requires that audit trails be difficult or impossible for administrators to alter.  
6.	Bullet 10 mentions improving the accessibility of research submission data. Do you currently have an application that you are using now to perform these functions? How is research submission data accessed now and what sort of improvements are you looking for?  Answer:  We have a custom application developed 7 years ago but which no longer serves our requirements and uses older programming languages which are no longer well supported.    
7.	From bullet 13, for providing automated alerts, what kind of tickler alert or notification are you referring to? Would an e-mail alert suffice? Answer:  For the most part email alerts will work.  The app must be able to leverage our Exchange service for addresses and other metadata.
8.	Should the RFQ response be in a particular format? If so, could you please forward further format instructions?  Answer:  All information is called out in the synopsis. 
9.	Do you need the resumes for personnel that would work on this project?  Answer:  Key Personnel 
10.	 Does the work need to be performed on-site?  Answer: absolutely
11.	Is there a detailed requirements document available for vendors to look at? Answer:  Yes
12.	What exactly is expected by the due date (September 23, 2005)? Is there a certain format that the response must follow? Answer:  We are looking for a COTS product that is fully developed for use by Institutional Review Boards.  We are aware of 7 to 8 of these in the marketplace.  We expect a response that shows how the vendor’s product is a configured, near-ready product for this very specified niche. 
13.	Our company was certified 8(a) Small Disadvantaged Business by SBA as of September 9, 2005 but the CCR database hasn’t been updated to reflect this new status for the company. Will this prevent us from being qualified to bid for this contract?  Answer:  No, but be aware that this is not an 8(a) set-aside. 
14.	What is expected in the offer, a COTS product or a custom solution proposal? The language in the pre-solicitation notice is a little confusing. It says “The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) has a requirement for an Office automation system to include two additional installments with the software”, which implies that NIAID is looking for two additional installments of a particular software package, while the rest of the notice implies that it is a custom software development effort to deliver required functionalities. Would you please clarify exactly what is needed?  Answer:  This remark is an artifact of our COTS thinking.  We assume there will be a license acquisition phase, an installation phase and a configuration and deployment phase.  Yes.  We are absolutely looking for as mature a COTS product as we can find. 
15.	Would a North Carolina (CCR registered) company be allowed to take part in this? If so, can we develop most of the application at our site?  (It will minimize travel expenses).   Answer: Any company located elsewhere can participate. We are looking for a COTS product, not development.  If a COTS product does not emerge that fits our needs, we would consider off-site development.
16.	Right now, you have a business process for the submissions and approval which is semi-automatic with paper handling and human intervention?  Answer:  Yes  
17.	Do you want to automate this process as much as possible with a very good audit trail and in a more efficient way? Answer:  We have already engaged in a gap analysis, workflows, requirements process and have a very defined idea of how we’ll improve our process. 
18.	You have Microsoft technology already in your office.  Is it acceptable to develop a Microsoft solution using .Net framework and MS SQL server as the database?  Is this acceptable? Answer:  We are looking for a COTS product that has been developed specifically for the work of an Institutional Review Board.  We want to avoid development and comply with Clinger-Cohen Act. 
19.	Will this be a web based system running on the Intranet?  Answer:  This is our vision.  It would also have to be platform independent as we have many Macintosh computers in our group.
20.	The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has a requirement for an Office automation system to include two additional installments with the software. Do you have the software to install OR is this a development effort? Answer:  We are looking for responses from vendors with mature COTS applications. 
21.	As can be seen from your website, you have multiple offices and multiple users.  Can you give me a rough idea on number of users, number of submissions per year, number of approvals per year?  Answer:  Approx. 200 users and 700 submissions per year. 
22.	Is the intent of this RFQ to procure via "simplified acquisition" procedures, so total value of contract will not exceed $100k, correct? Answer:  The RFQ is prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as a commercial item. 
23.	Is the RFQ contract expected to be awarded in FY2005 (before the end of the fiscal year) or FY2006?  Answer:  Award in ’05 
24.	Are you allowed to provide a Rough Order of Magnitude amount for what is available (e.g., $50,000, $100,000, $300,000, 1 million)? Answer:  No
25.	We have developed web-based questionnaire, reporting, and workflow technologies under Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) contracts from the NIH and Air Force.  These technologies are prototypes that could be adapted to meet most of the needs of the NIH, but that would take a year of development, customization, and testing.  Our technologies are not commercial off the shelf (COTS) products.  For example, requirement #3 asks for "Include Microsoft Office and Acrobat PDF integration out-of-the-box.  Answer:  This requirement is being conducted using FAR Subpart 12.6 for Commercial Items. We are looking for a COTS product that is fully developed for use by Institutional Review Boards.  We’re aware of a number of products in the marketplace. 
26.	Is the technology expected to encode the specific forms, data, and workflow processes required by NIAID or provide NIAID with capabilities for it to encode this knowledge? Answer:  Yes 
27.	Will NIH staff be available to refine requirements (e.g., either templates to the different types of forms or the forms themselves depending on the answer to the previous question)?  Answer:  Yes.
28.	Will NIH staff be available for beta testing?  Answer:  Yes.  
29.	Our company has an out-of-the-box solution that meets these requirements.   Is this acceptable?  Answer:  It appears your company has a configurable portal.  We are looking first for a COTS product that has been thoroughly configured to the work of an Institutional Review Board.  We’re aware of a number of products in the marketplace.  Only if we could not find a product compliant with Clinger-Cohen directive and which supports a large proportion of our business process out-of-the-box would we consider a configurable portal. 
30.	How much experience would be needed to perform this task? Answer:  A thorough understanding of Institutional Review Boards and their business and regulatory environments is needed. 
31.	Are any clearances needed?  Answer:  PSL-5.  
32.	Are there any subcontracting opportunities available?  Answer:  That is for each vendor to determine. 
33.	Can more information be provided in general?  Answer:  We are looking at responses from vendors with fully configured COTS application intended for use by Institutional Review Boards.  We do not wish to develop other than as a last resort.  We are aware of 7-8 COTS products in the marketplace that are intended for IRB use.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification to the Request for Information for Force Readiness Support Services is to respond to several questions that have been raised. The date for submission of responses is unchanged as a result of this modification.

Question 1: Is there an incumbent contractor currently providing these services?

Response: Yes, these services are currently being provided by Aaron B. Floyd Enterprises, Inc. under Contract HC1047-04-C-4056.

Question 2: A question has arisen regarding the preferred technology for this environment. Please provide detailed information about the current state (hosting platforms, networking infrastructure, development environment and tool set such as .net, rational, or other, and databases). Also, please provide a brief description of the organization's vision for moving forward and interests related to technology.

Response: The Global Command and Control System - Joint (GCCS-J) Force Readiness is the official Department of Defense registry for all military units worldwide. It is the Department of Defense's "system of record" for providing the mandatory readiness status of all military units worldwide with respect to the quality and quantity of personnel and equipment. Unit status is continually updated, but by law must be updated at least once every 30 days. The Force Readiness system consists of the following three applications: Readiness Assessment System Input Tool, Status of Resources and Training System Database, and Readiness System Output Tool. The system must meet all J6 security requirements. J6 is the accreditation authority. Currently, GCCS-J Force Readiness is moving to a new block upgrade. This block upgrade, call Block V, focuses on establishing web-based functionality housed on an Oracle 10g/Solaris 10 architecture.

Respondents are reminded that the date for submission of responses is unchanged as a result of this modification.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification to a previous notice is to address additional questions that have been submitted. The date for submission of responses is unchanged as a result of this information. Information regarding the network architecture topology is available as two Power Point documents separately uploaded to FedBizOpps.

Question: In order to better understand and respond, could you please provide further detail into the following: network architecture topology; elaboration on the development environment (number of users, platforms, software and versions, etc.); and existing databases within the architecture to include: quantity within the network, vendor and database version for each location, primary application/functionality (financial, logistics, etc.), current and anticipated growth in size database size for each location, and current anticipated growth in users/queries for each location number of users for each location. Would the Government consider products other than Oracle 10g and Solaris that met and/or exceeded these requirements?

Response:

1) Additional Overview comments: The Status of Resources and Training System (SORTS) is the central registry for all Operational Units in the Department of Defense. It is the single automated reporting system within DoD that provides the senior leadership with authoritative identification, location, assignment, personnel, and equipment data. It contains the condition and level of resources and training and the Commander's assessment of how the status of his/her resources and training levels affect the Unit's readiness status. Units report by exception with 24 hours of a change and submit validation reports if no changes occur within 30 days.

2) Network architecture topology: See two Power Point documents separately uploaded to FedBizOpps.

3) Elaboration on development environment: Force Readiness is split into three categories, as follows: the Readiness Assessment System Input Tool, the SORTS database, and the Readiness Assessment System Output Tool. Development activities are conducted at the current vendor's facility and the DISA Skyline laboratory, with testing occurring at the DISA Skyline laboratory and the Engineering/Integration suite at Northrop-Grumman. Currently, the Force Readiness architecture resides on Sun Fire V440 servers, hoping to move to Sun Fire V890 Servers. In February, SORTS released Version 4.0.2 and will be releasing Version 4.0.3 in October.

4) Quantity of databases within the network: The architecture contains two primary databases, the SORTS master database (containing current readiness data) and the Historical database (containing historical readiness data). The subcomponents of these databases are shown in the two Power Point documents separately uploaded to FedBizOpps.

5) Vendor and database version: The incumbent contractor has been previously identified in Modification 01. The Readiness Assessment System Input Tool and the SORTS database are on Version 4.0.3 and the Readiness Assessment Output Tool is on Version Global 4.0.1.

6) Primary application/functionality: described in overview statement above (statement 1).

7) Database location: The database serves the readiness reporting needs of Joint Staff, all Military Services (including Coast Guard), and all Combatant Commands. In performing this support, the SORTS master database is distributed by means of local GORAs (Global SORTS Oracle Client Database) to 39 locations worldwide. The User pool should remain relatively constant as we move into Block V.

8) Architecture Issues: Force Readiness is a "system within a system." It belongs to a family of command and control mission applications (to include COP, I3, SORTS, JOPES, etc.) based upon a Common Operational Environment established by the GCCS-J Systems Engineer. In order to stay consistent throughout the architecture, it is necessary for all mission applications to remain on the same architectural base - for

<DESC>Potential respondents to the Request for Information for Force Readiness Support Services are advised that the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of 541519 assigned to the notice was not all inclusive of the types of NAICS codes that might be appropriate for the requirement. NAICS code 541519 most closely described the acquisition. Other NAICS codes that might apply include: 541330, 541511, 541512 and 541513.

Respondents are reminded that the original Request for Information paragraph entitled ADMINISTRATIVE INFORMATION required responses to include: Your company's business size, including applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code(s), and type of business (e.g., small, small disadvantaged, woman-owned, HUBZone, service-disabled veteran-owned, historically black college and university/minority institution, Native American, large, etc.). Block V this will be Oracle 10g and Solaris 10. At this time, Force Readiness will not be allowed to move off of this baseline.

Respondents are reminded the date for submission of responses is unchanged as a result of this modification.

<DESC>The purpose of the modification to a previous notice is to provide interested parties with additional information regarding the subject procurement. An interested offeror posed a number of questions regarding this requirement and was provided with the following information.

Question: Will the current NAICS code for this requirement continue to be used?
Response: The current NAICS code is 541519 with a size standard of $21 million. The current NAICS code assigned to this requirement is under review.
Question: How will the recent acquisition of the incumbent contractor, Aaron B. Floyd Enterprises, Inc., by Indus Corporation impact this competition?
Response: At this time, a meeting with the Small and Disadvantaged Utilization Specialist is being requested. The recent acquisition of the incumbent contractor may pose some concerns regarding the NAICS code and the business status.
Question: Is the intention of the agency to allow the incumbent contractor to compete for the follow-on effort?
Response: Yes.
Question: Will a draft Request for Proposal be released to industry for review and comment?
Response: At this time, there is no plan to issue a draft Request for Proposal to industry for this requirement.
Question: When will a Request for Proposal be released?
Response: The requirement is still in the acquisition planning phase. The responses to the Request for Information notice are currently under review. At present, there is no formal package in place permitting a Request for Proposal to be released. The earliest possible time frame in which a Request for Proposal might be released is November, 2005. However, a more realistic time frame for release of a Request for Proposal is probably January, 2006.
Question: When does the current contract expire?
Response: The current contract expires on 11 May 2006.
Question: What is the value of the current contract?
Response: The value of the current contract that includes a base and one option is $9,715,374.00 including award fee.
Question: Will the value of the follow-on contract be similar to the value of the current contract?
Response: It is unknown at this time whether the value of the follow-on contract will be at or near the $9,715,374.00 value of the existing contract.
Question: Has the Defense Information Systems Agency considered awarding the follow-on contract using one of its existing contract vehicles such as NexGen or Encore?
Response: No. To use one of the existing vehicles would limit the competition to those vendors included under NexGen or Encore and would exclude the incumbent contractor from competing on this follow-on requirement.
Question: Would the Defense Information Systems Agency consider using full and open competition for the follow on contract?
Response: Yes, the possibility of a full and open competition exists. Responses to the Request for Information notice indicated interest from both small and large businesses. Additionally, many small businesses expressed an interest in possible subcontracting opportunities for the follow on requirement. This issue is going to be a topic of discussion with the agency's Small and Disadvantaged Utilization Specialist.
Question: What is the current contract type on the existing contract and will that contract type be used on the competed requirement?
Response: The current contract type is cost-plus-award-fee. It has not been determined at this time whether the follow-on procurement would continue to be a cost-plus-award-fee type contract.

Interested offerors are invited to submit written questions regarding this requirement to marina.atchison@disa.mil. Offerors are advised that responses to questions will be published so information is shared equally with all potential offerors.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification to the Request for Information for Force Readiness Support Services is to respond to a question that has been raised. The date for submission of responses is unchanged as a result of this modification.

Question 1: Can we obtain more information on the block upgrade to Oracle 10g and Solaris 10?

Response: The Force Readiness mission application is a "system within a system" (or is a member of a "family of systems") that provide the Department of Defense (DoD) with its command and control capability. This overarching command and control capability is call Global Command and Control System - Joint (GCCS-J). Force Readiness is but one of many mission applications that reside under the GCCS-J "umbrella." The GCCS-J establishes the common operating environment upon which all mission applications must reside. As stated previously, Force Readiness is the authoritative system-of-record database for tracking the status (quality and quantity) of all equipment and personnel assigned to a formal UIC. In Block V, the GCCS-J Common Operating Environment will include Solaris 10 and Oracle 10g. The Force Readiness mission application (consisting of the input tool, output tool, and database) must be able to reside upon this foundational common operating environment.

<RESPDATE>123005
<CONTACT>Technical Points of Contact: Mr. Michael H. Jones 812-854-6230 Mr. Fred E. Justis 812-854-1292
<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.eps.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the Internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the NSWC Division Crane. PURPOSE: This is a preliminary sources-sought announcement seeking comment from free-world industry, academia, and government.  This announcement is issued as part of a market research effort to support a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) assessment of the state of the art of Clip-On Night Vision Device – Sensor Fusion (CNVD-SF).  This TRL assessment will be used by US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) to determine if and when a CNVD-SF acquisition project will be undertaken, and may also be used provide parameters for initial performance specifications.      BACKGROUND:   When night approaches in combat, most night vision sights for rifles and carbines require that the basic day riflescope be removed and replaced with a night vision scope.  The process is reversed each morning as the sun rises.  This design methodology has been in place since the earliest passive night vision scopes of the 1960’s.   a.  While passive night aiming capability is critical in modern warfare, this changeover method is plagued by a number of problems: (1) Despite the best mounting and dismounting hardware and procedures, there is never any real assurance that either the day or night scope have returned to “zero” after the exchange procedure, especially in sandy or muddy operational conditions.  This causes lack of confidence and occasional missed enemy targets both day and night. (2) The combatant must carry two full sighting subsystems, increasing the rucksack load. (3) The day and night scopes normally have different fields of view, different aiming reticles, and other operational and technical differences, doubling the operator’s burden of training, zeroing, and fine motor skill performance in combat. (4) The combatant must change rifle/carbine sights at dawn and dusk, two very dangerous tactical times of the day. To alleviate the above problems, the contemporary SOF combatant sometimes opts to carry his carbine or machinegun equipped with the night sight 24/7, increasing the load on his arms, decreasing his daytime capability and decreasing the effective life of the expensive night sight.   b.  Clip-on Night Sighting:  In the 1980’s, the concept of the Clip-on Night Vision Device (CNVD) emerged, a different design than the traditional method.  Instead of replacing the daylight riflescope, the new concept was to clip on a night vision device to the basic riflescope.  The CNVD is clipped on only when needed, without disturbing the basic daylight riflescope or its mounting.  The CNVD concept eliminates nearly all of the problems found in the earlier method, however, the technology was much less mature and far more expensive.  This CNVD capability was fielded on sniper rifles beginning the late 1980’s on a very limited basis due to the high cost and technical complexities of early CNVD’s. c.  Program and Background:  The USSOCOM Special Operations Peculiar Modification (SOPMOD) program provides small arms accessories to Army, Navy, and Air Force Special Forces Operators.  In 1993, USSOCOM arranged with the Naval Sea Systems Command to establish the SOPMOD Program Management Office at the Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC), Crane Division, at Crane, Indiana.  Since then, the SOPMOD Program has provided joint Special Operations Forces (SOF) with standardized, versatile weapons accessories to meet all needs across SOF mission scenarios.  These accessories increase SOF survivability and lethality by providing enhanced weapon performance, target acquisition, and day and night precision aiming.  The SOPMOD program provides these accessories to SOF operators when the accessories are developed to the point that they are operationally suitable, affordable, sustainable, and funded.  SOPMOD is an evolutionary acquisition program that continues to change and to upgrade !  its subsystems with new combat technologies.   d.  Requirements and Prior Contract Activity:  In October of 1999, USSOCOM validated the requirement for a SOPMOD CNVD scaled to perform on carbines.  In July of 2000, the SOPMOD program issued SOL N00164-00-R-0135, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, which sought to initiate a variety of new capabilities for SOF weapons and accessories research and development, to include an advanced CNVD called “Sensor Fusion Module.”  Later, on 24 May 2002, NSWC Crane, Code 805, issued SOL N00164-02-R-8512.  This resulted in the fielding of the Universal Night Sight (UNS, AN/PVS-22) to SOF Snipers.  The AN/PVS-22 is based on Image Intensification (I2) technology.  In February of 2002, the SOPMOD Program issued a subsequent solicitation, SOL N0016402R0014, MINI DAY/NIGHT SIGHT (MDNS) DEVELOPMENT, which contained a requirement for a miniaturized CNVD to be scaled in cost and size for proliferation on carbines and machineguns.   This effort is resulting in two types of miniature CNVD, one based on ima!  ge intensification (CNVD-I2, currently designated Night Vision Device AN/PVS-24) and the other based on thermal imaging (CNVD-T, currently designated Thermal Sight SU-232/PAS).  However, no vendor that participated was able to demonstrate a working prototype system that contained both types of sensing, or other multi-spectral capabilities.  Since that time, various industrial, government, and academic research efforts have continued to seek a tactical sensor-fusion aiming capability for small arms.  e.  System Acquisition Planning:  The SOPMOD Acquisition Top Map contains a next-generation future fusion CNVD that is termed the CNVD-Sensor Fusion (CNVD-SF).  SOF system planners are aware that such capabilities now exist in prototype form, but at prohibitive cost and weight.  Earlier spiral development acquisition planning estimated this capability for fielding in the 2012 time frame.  This estimate was based on the time that it would take industry to develop the CNVD-SF capability in a package under 2 pounds weight and $15,000-$20,000 per copy, these being the absolute maximum portability and affordability parameters acceptable to SOF for an individual small arms aiming system accessory intended for widespread fielding.  However, some recent informal industry and government estimates forecast the CNVD-SF capability at this size and price much earlier than 2012.   SYSTEM CONCEPT:  The below concepts represent a start-point for system information exchange among government, industrial, and academic interests.  The intent of this dialog is the eventual development of a future performance specification and possibly, a solicitation. a.  General System Summary:  The CNVD-SF will provide SOF combatants a “daylight-in-darkness” target acquisition and aiming capability.  The CNVD-SF may provide full-color or false-color output.  The output might be analogous to daylight when used during night, sandstorms, fog, and rain or in caves, tunnels, or dark structures.  A further objective of CNVD-SF might be to provide “better than daylight” optical features that enhance the SOF Operator’s ability to detect, locate, identify, and engage the enemy.  It will provide optimized target acquisition capabilities in different environmental conditions.  While the core client weapon systems envisioned for the CNVD-SF are carbines and machineguns, the CNVD-SF should be compatible with as many current and future SOF weapons/day optical sights as practical. The CNVD-SF should be ambidextrous in operation.  It should incorporate design features that maximize battery life.  The external housing should exhibit open architecture at!  tachment interface surfaces that provide space and footprint for the addition/accessorizing of future spiral-development capabilities, such as clip-on lasers, back-up sights, and rangefinders.  CNVD-SF should be miniature and highly portable, weighing less than 1 pound (Objective), 2 pounds (Threshold).  The CNVD-SF should have a production cost less than $15,000 (objective), $20,000 (threshold).  In addition to performance, portability and cost are envisioned as key factors in future source selection and determination of fielding quantities.  A rough fielding estimate would be from 5,000 to 20,000 systems for SOF, depending on cost and performance.  Interest also exists in the CNVD-SF system in other USG services and agencies.   b.  Fundamental Operational Concept:  The CNVD-SF has a single, most-important fundamental operational concept, and three (or more) less-important, but desirable supplemental concepts.  Fundamentally, the CNVD-SF is envisioned as a miniature, highly portable, collimated unity-power system that clips on the MILSTD 1913 rail space in front of the objective lens of existing daylight weapon sights.  It uses a quick-detach throw-lever type mount to attach to the MILSTD 1913 rail surface(s).  Its operational use is analogous that of the AN/PVS-22, the AN/PVS-24, and the SU-232/PAS, except that the CNVD-SF would be much more operationally effective than those earlier systems due to greatly enhanced target acquisition capability and miniaturization.   c.  First Supplemental Operational Concept: While the CNVD-SF is primarily conceived as an in-line or clip-on system that is placed in front of the objective lens of existing day optics, it might alternatively be considered for use as a stand-alone sight, if this feature is low-cost.  This stand-alone capability might allow the CNVD-SF to be used on unforeseen future weapons sighting applications.  If such supplemental stand-alone capability is found cost effective, the CNVD-SF could have programmable reticles, an intuitive menu-based system operation, and modular lens/digital magnifying power capabilities. d.  Second Supplemental Operational Concept: The CNVD-SF, when not in use as a weapon sight, could alternatively be used as a “pocket scope” or “monocular”, either alone or in conjunction with lasers, range finders, or other accessories that clip-on to the CNVD-SF housing.     e.  Third Supplemental Operational Concept:  The CNVD-SF could alternatively be mounted on a MILSPC 1913 rail arrangement in front of optical camera systems, and/or might have a digital imagery output interface. f.  Other Operational Concepts:  Responders to this announcement are invited to provide other capabilities or design features that may be of benefit to SOF Operators. TRL ASSESSMENT:  The Government is interested in conducting a TRL determination of the CNVD-SF with enhanced capabilities beyond those found currently in CNVD-type systems in the SOF field inventory and near-term development programs.  The government plans to conduct this TRL assessment through the evaluation of oral presentations, outdoor and indoor demonstrations, and in some cases, live fire range demonstrations.  The time and location of the TRL assessment is to be determined, currently planned for March or April 2006 at or near Coronado, California.  During this event, interested vendors may brief and demonstrate their research and prototype capabilities relevant to CNVD-SF in closed sessions to US Government representatives.  The government invites participating vendors/researchers to travel at their own expense to the TRL assessment site with their briefing(s), prototypes(s), and a self-supporting capability for batteries and other expendables.   The government will p!  rovide audio-visual support for oral presentations and range support to the extent practical.   f.  Scope of Presentations:  During the TRL assessment activity, Government representatives will engage in free dialog with the vendors, but without any commitment by the US Government or the vendors.  Each vendor will have approximately 3 hours to display, discuss and demonstrate concepts and prototypes(s).  While it is hoped that vendors can show fully working CNVD-SF prototypes, vendors are also invited to display working items or solid models that are not fully sensor-fusion capable, but which provide a platform for future adaptive design.   g.  Presentation Topics:  The discussions/presentations should be summarized in written hard-copy vendor handouts to facilitate note taking by vendor and USG participants.  Topics of discussion/presentation should be relevant to the development of the CNVD-SF and should, if possible, include predicted system characteristics, detection and identification performance, weight, battery life, operating modes, display features, system optical features, technical plans for miniaturization, cost/plans for production cost reduction, safety, maintenance, and field operation.  Vendors are requested to provide CNVD-SF prototype descriptions during oral presentations, to include the technical approach, prototyping or production history, any previous involvement by the US Government, test data, performance information, physical characteristics, estimated schedules, and estimated costs. Technical, schedule and cost risk should be identified and a preliminary risk mitigation approach discus!  sed.   h.  Vendor Coordination and Firing Safety:  If a particular system or prototype will be ready by the time of the TRL assessment for a day/night demonstration, either non-firing or live fire, the vendor should coordinate range, lighting, and target requests by the closing date stated below.  If live fire is appropriate, vendor representatives may be required to fire their own systems throughout all firing scenarios due to government safety restrictions.   i.  Intellectual Property:  The oral presentations, and if appropriate, range and live fire demonstrations will be scheduled in a secure, private environment to protect vendor Intellectual Property (IP).  Government attendees will sign non-disclosure agreements with the vendors, provided that USG legal authorities clear the text prior to the meeting.  The USG representatives will abide by all legal proprietary markings on vendor media left in USG possession.  The government has no interest at this point in the acquisition of vendor IP.  However, the government wishes to maintain open system architectures, and will have very limited interest in items that restrict future spiral development by using proprietary interfaces.  Prior to production, the government will most likely require drawings/production processes of open interfaces to establish Interface Control Documents (ICD’s) and allow for future competitive spiral developments and follow-on accessories. j. Participation:  This announcement is a public invitation by the government.  Failure to participate in this TRL assessment will not preclude vendors who do not attend from bidding on future solicitations for the CNVD-SF.  However, this announcement is part of the full-free-and-open competition process, which encourages industry and academia to help shape government specifications to match what is possible, affordable, and timely.  Failure to participate in this open dialog process may result in a government performance specification over which the abstaining vendors have limited influence in the acquisition process, and may deprive abstaining vendors of potentially valuable direct early interaction with end-users, contracting officials, and acquisition planners. k. Technical and Schedule Risk:  This TRL assessment activity contemplates development, production, and fielding of the CNVD-SF capability to combat units in a time frame relevant to ongoing hostilities.  As such, the USG participants will have limited to no interest in basic research or initial applied research presentations, unless a clear, rapid path to testing and production can be shown in the near term.   COMMENTS:  Interested vendors are requested to comment on this announcement, responding to the POC below by 30 December 2005.  A revised announcement will then be published to responsive parties that incorporates information gathered from the comments, to include a schedule for vendor presentations / demonstrations.  Please provide the information requested above by no later than 30 December 2005 to the technical Point of Contact (POC), Mr. Michael H. Jones.  Mr. Jones may be reached via e-mail at: michael.h.jones@navy.mil, or via phone at 812-854-6230.  Alternate Point of Contact is Mr. Fred E. Justis, e-mail: fred.justis@navy.mil, phone: 812-854-1292.  The mailing address is: NAVSURFWARCENDIV Crane, ATTN: Mr. Michael H. Jones, Code 4081, Bldg 2521, 300 Highway 361, Crane IN 47522-5001.  It should be noted that during the evaluation of all information submitted, the government plans to utilize employees from Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) and Wexford !  Group International (WGI), and possibly other direct Government contractors as advisors to the Government evaluators.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Air Combat Electronics Program Office (PMA209), is conducting a market survey seeking other government agencies, industry, academia, nonprofits, and Federal Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) partners for information to aid in the planning and development of the Common Avionics Display (CAD) program.  This is a Request for Information (RFI) only.  This is not a Request for Proposal or an indication that the Navy will contract for these supplies/services.  The Navy will not pay for information received in response to this RFI.  Specifically, the U.S. Navy seeks to obtain information relative to current and/or future avionics display capabilities that promote commonality across a wide range of applications.  Displays will be used in a wide variety of applications and installations ranging from primary flight in the open cockpit to tactical operations in crew consoles.  The forthcoming CAD program will look to begin a family of displays that employ open architecture principles to ensure total ownership costs are affordable for all level of requirements.  The CAD program will encompass displays that support both centralized and distributed processing avionics architectures.  Initial launch platforms for CAD will likely include helicopter and fixed-wing aircraft.  Platforms targeted for the Common Avionics Display could eventually include all legacy, in-production, and future aircraft.  Ideally, the CAD would be a modular and scalable system with an open architecture to enable commonality of major sub-components between the end-item displays used in different aircraft. For example, the same display head assembly module could be mated to two different Input/Output (I/O) modules and installed in two different aircraft performing vastly different functions.  The physical, electrical, and functional interfaces between these modules would be open, non-proprietary, based upon commercial standards, and easily implemented by third parties.  Any CAD design should greatly reduce development cycle time and cost for redeploying an end-item display for a new platform to include final integration.  The initial CAD family will be built upon the most advanced technologies available with improved optical performance (luminance ranges, contrast ratio, viewing angles, and NVIS compatibility), next generation processing performance, and high-bandwidth data/video interfaces.  Significantly increased MTBF is also a key requirement.  The modular nature of the system will ensure simplified technology insertion when new technologies become available.  For example, the display head assembly could be replaced with a form, fit, and function assembly based upon advanced concept technology in future years.  The information submitted on currently available or planned systems should provide demonstrated Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) figures for existing systems as well as predicted MTBFs for future systems.  Interested parties should be willing to participate in a Common Display Consortium led by the US Navy. This Consortium is intended to ensure that all Industry representatives have had a full opportunity to inform the Government with regard to the state of the technical art and to ensure that the Government has the full benefit of Industry information, opinion and expertise before undertaking the inherently governmental task of requirements definition.  It is expected that once the Government completes the requirements definition phase, a Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued.  Teaming arrangements among industry that promote the best combinations of technology, design expertise, production depth, and leadership will be encouraged for this program.  Based upon the above detailed description and basic requirement, the U.S. Navy requests interested sources to provide responses to the following:  1) Interested sources should identify how their existing solutions promote commonality, including what display / backlight technology is proposed to meet the wide range of requirements and even to push ahead of / advance current technologies.  Discuss the level of modularization proposed to meet the wide range of requirements.  Describe what interface technologies are proposed to support the modular design.  2) What the challenges are to fully realizing the Navy’s desired goal, and how they would meet the challenges?  3) What business / industrial strategy could be supported?  4) What is the Rough Order of Magnitude cost for this display?  5) What is the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) for any new proposed idea or technology?  The page limitation is requested to only 15 pages in order to effectively review each RFI response.  In addition, marketing literature may be provided.  Interested parties should provide responses with product/service specifications no later than 45 days from the date of this notice.  All information received in response to this announcement will be kept confidential.  This RFI does not guarantee selection for award of any contracts, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by NAVAIR to pay for the information solicited.  It is expected that the partner(s) being reviewed will provide (at no cost to NAVAIR) conceptual designs, technical data, proposal input, project schedules and cost estimates consistent with the requirements of the RFI.  Potential partners must demonstrate the capabilities and experience consistent with the efforts synopsized for the specified NAVAIR proposal.  All RFI responses should be sent to: Naval Air Systems Command, Attn: LCDR Karl Andina, 47123 Buse Road, Unit IPT, Bldg. 2272, Suite 351, Patuxent River, MD   20670-1547.  The preferred method of submission is via email to: Karl.Andina@navy.mil.  E-mail your technical questions to Mr. Gary Daelemans at: Gary.Daelemans@navy.mil.

<ARCHDATE>12042005

<DESC>The United States Air Force (USAF) Fourth Cliff Recreational Facility is located on the northern tip of Fourth Cliff in Scituate, Massachusetts, in the village of Humarock.  The Facility is bounded by private residents to the south, the Atlantic Ocea n to the east and the mouth of the North and South Rivers to the north and west.  Fourth Cliff is a drumlin comprised of glacial till, the slopes of which have experienced significant erosion for many years due to drainage of overland flow off the top of t he Cliff and also from wave action along the toe of the cliff during severe storms.  It has been estimated that the average erosion rate of Fourth Cliff has been 1-foot per year.  Left unprotected, the slopes will continue to slough and erode endangering t he Facility and Historic structures located on the top of the cliff.   The most recent study of the Fourth Cliff area was performed by Ocean and Coastal Consultants (OCC) and the Michael Baker Corporation in 2001.  This study identified the erosion of the cliff was due to rain runoff over the top edge of the cliff and wave ac tion during a storm surge.  The study evaluated several different shoreline stabilization alternatives for both the beach and the cliff.  Stabilization of the beach by placing sand on the beach was the first alternative evaluated.  Sources for the sand inc luded either utilizing dredge material from the North and South Rivers or by the placement of seabed scour mats anchored to the seabed floor just off shore. Stabilization of the coastal bank was also evaluated.  Alternatives included no action, providing a  sacrificial dune at the base of the cliff, reducing the slope of the cliff to a 1V:2H and providing drainage systems to divert water runoff from the slope areas, establishing a vegetative cover on the slope, and an armor stone toe protection.  The main de sign requirement is that the selected alternative would protect Fourth Cliff from a 100-year storm event.  As such, all the alternatives evaluated, except for armor stone, do not provide the protection required to withstand a 100- year storm event.  The re commeded solution was a combination of placing armor stone along the toe of the cliff, vegetating the upper slope, and providing a  drainage system to divert runoff off the slope.  A conceptual section which included these three components was developed. Additionally, the size of the armor stone was also calculated to range from 2.5 to 4.3 tons.   The United State Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), New England District, has been tasked by the USAF to prepare and execute a Design-Build Contract for a shoreline protection project at Fourth Cliff based on the findings of the OCC 2001 report.  Using the c onceptual design provided by OCC, USACE updated the cross section to conform to the design requirements set by USAF and current design standards of the USACE.  The contract will encompass the final design, layout, and construction of an armor stone toe wit h a vegetated upper slope.  The protection will tie into the existing slope at the property line on the south side (ocean side) and extend around the north point approximately 1200 feet where it will taper into the existing beach.  The stone revetment is d esigned to withstand a 100-year storm and includes an 8-foot thick layer of 5.3-ton armor stone extending from El 20ft-NGVD to El -4 ft-NGVD on a 1V:1.5H slope.  The slope from El 20 to the top of the cliff will be protected with a geosynthetic and vegetat ed to protect the upper slope from surface runoff erosion and sloughing.  The limiting factors driving the layout of the designed cross section include minimizing the impact to the intertidal zone and minimizing the cutback of the upper slope.   Material for construction of the revetment will be either barged to the site and or brought in by truck.  The staging area for materials will be on the South River (west) side of the cliff on the beach.  Placement of the armor stone and  bedding layers will require excavation of the existing beach.  Excavation and construction of the armor stone will be done in stages to limit open excavation areas for long periods of time and to protect sections of the project already built.  Material fr om the required excavations will be stockpiled and utilized to the extent possible as backfill material above the toe of the armor stone and also for the sacrificial berm. This acquisition will be issued on or about 10/15/2005 as a Request for Proposal that will be evaluated utilizing a Best Value Analysis.  It is anticipated that award will be made by March 2006.  The estimated range is $5,000,000 - $10,000,000.  Firms that  are interested in competing for this project as Prime Contractors are requested to submit a letter of interest indicating whether their firm is a Large Business (LB), Small Business (SB), Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), HUBZone Small Business (HSB), S ervice-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVSB), SBA 8(a)small Business (8(a)).  Letters of interest should be sent to the attention of Rachael Raposa at U. S. Army Engineer District, New England, 696 Virginia Road, Concord, MA 01742-2751, by fax at 9 78-318-8207, or by email to Rachael.Raposa @usace.army.mil no later than 10/05/2005.

<SUBJECT>USV Workshop Announcement
<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, San Diego (SSC San Diego), and the Naval Undersea Warfare Center Newport (NUWC NPT) in support of the Naval Sea Systems Command (PMS 420) will conduct a Workshop on Unmanned Surface Vessels (USVs).  The Workshop falls under the auspices of an SSC San Diego Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), no. N66001-05-X-6052, as synopsized on 11 July 2005. Specific interest areas in the BAA in which USV efforts fall include: control systems and software to support sensors and unmanned operation; and adaptations of small craft design which may better support such sensor systems. The Workshop has been scheduled for October 18-20, 2005, 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM, at a TBD location in the Washington, D.C. Metro area.  (The specific location will be posted at the SSC San Diego e-Commerce Central website NLT 29 September 2005.)  The length of the Workshop is anticipated to be three days.  The Workshop will consist of a three hour plenary session during which the government will present some briefing material on USVs.  Following the plenary session individual contractors will have an opportunity (20-30 minutes based on attendance) to brief a government-only panel on their ideas for designing and building a USV.  During these sessions the Government panel may ask questions of clarification but will not respond to questions. In anticipation of the Workshop, a set of documents, related to USVs, including important interface considerations, performance goals and Government experience in the area of USVs, will be posted on the SSC San Diego e-Commerce Central website https://e-commerce.spawar.navy.mil/.  Attendance at the USV Workshop will be set up on a first come, first serve basis, however we will try to accommodate requests due to travel distance as much as possible.  If you would like to attend the USV Workshop, please submit an email to the point of contact indicated at the bottom of this announcement 10 days prior to the start of Industry Day with a list of attendees.  Due to space limitations, knowledge of attendees is critical.  Following the Workshop, contractors who wish their proposals to be considered on this topic should submit proposals not later than 22 November 2005.  These proposals will be evaluated as a group and will have a greater chance of being funded than proposals received after 22 November 2005. The Government intends to award one (1) procurement contract for a twenty-four (24) month period of performance to develop, fabricate and test two (2) prototype USV platforms, trailers and two (2) host workstations not including radio communication equipment.  Radio sets will be provided as Government furnished property to the successful offeror.  The Government expects delivery of two (2) prototype USVs and supporting design, maintenance and operation documentation to begin integration with Sonar Sensor Mission systems thirteen (13) months after contract award.  The contract will include a future option for the fabrication of two (2) additional prototype USV platforms including trailers, based on the basic design.  The option could be exercised up to ten (10) months after award of the contract. It is not necessary to attend the USV Workshop in order to propose a design and build effort.  The main purpose will be for clarification. A transcript of questions and answers resulting from both plenary session and individual contractor sessions of the Workshop will be posted to the SSC San Diego e-Commerce Central website following each of the meetings.  This USV Workshop announcement does not change the original BAA. Proposals will be accepted under the BAA until 11 July 2006. Information on the proposal format is included in the BAA announcement. Questions of a contractual or technical nature should be directed to Ms. Sylvia Evans, SSC San Diego Code 225, via e-mail: sylvia.evans@navy.mil or telephone (619) 553-3292.  Questions and resultant responses will be posted to the website for general access.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for Thermal Protection Systems (TPS) test coupons in support of heatshield development for the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV). NASA Ames is requesting commercial vendors to propose relatively mature CEV heatshield TPS materials, heatshield TPS design and fabrication methodologies, and TPS attachment and integration approaches suitable for the environments consistent with Lunar Return (Block II), which are anticipated to reach heat flux levels as high as 1000 W/cm2 and surface pressures of up to 0.7 atm.  Candidate TPS materials shall have documented performance in similar aero-convective environments, either in laboratory (TRL 4) or flight (TRL 5+) (see Appendix 1 for a description of Technical Readiness Levels).  Evaluation of qualified commercial TPS vendors will be based on information identifying and detailing potential heatshield TPS design and fabrication capabilities enabling NASA evaluation of:  a) Industry interest and capabilities for heatshield TPS materials;  b) Processing implications for a TPS solution applicable to a 5.5m diameter heatshield; and,  c) Level of TPS implementation readiness through review of existing:  i) Performance test data in relevant environments;  ii) Material characterization information;  iii) Process descriptions for quality assurance, inspection and repair.  All offerors who can provide TPS materials and manufacturing processes that are consistent with TRL 4 will provide the following in their proposals:  1. A firm fixed price quote for January 9, 2006 delivery of material coupons for independent testing in a NASA Arc Jet facility in the second quarter (January through March) of Fiscal Year 2006 (see Appendix 2 for coupon quantity, dimensions and thickness sizing criteria);  2. A firm fixed price quote for February 3, 2006 delivery of material coupons for independent testing in NASA flexural loading fixtures (see Appendix 3 for coupon quantity, dimensions and thickness sizing criteria);  3. A Preliminary Heatshield Implementation Plan (see plan requirements below); and,  4. A firm fixed price quote for preparation of a Detailed Heatshield Implementation Plan (the Detailed Heatshield Implementation Plan itself is required to be delivered 90 days after contract award). Heatshield Implementation Plan Requirements:  Please address the following topics as thoroughly as practical in your Preliminary Heatshield Implementation Plans.  Complete coverage with considerable detail will be expected in the Detailed Heatshield Implementation Plans. 1. A description of the candidate heatshield TPS material(s) and fabrication approach:  a. Ablative TPS materials to be used for the heatshield;  b. Ablative TPS material physical properties and characteristics, mechanical properties (strain to failure), capabilities, test and flight heritage at conditions of 1000W/cm2 or greater.  2. Methodology for design and fabrication of the TPS for a full-scale heatshield system:  a. Discuss how the TPS material will be attached to the support structure;  b.

The acquisition will be conducted as a three-phased procurement using a competitive down-selection technique between phases.  In this technique, multiple contractors will be selected for Phase 1.  It is expected that up to three contractors for Phase 2 will be chosen from among these contractors after a competitive down-selection.  It is expected that the single contractor for Phase 3 will be chosen from among these contractors after a competitive down-selection. (b) Phase 1 is for definition and conceptual design activities, including TPS material performance assessments, manufacturing plan development, Concept Refinement, and focused trade studies and analysis.  Phase 2 is for Full-scale manufacturing demonstration, Preliminary and Detailed Design, High-fidelity TPS material response model development.  Phase 3 is for Detailed Design leading to full-scale manufacture of qualification test articles and flight test articles. (c) The competition for Phase 2 will be based on the results of Phase 1, and the award criteria for Phase 2 will include successful completion of Phase 1 requirements.  The competition for Phase 3 will be based on the results of Phase 2, and the award criteria for Phase 3 will include successful completion of Phase 2 requirements.  (d) NASA will issue a separate, formal solicitation for Phases 2 and 3 that will include all information required for preparation of proposals, including the final evaluation factors. (e) Phases 2 and 3 will be synopsized in the Commerce Business Daily (CBD) in accordance with FAR 5.201 and 5.203 unless one of the exceptions in FAR 5.202 applies.  Notwithstanding NASA's expectation that only the Phase 1 contractors will be capable of successfully competing for Phase 2 and only the Phase 2 contractors will be capable of successfully competing for Phase 3, all proposals will be considered.  Any other responsible source may indicate its desire to submit a proposal by responding to the Phase 2 or Phase 3 synopsis, and NASA will provide that source a solicitation. (f) To be considered for Phase 2 award, offerors must demonstrate design maturity equivalent to that of the Phase 1 contractors.	This demonstration shall include the following Phase 1 deliverables upon which Phase 2 award will be based:	TPS material performance under relevant aerothermal/attachment tests, full-scale manufacturing plan reasonableness and realism, and TPS heatshield design trade studies.  Failure to fully and completely demonstrate the appropriate level of design maturity may render the proposal unacceptable with no further consideration for contract award. (g) The following draft Phase 2 evaluation factors are provided for your information.  Please note that these evaluation factors are not final, and NASA reserves the right to change them at any time up to and including the date upon which Phase 2 proposals are solicited. 1.	The contractor’s Phase 1 cost and schedule performance, measured against the final, adjusted baseline. 2.	The quality, completeness and design maturity of the contractor’s concept refinement, SRR products, and focused trade studies and analysis.  3.	Contractor’s proposal for phase 2, including: a.

A description of remaining technical risks and the contractor’s risk mitigation plan. (h) Although NASA will request Phase 2 proposals from Phase 1 contractors and Phase 3 proposals from Phase 2 contractors, submission of the Phase 2 proposal is not a requirement of the Phase 1 contract, nor is submission of the Phase 3 proposal a requirement for the Phase 2 contract.  Accordingly, the costs of preparing these proposals shall not be a direct charge to the Phase 1 contract or any other Government contract. (i) The anticipated schedule for conducting this phased procurement is provided for your information.  These dates are projections only and are not intended to commit NASA to complete a particular action at a given time.

<DESC>Decision Matrix
Hiring contract employees for Test Administration 
Education center – MacDill AFB
a/o 2005

Education - MIB
	HS Diploma 					= 0
	AA Diploma 					= 2
	BA/BS Diploma 				= 4
	BA/BS Education related 			= 5
	BA/BS Counseling related			= 6
	MA/MS Diploma 				= 8
	MA/MS Diploma Ed/Counseling related	= 10

Experience - MIB
None / Unsuccessful work history						= 0
	Successful, but not in a related field						= 2 
	Successful in a related field, but not within the military/government	= 4
	Successful in a related field that is with the military/governmental		= 6
	Successful in exactly same job with a DoD Education Center		= 8

Cost - MIB (bid price)
	Rank order candidates with highest bid awarded a 1, 2nd highest bid awarded a 2 and so on.  The lowest cost bid will be at the top of the list and will receive a score equal to the total number of candidates.  

Interview Results - MIB (phone, resume, meetings and etc.)
	Leadership interview candidates and/or evaluate resume packages to determine an order of merit list.   Most effective resume package is placed at the top of the list and least effective resume package is placed at the bottom of the list.   Bottom candidate is awarded a 1, second from bottom is awarded a 2 and so on.

References – MIB (Personal observations, written, phone and etc.)
	Candidates’ references will be rank ordered in an order of merit list by leadership with the worst reference awarded a 1 and the best reference awarded a score equal to the total number of candidates.

Instructions for scoring ties on an order of merit list
In the event of an exact tie such as a contract bid, those candidates are awarded the same exact final score.   To determine that score first determine the location scores on the OML for all tied candidates.  Then divide the total of those tied location scores by number of tied individuals.  As an example:  if two candidates are have the submitted the highest bids at exactly the same cost then those two candidates are tied for the 1st and 2nd positions on the merit list.  The value of those positions is 1 and 2 points.  1 point + 2 points = 3 points.   3 points / two candidates = 1.5 points   Therefore these two tied candidates would be awarded 1.5 points each.
****!! To all prospective offerors, the attach document is the matrix on how the decision will be made for award. Please base your bid on the price for the number of sessions not per hour(s). 

The deadline for submission will not be extended!!!!

It is understood that FedBid ranks all bids by price, regardless of the evaluation criteria used by the buyer. Buyers and Sellers understand that a Buyer always maintains all rights assigned under their contracting authority and/or applicable acquisition regulations, and may select the most advantageous bid for the governments purpose while considering offline factors such as delivery, past performance, socio-economic classifications, and source rotation. Sole Source Justification: This equipment is used to detect anthrax.  Cepheid is the sole manufacturer of technology contained in GeneExpert, a stand-alone, portable biohazard detection (BDS) device capable of performing reliable, accurate, hands-off, on-site testing, with results available within 45 minutes.  The GeneXpert is the only known equipment/technology that can be used by non-technical staff using automatic sample processing techniques.  This equipment is commercially available. The GeneExpert is the only equipment approved for use by the U.S. Postal Service and is licensed by the U.S. Army Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) to use BA4 plex assay for Bacillus anthrax detection. No other known equipment/technology has received this approval. The GeneExpert uses the same equipment/technology contained in Northrup Grumman (NG) BDS equipment, which the Department already purchased and intends on using at the SA32 pouch facility in conjunction with high speed mail sorting equipment.  These stand-alone GeneExpert units are currently in use within the Department to screen the Secretary?s mail and all other mail received at the SA32 pouch facility.  This specific equipment was required prior to using the NG equipment to train staff, gain experience with testing procedures involved with this technology and also perform testing of packages that are not processed through high speed mail sorters. Since this is a stand-alone unit, it can be easily deployed to posts overseas.  These specific units will be sent to posts with no, or very limited access to testing laboratories. The GeneExpert units will give them the ability to test for anthrax and receive results within 45 minutes. The 45 minute response time is essential to the protection of overseas personnel. GeneExpert equipment is required to maintain uniformity among the Department?s anthrax testing equipment, to standardize training and be able to use existing supplies of unique testing cartridges that have a limited shelf life. Without this equipment, a serious worldwide contamination risk exists, which could result in death and loss of essential diplomatic facilities overseas.
