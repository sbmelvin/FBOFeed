This is the only system with the AxIEM system, which is the industry’s only electromagnetic option for neuro-navigation. This technology is new and allows the doctor to track the tip of the instrument (catheter) instead of just targeting the navigation spot of interest as with all other navigation systems on the market.  This acquisition is being conducted under the FAR 13.5 test procedures for commercial items. Provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-24 are incorporated.

The system shall be able to interface with multiple intraoperative imaging systems. The voltage requirements are 120V, 60Hz, and single phase.

Regulatory Requirements:  The system and all of the components, shall be compliant with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements to market and deliver medical products for use in the United States of America, even should delivery be requested outside of the United States.  The claims made for the product shall comply with the regulations of the FDA with respect to products for marketing and delivery of a medical product for use in the United States of America, even should delivery be requested outside of the United States.


Items being purchased in this acquisition:
Navigation System (1)

This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures.  There are no set-aside restrictions for this requirement. The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 423450 with a Small Business Size Standard of 500 employees.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for this requirement.  However, parties interested in responding to this notice shall submit technical data, including cost, sufficient to determine capability in providing the same product. All capability statements received by closing of this notification of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

Based on the above information, the only technically acceptable system is provided by Medtronic, Inc.

Submit email capability statements (using PDF, MS Word, Excel attachments) to Courtney Piar at Courtney.piar@med.navy.mil. Fax quotes may be sent to 301-619-1132 Attn: Courtney Piar.

<CONTACT>Jerry Riles, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-767-0667, Email jerry.riles@nrl.navy.mil
<DESC>The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) intends to negotiate a contract on the basis of Other Than Full and Open Competition IAW 10 USC 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source. The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) has a requirement for a submerged launch unmanned aerial system (UAS) that is capable of stealthy persistent surveillance. The XFC (eXperimental Fuel Cell) meets the UAS requirement. A submerged launch system for the XFC has been designed and a full-scale mockup system has been built and tested. This requirement is for engineering services for the development of a Temporary Alteration (TEMPALT) and build-out of the UAS delivery/launch system. This TEMPALT is specifically directed toward the delivery of airborne intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capability on a US nuclear submarine platform. NRL requires contractor engineering and equipment support in the build out and testing of the demonstration deliverable of the Launch Canister System (LCS, also known as Sea Robin), including the integration of an existing prototype launch system pressure vessel (PV) that is a major component of the LCS. NRL will negotiate with Oceaneering International, Inc, 7001 Dorsey Road, Hanover, MD 21076-1553. Oceaneering has been integral in the preliminary design and modeling phases of this program and the cost and loss of time for another vendor to complete this work would be prohibitive. OII is unique in their experience and expertise of submarine launched fiber optic tethered controlled vehicles. They are the only company who have provided and successfully deployed a submarine TEMPALT approved torpedo tube launched remotely operated vehicle which uses a fiber optic tether. They are the only company that has demonstrated fiber optic tether management able to withstand a full impulse launch from a torpedo tube. The tether is used for command, control and communications between the submarine and the XFC-Sea Robin. Additionally, OII has the patent (pending) that covers the required fiber optic tether control system. OII is the only company to have designed, developed and produced the submerged launch vehicle needed in support of the Navy's Fuel Cell Submerged Launched UAS. The Launch Canister System with its UAS Pressure Vessel vehicle is one-of-a-kind technology. Support engineering and system and subsystem assembly requires an in-depth understanding of undersea systems including materials chemistry and mechanical properties, asset and human safety design and certification and complete familiarity with the existing prototype system. Only OII has this capability and know-how as it is unique to this vehicle. <br />Other business opportunities for NRL are available at our website http://heron.nrl.navy.mil/contracts/rfplist.htm.<br />

<DESC>"This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposals abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small business; HubZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small business; woman-owned small business; or small disadvantaged business; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your response to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice." We encourage teaming. The Office of Purchasing and Contracts does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses received nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted.
<p>This Sources Sought Notice (SS) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Government.</p>
<p>Interested parties are expected to review this Notice and the draft Statement of Work to familiarize yourself with the requirements of this project; failure to do so will be at your firm's own risk.</p>
<p>As a result of this Sources Sought Notice, the Office of Purchasing and Contracts may issue a Request for Quote (RFQ). THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against the Office of Purchasing and Contracts (OPC) shall arise as a result of a response to this Sources Sought Notice or the Office of Purchasing and Contracts use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.<br />In the event an RFQ is issued, North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 334516 with a size standard of 500 employees is being considered.</p>
<p>Purpose:<br />The purpose of this project is to locate a provider who can provide the Clinical Center, PET Department with an upgraded DID GC that is an exact physical replacement for an existing Gas Chromatograph model (GOW MAC 590 GC) (See draft SOW). <br />The acquired upgraded is vitally important to our ability to ensure that the NIH PET Drugs we produce continue to meet all the prescribed and appropriate standards of strength, quality, and purity set forth. The Gas Chromatograph must interface with the existing GOW-MAC DID GC and must meet NIH's specifications.</p>
<p>GOW-MAC Instrument Company is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the Series 590 DID Gas Chromatographs. The Series 590 DID is manufactured and designed for the use and analysis of ultra low-level impurities in gases. This instrument contains GOW MAC's patented Discharge Ionization Detector more commonly known as a DID. GOW-MAC Instrument Co is the worldwide designer of the detector in the Series 590 DID Gas Chromatograph. The detector uses an electrical discharge in helium to generate high-energy UV photons and metastable helium, which ionizes all compounds except helium.</p>
<p>GOW-MAC utilizes bellows type metering valves, orbitally welded connections and VCR fittings. The electronics for Series 590 DID GC consist of a high voltage detector power supply and electrometer amplifies. The Gas Chromatograph DID power supply provides high voltage necessary to produce the ionization arc in the DID.</p>
<p>This high sensitivity and stability of the DID is ideal for the analysis of target gases used in the production of PET Drugs. Due to the high radioactivity levels of the gases employed the column oven must be shielded and the instrument electronic control must be separated from the oven to allow remote operation without exposure to radioactivity. GOW MAC is the only company who manufactures GC in this configuration must fit into our existing custom lead shielded cabinet<br />If any other interested party believes that it can meet the requirements it may submit a statement of capabilities and qualifications as outlined above which will be considered by the NIH. Additionally, the capability statement should identify the Type of Company (i.e., small business, 8 (a), woman-owned, veteran owned, etc.) as validated via the Central Contractor Registration (CCR).<br />However, all information received within ten (10) days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon reasons to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>A copy of the draft Statement of Work (SOW) for all technical requirements and specifications, is subject to revisions, may be accessed in the attachment.</p>
<p>The original document must be readily accessible for date stamping purposes.</p>
<p>Facsimile responses will not be accepted.<br />Reponses should be submitted by no later than July 20, 2010 to Diania Robinson, Office of Purchasing and Contracts, Clinical Center, 6707 Democracy Boulevard, Suite 106, Bethesda, Maryland.

Contractors interested in this requirement should submit clear and convincing evidence that they can meet the Government’s requirement.  The IRS anticipates a sole source award to Software AG USA, Inc.  The IRS is purchasing the items listed below.  A more detailed description is provided in the attached FY10-11 Statement of Work.

Vendors are invited to provide a proposal for line items 0001-0016. Clarification for CLIN 0017: The vendor is allowed a one-time fee for compliance with Contractor Manpower Reporting (CMR).  Contractor Manpower Reporting is an Army Initiative and System that was implemented on Mar 8, 2005. It is a business process designed to obtain better visibility of the contractor service workforce from Contractors supporting the Army. The process was created to collect information on funding source, contracting vehicle, organization supported, mission and function performed, and labor hours and costs for contracted efforts. Contractor Manpower Reporting (CMR) is a mandatory Department of the Army directive that must be completed if you win the award (only about a 15 minute process including time to register in the website). Therefore, every vendor must submit a bid for it. If you are unsure of what dollar amount would be best to quote, you may charge an hourly rate or a flat rate (one set rate no matter how long the process takes). You may also opt to waive the fee, completing the fee at no cost to the Government. Remember the CMR Reporting Fee is considered a competitive line item, so it will drive your quote. Please read the implementation language below, it will include the web-site address in which the information is entered.  The Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Manpower & Reserve Affairs) operates and maintains a secure Army data collection site where the contractor will report ALL contractor manpower (including subcontractor manpower) required for performance of this contract.  The contractor is required to completely fill in all the information in the format using the following web address:  https://cmra.mil. Reporting period will be the period of performance not to exceed 12 months ending 30 Sep of each government fiscal year. IMPORTANT!!!
