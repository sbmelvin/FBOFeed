<CONTACT>JEFF CARAVELLI CONTRACTING SPECIALIST 9162789341     jcaravelli@usgs.gov;
<DESC>In 2004, the United States Geological Survey, Alaska Volcano Observatory (USGS) acquired several broadband digital-output seismometers through full and open competition (solicitation 04WRQQ0104; contract 04WRCN0010).  The successful contractor was Digital Technology Associates, Inc. of Concord, CA (DTA) and the selected product was the Guralp Systems Limited (Guralp) CMG-6TD.  The USGS currently operates a telemetered network of twelve (12) Guralp CMG-6TDs and has eight (8) more for temporary deployments. In 2006, the Augustine eruption (see http://www.avo.alaska.edu/activity/Augustine.php) damaged or destroyed seven (7) of the above-described seismometers.  The USGS intends to replace these items through a noncompetitive procurement to DTA, the sole U.S. distributor of Guralp products, in accordance with (IAW) Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 13.106-1(b)(1) and the procedures of FAR Part 12, entitled "Acquisition of Commercial Items."  Other interested concerns having the ability to meet the USGS' requirement may submit a capabilities statement to the Contracting Officer no later than the closing date of this announcement at 17:00 local time.  All submissions will be evaluated to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  If no competitive opportunities exist, request for quotation (RFQ) 07WRQQ0016 will be made available to DTA through the Government-wide Point of Entry (GPE) on or about 09 January 2007, IAW FAR 5.102(a)(1). This notice and any resulting solicitation or contract conforms to the requirements in place through FAC 2005-14, effective 22 November 2006. For further information, please contact the Contracting Officer at (916) 278-9341 or jcaravelli@usgs.gov. NAICS 334519 - Other Measuring and Controlling Device Manufacturing.

Attached:  Scope of Services - LWCF Database Management Support Services RFQ No. Q224007004 The National Park Service requires database management services for the administration of the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) state grant-in-aid program.  The LWCF requires part-time support services of an experienced LWCF database manager.  The duties required include maintaining essential updates, user training, ad hoc reporting and system maintenance for the LWCF program; Place of performance:  	National Park Service 			National Center for Recreation & Conservation 			1201 I Street, NW 			Washington, DC  20005 Work Hours:  Part-time (Approximately 16 hours per week). Performance Period:  Base year with two 1 year option periods. Start Date:  February 1, 2006 General Requirements and Overview:  The State and Local Assistance Programs Division, National Park Service, requires specialized automated data processing (ADP) support for the management of the LWCF grant programs (general information http://www.nps.gov/lwcf).  The LWCF database serves as a repository for individual grant information including both project statistical and financial data.  On-going grant funding requires daily monitoring, preparation of special OMB statistical reports and weekly on-site technical support service (data back-ups, financial data merges). Support Activities:  o LWCF grant data (legacy and current) is stored and maintained on two SQL Servers in the Data Center and the data is maintained through a web based application by Regional Offices and State officials. This data is updated daily and accessed by the general public as well as NPS program officers and State grant managers. The LWCF database application (CRYSTAL REPORTS XI) provides both standard and ad hoc reporting capability with expansion capability (see http://www.nps.gov/lwcf for examples of three (3) standard public reports currently accessible to all of the above).  o Support activities include providing on-going technical support to recreation grant managers and staff to ensure a functional grant management tool is developed and maintained to meet administrative needs and legal requirements of the LWCF program. o Providing on-going technical support to recreation grant managers and staff to assure a functional grant management tool is developed to meet administrative needs and legal requirements of the LWCF program using contractors.  o Specifically oversees the LWCF apportionment calculations to assure "State" funding in accordance to the law or to otherwise run scenario funding as requested by U.S. Congressional staff. o Facilitate communications between contractors, grant managers and technical staff in order to assure that the resulting automated LWCF System meets the program requirements using contracted services. Special guidance is required to develop and meet deadlines to establish OMB's Performance Assessment Rating Tool (PART) goals to measure program achievements as directed by OPM. o Facilitate the monthly AOC merge and otherwise assuring that system back ups are maintained on the LWCF servers and to facilitate the transition other grant duties to other staff members.  LWCF financial data is imported on a monthly basis via e-mail attachment in text file format from the NPS Accounting Operations Center (AOC). This AOC migration process has been developed to enable most recent monthly financial data to be merged easily into the primary LWCF database. This procedure updates all financial changes by AOC since the last data merge. Records unmatched to a grant identifier are held in a file and become part of the next update process. This monthly migration must be done using the internet access directly on the servers located in the on site Data Center. o Must have a thorough and broad understanding of the LWCF program, be completely knowledgeable about the grant data informational system as it relates to management's needs to carry out the program and  provide a high level of computer technical and specific database expertise so that the resulting informational product fully meets the needs of the program through the Contractor's work.  o May require travel to Regional Offices, as needed.  If travel is required, the Contractor shall be reimbursed through the contract in accordance with the Federal Travel Regulations and will be approved in advance by the Contracting Officer. o These duties will require one to two days a week, with approximately 80 percent time available on site, or as needed. o The Contractor shall provide basic support for both hardware (servers) and software. The on-going developmental changes in data entry procedures and ad hoc reporting needs ideally require the experience and historical knowledge of these recreation grant programs. Hardware Support Requirements:  Two existing servers (SQL Server 2000) must be maintained to assure online web-based database service is available nationwide 24 hours a day.  A fail-safe backup system must be maintained to assure no loss of data for all but the last 24 hours of data entry activity.  The Contractor shall be directly responsible for ensuring server maintenance. The Government shall furnish office space, computer, phone, and any necessary office supplies to support the tasks described in this statement of work.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<SUBJECT>D -- NAIS Increment 2 Draft SOW and PSPEC
<DESC>THIS IS A PRESOLICITATION NOTICE.  The U.S. Coast Guard announces release of a DRAFT Statement of Work and Performance Specification to acquire contractor system integration and technical support services for Increment 2 of the Nationwide Automatic Identification System (NAIS).  

NAIS will use international-standard Automatic Identification System (AIS) technology for ship-to-ship, ship-to-shore and shore-to-ship communication of navigation information to support Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) ?  the effective understanding of anything associated with the global maritime environment that could affect the security, safety, economy, or environment of the United States.   NAIS will provide the ability to receive AIS broadcasts from ships and other AIS users and use the message data, along with other data, to improve MDA.  NAIS will also provide the ability to leverage other AIS capabilities, such as sending AIS messages to ships.  

NAIS will consist of an integrated system of AIS (e.g., base station transceivers, antennas), data storage and processing, and networking infrastructure.  NAIS will also be integrated with other systems for the purpose of sharing infrastructure, more quickly implementing NAIS capabilities, and improving performance (e.g., minimizing duplication of user interfaces).  NAIS will send and receive AIS messages, via the Very High Frequency (VHF) Data Link (VDL), to and from AIS equipped vessels, Aids to Navigation (AtoN), and Search and Rescue (SAR) aircraft.  NAIS will leverage several types of platforms to support AIS receive and transmit infrastructure.  While some will support receive-only capabilities (e.g., satellites, buoys, and aircraft), others will support both receive and transmit capabilities (e.g., towers and platforms).  AIS message data will be transported between system components over a wide-area network (WAN) and diverse, remote site connectivity (e.g., leased analog circuits, microwave, etc.).

NAIS will provide the capability to receive AIS data transmitted from AIS-equipped vessels for the purpose of tracking their movements within U.S. navigable waters and out to 2000 nautical miles offshore while also monitoring the proper operation of the AIS system.  NAIS will provide a transmission capability to support these missions as well, including transmission of navigational safety and security information to AIS-equipped vessels, and management of AIS frequency usage.  Through the provision of these capabilities, NAIS will support the DHS strategic goals of Awareness, Prevention, Protection, and Response.  NAIS capability will provide the following operational functions:

?Receipt and transmission of AIS information in order to detect, identify, monitor and track AIS-equipped vessels and to communicate data to and from shore side and shipboard AIS equipment.

?Network services to enable conveyance of data between shore side AIS equipment, processing equipment and command and control (C2) systems and interoperability with such systems.

?Data management capabilities, including data processing, recording, retrieval, warehousing and analysis.

?Interoperability and interface with a variety of command and control systems, including user interfaces for situation display, analysis and control of the system.

NAIS is primarily intended to be a provider of information and capability that will be accessed, used, and controlled via other systems.  To this end, interoperability is an important requirement of NAIS.  In particular, it is intended that display of AIS data, data correlation and fusion, and control of AIS functionality will be performed by non-NAIS systems. Therefore, interoperability and support of enhancements to these systems will be critical.  Some of these systems are classified; however, NAIS will operate solely within the Sensitive but Unclassified (SBU) domain, but with the capability to provide data to higher security systems.

The NAIS system will be implemented with an approach including the following three incremental capabilities:

1.	Receive Only in Critical Ports and Coastal/Near-Coastal Areas
2.	Coastal Transmit and Receive Nationwide
3.	Long Range Receive Nationwide

The above incremental capabilities are linked such that ultimately, through the implementation of all three, complete nationwide and long range coverage of AIS capability as described in this solicitation will be achieved.  The primary benefit of an incremental implementation approach is that maritime security stakeholders will receive useful capability more quickly than would be otherwise possible.  Implementing NAIS in the three increments listed above will also help to address technical, logistical and budgetary risks that would be more difficult to manage without an incremental approach.  

Increment 1, already in development, will provide the capability to receive AIS messages within critical ports and coastal areas.  This increment is intended to meet immediate operational needs and align with the anticipated expansion of AIS carriage requirements.  Localized coverage gaps will be minimized, but will be accepted on a case-by-case basis based on sponsor guidance and cost benefit trade-off analyses.  These potential gaps will be filled with the capability provided by later increments.  Support for this increment will be provided to the extent necessary to meet required availability.

Increment 2 will expand both the capability and coverage of AIS deployed in the first increment.  This increment includes the ability of the system to receive AIS messages within 50 nautical miles (nm) of the baseline and to transmit AIS messages to vessels out to 24 nm of the baseline, nationwide.

The USCG would like to obtain industry comments regarding the DRAFT SOW and PSPEC.  These comments will be used to refine the final Request for Proposal (RFP).  Questions received from industry on or before January10, 2007 may be addressed during the USCG meeting with industry (or in the final RFP, at the discretion of the U.S. Government).  The USCG will treat all responses as confidential; however, Offerors SHOULD NOT provide proprietary business information at this time.   Questions answered during the meeting with industry will be unattributed and paraphrased so that the submitter will remain anonymous. 

In addition to requesting industry review of the DRAFT SOW AND PSEC, the USCG requests industry's response to the list of questions titled Questions for Industry.  Answers to these specific questions will greatly assist the USCG in the development of the final RFP.  As with comments submitted on the DRAFT SOW and PSEC, the USCG will treat all responses as confidential; however, Offerors SHOULD NOT provide proprietary business information at this time.

The Pre-Solicitation Conference is tentatively scheduled to be held at the Crystal City Marriot in Arlington, Virginia on January 18, 2007 from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM.  If you would like to attend, please contact Mrs. Lillie Carter at lillie.b.carter@uscg.mil no later than January 10, 2007 to register.  All attendees must register.

<SUBJECT>A -- DMID Clinical Trial Management
<DESC>The Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with PPD Development, Inc., to continue performing Clinical Trials Management support for an additional two years, as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  The proposed award represents a continuation of work originally awarded in 2003 to PPD Development Inc., under Contract N01-AI-30068.

Under the current contract, PPD is providing support in the following areas:  protocol writing, development and review; pharmacovigilance and safety oversight; clinical site monitoring and site assessment; quality management and third party audits; GCP training for DMID program staff and funded investigators; information management services and web site development and support; meeting planning and support; and a subcontract for H5 avian flu laboratory assays.     

The scope of work required that PPD provide infrastructure development to support DMID?s clinical research.  PPD developed this infrastructure de novo, specifically the customization of a clinical trials management tracking database, development of a centralized pharmacovigilance and safety oversight systems. This customized database is critical to DMID?s ability to track the status of over 400 protocols worldwide and the data transfer of over 125 protocols to the National Library of Medicine's ClinicalTrials.gov registry.  The development of this infrastructure required more time and effort than originally anticipated.   Interruption to these activities would have a significant impact on DMID's ability to meet the urgent demands of the pandemic H5 avian flu clinical research, as well as other Category A, B and C priority pathogen clinical research support. 

In addition, since the time of the award, the volume of clinical research performed by DMID has increased significantly due to growing biodefense efforts (e.g., smallpox, anthrax, and tularemia) and the urgency to perform pandemic and seasonal influenza vaccine research.  At the time of award, it was not anticipated that PPD would be providing support to such a high volume of high visibility clinical trials conducted with the intent for FDA licensure.  As a result, the amount of work increased dramatically due to the increased intensity of support required for these trials. 

Therefore, DMID has determined PPD is the only responsible source to provide the complex and integrated support services to meet DMID clinical research demands at this time.  If the clinical trials management support contract were awarded to another contractor at this time, it would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements on account of the vast interruption and inconsistency in oversight of the clinical research work conducted by DMID.

Therefore, no other service will satisfy DMID's requirements.  If there are responsible sources who feel that they are able to perform the requirement, they must respond by submitting the information required by Numbered Note 22 on/before the closing date noted in this announcement. Organizations that submit capability statements in response to this announcement must demonstrate their ability to assume the work without unnecessary delay and duplication of cost and effort. You are directed to Government-Wide Numbered Notes 22 and 26.  No collect calls will be accepted.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation,Request for Quotes number W81XWH-07-T-0013, for commercial products, prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcem ent constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) in behalf of the U.S. Army Medical Materiel Center, Europe (USAMMCE) and othe r activities of the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) with veterinary activities that have recurring requirements for pet food, intends to award a sole source contract with Hills Pet Nutrition, Inc, Topeka, Kansas for Hills Pet Fo od Science and Prescription Diet product lines. Most of these products are issued by USAMMCE to fulfill needs at veterinary clinics in Europe, Iraq and Afghanistan and other areas of the Middle East.  USAMMCE has requirements world wide.  Stateside activit ies are veterinary clinics.  Army Regulation 40-905 Veterinary Health Services confirms the Army Veterinary Services as the Executive Agent for DoD and the Director, DoD Veterinary Services Activity, has directed that Hills Pet Nutrition Science® product as the standard diet for Military Working Dogs (MWD).  However, the Veterinary Service also uses and prefers the Prescription Diet.  Hill Pet Foods Prescription® Diet products are only sold through Veterinarians and the Science® Diet product line is sold through discriminating retail vendors.  Hill has no wholesaler for the entire Hills Pet Nutrition product line and no one company other than Hills Pet Food could provide the entire product line.  In addition, the DoD Veterinary Service has determined t hat all Military Working Dogs will be fed a standard commercial diet consisting of Science Diet Active Maintenance Formula, however, this is only one product of 153 products desired by the Army veterinarians.  Special diets other than the above diet may be  fed to individual Military Working Dogs (MWD) only if prescribed by the attending Army veterinarian on a case-by-case basis.  The DoD Veterinary Services has also indicated that the preferred pet food for the DoD Veterinary Clinics is Hill's Pet Foods Sci ence and Prescription Diet since they provide an entire line of nutritional products that cater to the routine as well as special needs for canines and felines.  Further, it is desirable to procure directly from Hills Pet Food since they also monitor the q uality control on their products and warranty their product.  This IDIQ contract will be used to provide a procurement instrument for use by USAMMCE and other activities of the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command, however, demand data provided in this synopsis only reflects requirements from USAMMCE.  The Government intends to issue an IDIQ contract for Science Diet and Prescription Diet food products to Hills Pet Foods, the only known authorized source for these products.  The contract shall co nsist of one Base Year and four One Year Option Periods.  CLIN 0001 BASE YEAR - 0001AA Canine Products & Feline Products; 0001AB Shipping Charges.  CLIN 0002 Option Year 1; CLIN 003 Option Year 2; CLIN 0003 Option Year 3 and CLIN 0005 Option Year 4, all co nsists of the same SUB-CLINS as in CLIN 0001.  All products are identified on Enclosure A which lists all products and also indicates annual estimated quantities of each product.  Annual estimated expenditures are approximately $200,000.00.  The list at En closure A shall be the basis for the quote on this solicitation.  Contractors shall provide firm fixed-price for each product number identified on Enclosure A for the base year and each option year of the contract.  The Government reserves the right to add  new products from Hills Pet Foods as required.  The IDIQ contract will be awarded based on best value, considering (1) Technical Acceptability  ability to pr ovide entire product line and ensure any product from the entire product line is available so that orders can be shipped and received within 30 days ARA; (2) Past Performance  demonstrated history of providing Hill's Pet Food products; and (3) Price.

Enclosure A - Contact the Contract Specialist of Contracting Officer Enclosure B - Justification and Approval for Prescription® and Science® Diet Feline/Canine Pet Food; Estimated $1,080,000.00 / 5 YEARS ($216,000/YEAR) 1. Contracting Activity: This requirement is for the United States Army Medical Material Center Europe (USAMMCE), Germany and the United States Army Medical Research and Material Command (USAMRMC), Fort Detrick, Maryland. The contracting office is the Uni ted States Army Medical Research Acquisition Agency (USAMRAA), 820 Chandler Street, Fort Detrick, MD 21702. 2. Description of Action: This will be an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity award for Prescription® and Science® Diet. The estimated value of this award is $1,080,000.00 over five years.  However the contract amount shall not exceed $4,999,000.00 ov er the five years. 3. Description of Supplies/Services: This award is for various types of canine and feline veterinary foods. These products are used in the Iraqi and Afghanistan theaters as well as the European Command.  The DOD Tri-Service Veterinary Group supports Veteri nary Clinics in the European Theater as well as Military Working Dogs, of which, the Department of Army is the Executive Agent. USAMMCE supports both missions and requirements.  4. Authority Cited: FAR Part 6.302-1 (b) (2) Only One Responsible Source due to existence of limited rights in data, patent rights, copyrights for Prescription ® and Science® Diet Pet Food manufactured by Hills Pet Nutrition  5. Reason for Authority Cited:  Army Regulation 40-905 Veterinary Health Services confirms the Army Veterinary Services as the Executive Agent for DoD.  DoD Letter dated 24 May 2005 signed by Colonel Scott Severin, Director, DoD Veterinary Services Activit y, directing Hills Pet Nutrition Science® product as the standard diet for Military Working Dogs (MWD). However, the Veterinary Service also uses and prefers the Prescription Diet which demand data supports Furthermore, discussion between Hills Nutrition  representative, Joyce Schloetzer Waida, the Contracting Officer, and the Contract Specialist, revealed that Prescription® Diet products are only sold through Veterinarians and the Science® Diet product line is sold through discriminating retail vendors.  Retail pricing would be much higher than ordering directly from the manufacturer.  However, neither can provide the entire product line which includes the Prescription Diet and Science Diet products.  As per Hills representative, there is no wholesaler f or the entire Hills Pet Nutrition product line and no one company other than Hills Pet Food could provide the entire product line.  In addition, DoD has determined, all Military Working Dogs will be fed a standard commercial diet procurred through the Fe deral Supply System, however, this is only one product of 153 products desired by the Army Veterinarians. The standard diet is Hills Science® Diet Active Maintenance Formula. Special diets other than the above diet may be fed to individual MWDs only if p rescribed by the attending Army veterinarian on a case-by-case basis.  The Director DoD Veterinary Services has also indicated that the preferred pet food for the DoD Veterinary Clinics is Prescription Diet since they provide an entire line of nutritional products that cater to the routine as well as special needs for canines and felines.  Further, it is desirable to procure directly from Hills Pet Food since they also monitor the quality control on their products and warranty their product.  Product Qualit y is closely monitored by Hills Pet Food and coordianted with the FDA.  6. Efforts to Obtain Competition:  A Sources Sought was conducted on 8 20 December 2005. Although several possible vendors inquired of this action, discussions with the manufacturer, indicate that Hills s Pet Nutrition is the sole manufacturer for these products and no one distributor could provide the entire product line at a reasonable price. Further, Hills Pet Nutrition does not provide its products for resale through distributors. 7. Actions to Increase Competition: The needs of the Government dictate that these products be obtained through the manufacturer in order to be assured of the needs of the AMEDD. 8. Market Research: Market research indicates that Prescription® and Science® Diet products are only legitimately available through the manufacturer although several wholesalers and retailers can provide some of the products. 9. Interested Sources: Manufacturer and several vendors claiming to be able to provide these products.  10. Other Facts: This action will be synopsized as a sole source acquisition.  This acquisition is strictly to obtain canine and feline pet nutrition products for use in veterinary clinics and to support Military Working Dogs. It shall not be used to obtai n product for support Post exchanges or commissaries. Prescription® and Science® Diet canine and feline nutrition products are evaluated and selected by the Veterinary Tri-Service Product Review Board, as governed by Army Regulation 40-905. The Army is the  DOD Executive Lead Agent for Veterinary Services. 11. Technical Certification: Include the following statement: I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my kn owledge and belief. ORIGINAL SIGNED BY - Kevin Ridderhoff, CPT,MS, Chief, CASD, 19 Oct 2006. 12.
