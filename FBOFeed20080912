<DESC>ITEC4/Mission and Installation Contracting Command (MICC), on behalf of the Network Enterprise Technology Command/Enterprise Systems Technology Activity (NETCOM/ESTA), intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Microsoft Consulting Services (MCS).  The sole source acquisition will extend the current Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract Number W91QUZ-05-D-0006 for the period, September 30, 2008 to September 29, 2009.  The support services require that the contractor perform work on Microsoft software products.  This work will require access to source code which is proprietary to the Microsoft Corporation and which Microsoft does not make available to other firms.  MS Consulting Services (hereafter MS Consulting) is a division of Microsoft and is the only source for the needed support services.  Obtaining the necessary support directly from Microsoft through its Consulting Services unit is crucial to the effective implementation of this enterprise license agreement.  MCS is the only source that can provide the software support required by the U.S. Army because Microsoft owns and controls the source code and other technical data essential to perform work on the relevant Microsoft products.  As noted, Microsoft has not licensed or otherwise given access to its proprietary code and data to any resellers or other third party vendors, including GSA Federal Supply Schedule and Government Multiple Award Contract (MAC) contractors, or any entity other than MCS.  Microsoft consultants will provide world-class technical expertise, enterprise experience and project management skills during the envisioning, planning, developing, stabilization and implementation phases of this effort.  Direct use of the services of MS Consulting increases the likelihood of successful implementation of the overall Army Golden Master (AGM) goals and objectives.  Referenced Numbered Note 22, except interested vendors must respond no later than September 19, 2008 with capability statement.

<DESC>ELGS/PNK formally announces the intent to award a sole source task order FA8734-08-D-0006 Government & Retirement Benefits, Inc. (GRB), under GSA contract GS34F-0047S Schedule 70 for approximately $4 million; basic performance period and three 1 year options.  To meet mission requirements, the objective of this acquisition is for the lease of software for the Employee Benefits Information System (EBIS) licenses and maintenance support for the integrated Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) - Employee Benefits Information System (EBIS) IVRS-EBIS Consortium.  Support requires the continuation (renewal) of the current EBIS license and maintenance for 600,000 users and consists of the following: 1) License to use the EBIS product for each of the existing Consortium members; 2) Maintenance support to include: a) Software changes, additions, refinements, and enhancements developed by Government & Retirement Benefits, Inc. (GRB), excluding any products or sub-products sep! arately priced; b) Software functionality to interoperate with user's database (IVRS); c) Provide finds or solutions to known problems with the software; d) Notify users of all known programming problems; e) Provide users the ability to submit problem reports through an interactive website or by other means; and f) Provide maintenance of information and data displayed on the web pages.  Justification for this follow-on contract is FAR 6-302-1. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  These services are deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of an anticipated follow-on contract for the continued provision of highly specialized services. The software is a leased product and the data rights are solely owned and cannot be purchased. The period of time required to perform a source selection as well as the ramp-up time required for a new contractor to customize software to meet the requirements woul! d cause an unacceptable schedule delay and a substantial duplication of cost to the government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  The basic period of performance is approximately 3 months and 3 one year options. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all interested persons that identify to the contracting officer their intent and capabilities to satisfy the government's requirement with commercial services items and are received within 15 days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government.  A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract actions based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service or the manufacturer meets qualifications requirements at time of award, in accordance with FAR clause 52.! 209-1 or 52.209-2.  An ESC Ombudsman has been appointed to consider and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offers, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition.  Before consulting the ombudsman concerned parties should first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. In addition AFFARS 5352.201-9101, OMBUDSMAN, will be included in this acquisition's solicitation and contract.

<DESC>The U.S. Army War College located at Carlisle Barracks, PA  intends to issue a solicitation for a Video-on-Demand system for Collins Hall; a state-of-the-art center with leading-edge Visual Information Technology and services. CSL has an on-going requirement to provide video to support a variety of conferences and exercises. The Video-on-Demand will provide an added benefit for the Strategic Decision Making Exercise by allowing the user to find an excerpt out of news cast so that they may focus on that issue. The Video-on-Demand system will allow inline tagging of a newscast decreasing the amount of man hours that an individual would have to sit and do manual tagging. The recorder would only need to add more detailed if required to minimize material for the search engine. The impact would decrease the amount of time that users spend surfing through unrelated material to acquire what they need. The Video-on-Demand System also allows word documents and presentations to be stored with recorded briefings and broadcasts. This requirement is unrestricted and Subject to Availability of Funds, (SAF). Solicitation will be issued on 18 September 2008 with a due date of 26 September 2008. The due date listed herein for receipt of proposals is approximate and subject to change based on actual issuance date.Telephone request will not be honored. Email request must include contractor name and street mailing address. Email request can be sent to: james.johnson27@us.army.mil. Request can be faxed to (717) 245-3053.

For health, comfort, and compatibility reasons, the Bureau of Diplomatic Security plans to procure Aeron ergonomic chairs from any of several potential vendors.
DS has a continuing need to provide its employees with a functional, practical, and healthy working environment.  A critical part of that environment is comfortable seating, given that most employees spend hours sitting at their computers.  Aeron chairs have been successfully used in the Bureau of Diplomatic Security for several years.  The chairs have been very reliable and the staff are fully content with the equipment.  It is impossible to tell how many injuries have been prevented or mitigated by use of these chairs, but it is safe to say that the use of Aeron ergonomic chairs greatly reduces these risks.
Aeron chairs are used almost exclusively in the Diplomatic Security Headquarters building.  In addition to the health benefits, the purchase of Aeron chairs would not detract from the overall appearance of various offices in the building.<BR><BR>

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the procurement of ASP firearm (non-letha) training aids (ASP Red Guns).  The use of a brand name description is essential to DS requirements.  ASP Red Guns are realistic training replicas that are reinforced for the durability needed in a law enforcement/security training environment.  The distinctive red color of ASP Red Guns readily identifies them as "safe" to the public and personnel in the training environment.  Additionally, DS already fields ASP Red Guns in various offices and maintaining uniformity is essential to providing the necessary safe training environment.  As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor's unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the requirements and maintain the uniformity necessary for a safe training environment.  This brand name equipment is already in use by DS and maintaining uniformity is essential to providing the necessary safe training environment.  We request no substitutions for all items and that all 250 kits be exactly the same including the kit bag.<BR><BR>

For an offer to qualify as an offer based on a GSA schedule contract, the value of "open market" items included in the offer may not exceed the applicable micro-purchase threshold as defined in FAR 2.101.<BR><BR>The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Information Resource Management, Systems Integration Office (IRM/OPS/SIO).  This Justification and approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of IBM and CISCO equipment.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governments requirements, for Department of States continued support of the payroll/retirement systems, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. IRM/OPS/SIO has identified the required hardware [an IBM z9 Business Class (BC) Mainframe (2096-N02 processor model series), two (2) IBM DS6800 SANS, two (2) IBM SAN19B-R routers, and two (2) CISCO MDS 922i switch devices] as a key requirement for the Departments continued use/operation of its payroll and retirement software applications.  The equipment listed above is required to maintain the existing Department of States software applications, which is based on the IBM operating software that is needed in order to carry out these functions. The 41 USC 253(c) (1), and FAR 6.302-1 are cited at the statutory authority. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification. Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements as a key component of the Departments continued use/operation of its payroll and retirement systems, which must run on the IBM operating software that is needed in order to carry out these functions. The requirement will be competed as the IT community response to price requests on FedBid. IRM/OPS/SIO has identified the IBM z9 BC Mainframe, SANS array, SAN router, and Cisco equipment as key components of the Departments Enterprise Operations Center (EOC).  Equipment listed above is required for continued support/maintenance of the departments core business functions (payroll, retirement), based on compatibility with existing hardware, which has reached end-of-life and is no longer maintainable by the hardware vendor (IBM).  <BR><BR>

<DESC>The Purchase of 24, HP DL385 servers including peripherals, and 24 72GB Hard Drives has already been tested and certified and this acquisition will help continue the service deployment of ADAS.  The servers from Hewlett Packard have been chosen because they were the units most compatible with the program, and they have already been tested and deployed. Procuring units from another manufacturer would require significant re-engineering of the project software. The goal of the ADAS Re-Host Team is to deploy a consistent hardware platform throughout the field.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases.  The NIAIDs Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) has a requirement to provide and develop animal models in order to advance our understanding of infectious diseases as well as advance the development of therapeutics and vaccines for infectious diseases.

 
NIAIDs role in developing medical products to counter emerging, re-emerging and other infectious diseases, as well as agents of bioterrorism, is part of a larger national strategy, involving multiple governmental agencies.  As such, NIAID supports integrated efforts in basic and applied research, product development, and technology development based on national priorities for medical products. Since 2001, NIAID has established a comprehensive infrastructure with extensive resources that support all levels of biodefense research.  With this solid framework of research and product development resources for biodefense in place, NIAID is now transitioning this infrastructure to provide the flexibility required to meet the challenges of emerging, re-emerging and other infectious diseases in addition to biodefense.

The use of animal models helps advance our understanding of infectious diseases as well as the development of therapeutics and vaccines.  For example, animal models are used to evaluate product candidates; provide data in support of Investigational New Drug (IND) applications; guide the selection of human dose levels and the design of clinical studies/trials; and provide pivotal efficacy data for products to be licensed under FDAs Animal Efficacy Rule (21 CFR 314.610 and 601.91), when clinical trials are not ethical or feasible.  In addition, for emerging and rare diseases, understanding the disease in animals may provide relevant information when little can be learned directly from humans.  Therefore, DMID is committed to developing and providing animal models to benefit the research community and public health.

For the most part, animal model services are currently provided through multiple, specialized programs. DMID now seeks to adopt an integrated approach to the provision of services by creating unified, comprehensive, coordinated programs. This strategy is being employed to: advance science by promoting cross-fertilization across and within disciplines and approaches; serve the research community more conveniently; achieve efficient use of resources through economy of scale and avoidance of duplication; and provide the flexibility needed to respond to changing priorities. Accordingly, DMID is establishing the Animals Models of Infectious Diseases program, utilizing the Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract mechanism.  

Under IDIQ contracts, base contract awards are made to multiple offerors that successfully propose a general approach to the technical requirements of the solicitation, providing a guaranteed minimum award. Task orders for specific tasks requiring specialized expertise are solicited and funded within the program Contractor pool. DMID is replacing multiple pathogen or class specific solicitations with one broad IDIQ solicitation for multiple contracts to cover all areas of current and potential future interests.  Animal models currently covered by existing pathogen-specific contracts will not be re-competed separately upon completion; however, they could be awarded as task orders under this program, upon expiration of those contracts.  

DMID is also establishing the Microbiology and Infectious Diseases Biological Research Resources (MID-BRR) program, which will serve as a central repository for microbiology and infectious disease researchers. The Animal Models of Infectious Diseases program will ensure a supply for the MID-BRR of pathogens that must be grown in animals and reagents integral to research on these organisms.

The Technical Requirements will be assembled into the following sections:

o	General Statement of Work, which specifies the basic technical requirements for all contracts.
o	Part Statements of Work, which specify additional technical requirements for contracts awarded to support each of four specific Parts:

Part A  Small Animal Models
Part B  GLP Small Animal Models
Part C  Non-Human Primate Models (+/- GLP)
Part D  Nontraditional Animal Models (+/- GLP)

Offerors may propose in response to one or more Part(s) of their choosing, and are not expected to respond to all Parts.  Offerors are also not expected to be responsible for all pathogens of interest or within scope for these contracts.  Offerors responding to multiple Parts must provide separate Technical and Business Proposals for each Part.  Proposals for each Part will be reviewed independently.  

For the purposes of this contract:
&#61607;	Small animals (Parts A and B) are defined as traditional small laboratory animal species, such as mice, rats, guinea pigs, hamsters, ferrets, chinchillas, and rabbits. 
&#61607;	Non-human primates (Part C) include various species, such as macaques, including Chinese and Indian rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), cynomyologous macaques (Macaca fascicularis), and pig-tailed macaques (Macaca nemestrina), etc.  Excluded are baboons and chimpanzees.
&#61607;	Nontraditional animals (Part D) are defined as specialty laboratory animal species not covered in Small Animal or Non-Human Primate Models (Parts A  C), which may have requirements not met in typical biomedical laboratory animal facilities, such as armadillos, woodchucks, snails, other invertebrates, and goats, swine, horses, cattle, etc.
&#61607;	Products to be evaluated in these animal models are broadly defined to include vaccines and other prevention strategies (e.g. microbicides), therapeutics targeting the host or the pathogen, including immunotherapeutics, and diagnostics.   Products will be provided to the Contractor by the Project Officer or a third party after Project Officer approval. 
&#61607;	Pathogens of interest must be pathogens of human concern and not only of animal concern; however surrogate human pathogen/animal combinations may be used for diseases where human pathogens cannot be studied in animal models.    
&#61607;	Pathogens are defined as bacteria, viruses, parasites, fungi, toxins, and other agents such as prions, including NIAID Category A, B and C Priority Pathogens (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/topics/BiodefenseRelated/Biodefense/research/CatA.htm). 
&#61607;	Reagents are defined as biochemical, genomic, molecular, cellular, and immunologic materials integral to research on these pathogens.

The following factors will be considered when evaluating proposals:

Technical Capability: adequacy and appropriateness of the general technical approach to animal model studies, to include conduct of product efficacy studies, animal model development, and supportive measurements (immunological, pharmacological, clinical, pathological, etc.); technical approach to pathogen production and characterization, including overall understanding of the pathogen and its behavior in animal models.  In addition, capability to comply with Good Laboratory Practices (21 CFR Part 58) will be evaluated for Part B, Part C and Part D.

Personnel and Project Management: adequacy, appropriateness and relevance of expertise, experience, qualifications, and availability of the key professional and technical staff with a project of similar size, scope, and complexity; adequacy and appropriateness of proposed organization and staffing to ensure efficient planning, initiation, implementation, conduct, and completion of all activities, including plans for communication and sharing of research resources.  

Facilities, Equipment and other Resources: availability of adequate, accredited animal facilities, with biocontainment appropriate for the pathogens proposed; availability of equipment necessary for the proposed animal studies; and adequacy of institutional biosafety program.

It is anticipated that multiple cost reimbursement, completion type contracts will be awarded for a seven-year period of performance beginning on or about 
January 4, 2010.  

Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency.   This RFP will be available electronically on/about September 29, 2008, and may be accessed through FedBizOpps http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. See Government-Wide Numbered Note 26.

<DESC>This notice constitutes a DRAFT BAA as contemplated by FAR 6.102(d)(2).  This DRAFT BAA is listed at http://www.navair.navy.mil/doing business/open solicitations/  (Business Opportunities/Open Solicitations).  All unclassified associated documentation (Government Furnished Information, DD254, etc) will also be posted at the above website.
1.0  Introduction. The Program Executive Office for Tactical Aircraft Programs  (PEO(T))(PMA234) is releasing this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) to seek proposals for research support in developing innovative solutions at the system level that address the Next Generation Jammer requirements.  Concepts developed under this BAA may be considered in the development of the Next Generation Jammer (NGJ) system prototype.  The Navys desire is to develop an evolutionary NGJ system for implementation in the 2018 timeframe.  The proposed acquisition strategy follows an incremental approach, where the first increment emphasizes a Modular, Open System Approach (MOSA) to provide an enabling environment for affordable development & sustainment as well as effective interoperability and integration.  
2.0  Background.  The current jamming system used in the Fleet is the ALQ-99 Tactical Jamming System (TJS).  The ALQ-99 TJS pod system was designed in the late 1960s and fielded with the introduction of the EA-6B in 1971.  The Next Generation Jammer (NGJ) system is intended to replace the capability currently enabled by the ALQ-99 jamming pods, providing a significant enhancement to the EA-18Gs electronic attack capabilities at a reduced operations and sustainment cost.  First identified in the 2002 AEA System of Systems (SoS) Analysis of Alternatives (AoA), there is a compelling need, founded in both capability and sustainability to move beyond the ALQ-99.
3.0  Program Goals.  Through this BAA, PMA-234 is seeking industry engagement to develop innovative ways to perform tactical jamming within the context of current and future threats using the EA-18G and Joint Strike Fighter as target platforms.  From a system level perspective, the goal of this effort is to investigate effectiveness of alternative solutions for the NGJ system, select and define an optimal solution, define its subsystems, allocate requirements, identify any needed technology developments, and establish initial project planning documentation. The offeror is expected to identify, substantiate, and resolve requirements that have questionable utility or have unacceptable risk of not being satisfied. Proposed solutions must be substantiated by trade studies and analyses that demonstrate the potential of the NGJ system meet the following broad conditions and constraints:  
  Possess interoperability with U.S. Naval, joint and multi-national forces.  
  Be compatible with size, weight, and power constraints of the EA-18G in the Mod-escort/Stand-off mission profile.
  Employ designs based on a modular open systems approach (MOSA) that incorporate appropriate considerations for re-configurability, portability, maintainability, technology insertion, vendor independence, reusability, scalability, interoperability, upgradeability, and long-term supportability. 
  Be fully interoperable with a wide-variety of battle management command and control systems.  
  Achieve an optimum balance of mission effectiveness, operational availability (reliability, maintainability, supportability, manning, and human system integration) and life cycle cost.
4.0  BAA Tasks.  There are four tasks associated with this BAA.  The first task (Mission Analysis) establishes tactical jamming system performance metrics and explores the capabilities necessary for optimally performing the jamming mission as part of the electronic warfare environment.  The second task (System Architecture) defines the NGJ conceptual system architecture and reports on Technology Effectiveness/Trade-off Analysis.  The third task (Technical Baseline) transforms the capabilities and conceptual system architecture into a NGJ system and creates a proposed technical baseline.  The fourth task (Project Planning Documentation) develops a plan that defines a program schedule, cost, human resource requirements and major material procurements for each phase of the conceptual hardware and software design & development, integration and test phases, and develops a risk assessment in realizing the proposed technical baseline within the intended timeframe.  Relative to each task, offerors will identify any overlap with other Department of Defense jamming Electronic Warfare (EW)/AEA development efforts, and state in the proposal what tasks have already been accomplished and any related constraints and resources. 
5.0  Contracts. It is anticipated that contracts awarded under this BAA will be restricted to businesses that have the in-house breadth of experience and expertise to explore in detail the specific areas of interest for which the offerors are proposing.  Offerors may also propose a teaming arrangement, in which the offeror will be responsible for the overall content of deliverables as proposed in the statement of work.  Furthermore, the Navy prefers that offerors possess the large scale integration experience necessary to comply with task 4.3 and 4.4 (see paragraph 6.6.3).  Due to the nature of the requirements, it is anticipated that there will be a series of government/contractor technical coordination meetings (TCM) throughout the period of performance for which the offeror should plan in the proposal.  The government expects to allot $4.0-$6.0M for each award.  However, award amounts and number of awards may vary based on budgetary constraints, technical merit and utility to the government.  The government is not required to award any contracts as a result of this announcement.     
5.1   Number of Awards.  It is the Governments intention to award up to six basic contracts under this BAA, however, the number of contracts may vary based on technical merit and utility to the government.  A single offeror submitting proposals for alternative approaches may receive multiple awards, at the Governments discretion.  The Government will consider each proposal independently and weigh each against the defined evaluation criteria. 
5.2  Period of Performance   The expected period of performance for contract award under this BAA is not to exceed six months from award date.  
5.3  Contract Type.  Contracts will be Firm Fixed Price.
5.4  Security Classification.  The DD-254 is for solicitation bidding purposes only, and is not valid for the actual contract.  Upon award of any contracts, new DD-254s will be established reflecting specific contractor requirements based on their proposal security classification requirements.
6.0  International Participation.  Foreign Nationals/Governments/Non-US Citizens (US government classification control) may not participate in this potential ACAT 1D program.
7.0  Offerors are advised that the employees of commercial firms under contract to the Government may serve as technical advisors on the program.  Such commercial firms are expressly prohibited from competing on the subject effort and from proposal rating, ranking, or recommending the selection of a source.  By submission of its offer, the offeror gives the Government permission to release the offerors proprietary information to employees of the following organizations:  John Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU-APL), Laurel, MD; and L-3 Services Inc. (Command & Control Systems and Software Division) of Lexington Park, MD.  
Questions regarding this solicitation should be addressed via email to Carolyn A. Abney, Contract Specialist, at carolyn.abney@navy.mil.  Telephone inquiries will not be accepted.  Emails MUST contain in the subject line:  Q&A for BAA N00019-08-R-0101, Next Generation Jammer. Amendments to the solicitation, if any, as well as questions and answers (Q&A) will be posted on the website at the above link.  Potential Offerors are strongly advised to periodically revisit the solicitation weblink for updates.

DFAR 252.204 7004, Alternate A, Required Central Contractor Registration (CCR), applies to this acquisition; therefore FAR clause 52.212 3 paragraph (b), relating to TIN number, does not apply.  DFARS 252.225 7000, Buy American Act - Balance of Payments Program Certi! ficate, applies.  Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror/quoter ineligible for award of an order.  Please ensure compliance with this regulation when submitting your quote.  Utilize the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov and/or call the CCR Assistance Center at 1-888-227-2423 for more information.  
FAR Clause 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items is applicable to this procurement.  
EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999)(a) The government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:
(1)	Management Plan and Staffing(2)	Past Performance(3)	Price
(b) Only those offers which are determined by the Contracting Officer to have adequate management and staffing plans for performing under Factor (1), MANAGEMENT PLAN AND STAFFING will be further evaluated under Factors (2) and (3).  In the second step of evaluating those offers determined under Factor (1) to be acceptable, Factor (2), PAST PERFORMANCE, is significantly more important than Factor (3), PRICE.  
Management Plan and Staffing represents MINIMUM acceptable criteria.  Under this factor, offers will be determined to be either acceptable or unacceptable.  Failure to be determined technically acceptable under this factor will render the offer to be unacceptable and not be considered for award. 
The Management Plan and Staffing should indicate not only the organizational element of the offeror but also the technical ability of the staffing that would be assigned to the proposed work.  It is expected that offerors' indicate experience of staffing plan by having worked with institutions of higher education.   Specific experience in demand-based scheduling is essential.   
Offerors should explain in detail how their proposal meets the requirements of paragraph 5.0 of the Statement of Work, addressing each task, function, and feature listed, i.e., G.1 through G.16, U.1 through U.12, S.1 through S.29 (Scheduling Features), S.1 through S.5 (Support Features), and A.1 through A.7.
(c) Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE information will be used to make a determination of whether the offeror has a satisfactory record of past performance.  Offerors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years using the attached Past Performance Data Sheet.
Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources that may have relevant information. 
Offers which lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  Any Offeror's proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors.
The contractor will be evaluated on PAST PERFORMANCE as follows:
NEUTRAL:  No relevant past performance available for evaluation.  Offeror has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience.  Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor.
OUTSTANDING:   No risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of any degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon offeror's past performance.
SATISFACTORY:  Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the offeror's past performance.
MARGINAL:  Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the offeror's past performance.
(d)  Offeror's PRICE will be the final discriminate in the evaluation.  Should Factors (1) and (2) be equal between/amongst competing offerors, the offeror with the low price would prevail.
(e) At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offeror's best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.   
(f)  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.



All quotes shall include price(s), a point of contact, name and phone number, business size, and payment terms. Please show a clear breakdown of all quoted costs.  Offerors may propose alternative travel schedules other than that described in the Statement of Work.  Each response must clearly indicate the capability of the quoter to meet all requirements.

The full text of the clauses/provisions from the FAR and DFARS can be accessed via the Internet using the following website addresses - www.arnet.gov/far/ and http://farsite.hill.af.mil/vfdfarspdf.htm.  It is the responsibility of the offerors to obtain copies of the necessary provisions and or clauses that are required as a part of this solicitation.  Required clauses/provisions that are not submitted may render an offer not to be accepted by the Government. 
FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items (NOV 2007).  NOTE: This provision must be reviewed completely. It contains the guidelines for submission of your quotation.
FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items (JAN 1999).  The Government intends to make one Firm Fixed Price Requirements contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.
The following factors shall be used to evaluate the quotation:
Factor (1) Technical Capability.   To be determined technically acceptable, the contractor must furnish information, e.g.: descriptive literature that provides sufficient technical information for the products being offered to be evaluated by the Government. 
Data must be submitted in accordance with FAR 52.212-1(b)(4). Provide information in an electronic (pdf preferred) if possible.  
Contractors meeting Factor (1) will have their quotation further evaluated under Factors (2) and (3).
Factor (2) Past Performance.Contractors are required to provide Past Performance data on your companies' two most recently completed federal government contracts (Not to exceed (3) years since completion) for like or similar material and services required by this solicitation. If you do not have federal government contracts, list state, local or commercial contracts.  Provide contract number, date of contract, quantity, unit price, total cost and the name of government activity or commercial company, point of contact/phone number. This performance data will be used to evaluate your companies past performance in meeting contract cost/price, technical and delivery objectives. Information should be provided on the Past Performance Data Sheet.  Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources who many have relevant information. 
Offers which lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor. Any offeror's proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors.
NEUTRAL: No relevant past performance available for evaluation. Offeror has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience. Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor.
OUTSTANDING: No risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of any degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the offeror's past performance.
SATISFACTORY: Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the offeror's past performance.
MARGINAL: Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the offeror's past performance. 
Factor (3) Pricing.Contractors must provide a current unit pricing for all CLINs specified for the Base Year and all option years and a total cost for the Base Year and option years quoted.  The unit price shall remain constant throughout the base year and any subsequent option year (price may change year-to-year). Only those offers which are determined by the Contracting Officer to have an acceptable Factor (1), TECHNICAL CAPABILITY, will be further evaluated under Factors (2) and (3).  In the second step of evaluating those offers determined under Factor (1) to be acceptable, Factor (2), PAST PERFORMANCE, is considered more important than Factor (3), PRICE.  Offeror's PRICE will be the final discriminate in the   evaluation.  Should Factors (1) and (2) be equal between/amongst competing offerors, the offeror with low price will prevail.
Quotations which take exception and do not meet the government's requirement may be determined to be unacceptable and not considered for award. At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the government intends to evaluate quotations without discussions and award a Firm Fixed-Price contract. Each initial offer should contain the contractors best terms from technical, delivery and pricing standpoint.

This part requires engineering source approval by the design controlactivity in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique designcapability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualifiedsource(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). Theapproved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technicaldata that are not economically available to the Government, and the data orknowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternatesource must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures,as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualificationprocedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity havingjurisdiction over the part in the intended application.The subject item requiresGovernment source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flightcritical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate tosupport acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source(s) previouslyapproved by the government for this item have been solicited. The time requiredfor approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayedpending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you mustsubmit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in the"https://www.neco.navy.mil/sar.cfm" Naval Inventory Control Point PhiladelphiaSource Approval Information Brochure. This brochure identifies technical datarequired to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of thesame or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. If your requestfor source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVICP-P, submit with youroffer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for sourceapproval. Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the SourceApproval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by theSource Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under thissolicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submittedhereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude theability to obtain subject items in time to meet government requirements, awardof the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

It also includes the development of a recommended training program for Logistics Engineering.<BR><BR>Logistics Engineering is the engineering discipline that addresses that portion of logistics requiring the mathematical, analytical and system design disciplines usually assigned to an engineer.  A logistics engineer should be able to perform an analysis of alternatives based on quantitative and qualitative analysis and must understand operational concepts and doctrine in order to be able to provide logistical assessments based on system and organizational design.  <BR><BR>Logistics Engineering sets the stage for the life cycle sustainment cost of the Army Aviation and Missile weapon systems.  The discipline ensures that operational requirements are established into a product baseline that will achieve life cycle logistics and supportability requirements for our systems.  Each of the components and sub-components of a weapon system require a systems engineering effort in support of establishing the product baseline to achieve logistics performance parameters related to reliability, repair time, inspection simplification, maintenance approaches, diagnostics, spare and repair parts, and maintainability.  The key logistics parameters associated with performance in the field requires application of engineering analysis and design.   The Logistics Engineer ensures that supportability is co-equal with cost, schedule, and performance.  <BR><BR>The Aviation and Missile Life Cycle Management Command (LCMC) is in critical need of Logistics Engineering expertise.   Through reorganizations and attrition, this expertise has diminished over the years.  The Engineering Directorate is developing the mission of providing logistics engineers in support of the LCMC.  <BR><BR>POC is Barry Howard, AMSAM-AC-RD-RED, Redstone Arsenal, AL  35898, email: barry.james.howard@us.army.mil<BR><BR>

<DESC>This is a pre-solicitation notice for Solicitation W52P1J-08-R-0070.  Estimated issue date is 30 September 2008 and estimated closing date is 28 November 2008.  The solicitation will be open for full & open competition, and proposals will be requested for a 40mm L60 High Explosive Incendiary (HEI) Cartridge to meet U.S. Government form, fit, and function requirements for the PGU-9C/B 40mm HEI Cartridge.  The 40mm L60 HEI program is an approved Foreign Comparative Test (FCT) program, and as such appropriate funds have been identified to support testing of foreign defense items/technologies produced by allied and other friendly countries.  It is noted that there are currently no funds available for qualification testing of U.S. technologies.  Procured 40mm HEI test cartridges will undergo US Government qualification testing for evaluation.  Proposals will be evaluated using best value procedures, and will result in the award of up to four (4) five-year, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contracts.  A minimum test quantity will be awarded with the basic contract(s), and production requirements will be competed among contractors with a US Government qualified 40mm L60 cartridge.<BR><BR>Performance requirements for the 40mm cartridge will be provided in the solicitation via a Statement of Work and Technical Description.  The required components of a proposed 40mm L60 HEI cartridge include a brass cartridge case, brass primer (with flashtube assembly if applicable), un-traced projectile, and a non self-destruct fuze, which is compliant with MIL-STD-1316, functions in a point detonating manner, and has a minimum safe arming distance of 140 feet.  The proposed 40mm cartridge shall be safe to fire from an AC-130 Gunship equipped with 40mm M2A1 Cannon without modification.  The performance requirements include Function and Casualty, Drift Dispersion, Range Dispersion, Projectile Function, Velocity, Projectile Extraction, and Dimensions.  Function and Casualty testing for First Article and Lot Acceptance testing shall be performed using the 40mm M2A1 Gun.  If a 40mm M2A1 Gun is not available, and a proposed 40mm gun system can be shown to be equivalent to firing from the 40mm M2A1 gun system, then the Government may approve that gun system for testing.  <BR><BR>Production for 40mm cartridges is very complex and required sophisticated industrial capabilities.  Skills required to produce these cartridges include:  ammunition process/design engineers; set-up mechanics and operators familiar with the programming and operation of ammunition component sub-assembly production equipment and LAP production equipment identified above; toolmakers and machinists to support all production facilities/equipment; certified inspectors, quality control engineers, ultrasonic technicians, metallurgists, and ballistics test personnel for in-process testing and final inspection, pack-out, First Article Test (FAT) and Lot Acceptance Test (LAT) ballistics testing, and shipment of ammunition products.  These critical skills require an extended period of time to acquire the job knowledge needed to manufacture and provide high quality ammunition in a timely manner.  Delivery of the minimum test quantity will be required within 12 months after award.  A producer must be able to complete a First Article Test within 180 days after award of any production requirement, with deliveries required to begin 240 days after award of a production requirement.  <BR><BR>The Point of Contact is Ms. Rachel Phelps, phone (309) 782-0281, email: rachel.phelps@us.army.mil.  <BR>

Coal Mining Component of the Proposed Fon Yaghnob Coal-Fired Power Plant.

The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a Feasibility Study to determine the availability and mine-mouth cost of coal supplies at Fon Yaghnob, as well as the most efficient method of mining these deposits.  The Feasibility Study will also help to determine the economic viability of constructing a coal-fired power plant at or near Fon Yaghnob.
  
To offset seasonal drops in the production of hydroelectricity, the Government of Tajikistan (GOT) has identified the expansion of coal-based electric power as a top priority.  The development of Tajikistans coal resources will help to promote long-term economic growth by allowing Tajikistan to generate enough electricity to both fully satisfy year-round domestic demand and to export surplus electricity to energy deficient markets in South Asia.  In particular, the GOT has decided to construct a 1500 MW coal-fired power plant at or near the Fon Yaghnob coal fields.  The Feasibility Study will determine whether the coal deposits at Fon Yaghnob are of sufficient quantity and minability to warrant the construction of such a power plant.

With proven and forecast reserves totaling more than 900 million tons, the Fon Yaghnob coal mine, located along the Zeravshan River in the Ayni District of the northern Soghd Region, is thought to be the largest coal deposit in Tajikistan.  However, large scale mining of coal deposits at Fon Yaghnob will be difficult due to the remoteness of the site, the mountainous nature of the terrain, and the inclination of the coal seams (greater than 45 slope in some places).  A lack of flat land, smoke stack issues (i.e. keeping out inversion), and a lack of roadways and other supporting infrastructure will also make it difficult to locate a power plant nearby, and may require that the coal be transported as far as 150 KM to a suitable site.  Coal supplies of approximately 4.34 million tons per year would be required to generate 1500 MW of electricity.  Current production at Fon Yaghnob is about 25,000-30,000 tons per year.

The Terms of Reference for this Feasibility Study includes:

Task A  Revise Proposed Draft Work Plan;
Task B  Review and evaluate available data and information concerning Fon Yaghnob coal reserves and current mining operations;
Task C  Investigate coal mining operations elsewhere that are comparable to the conditions at Fon Yaghnob;
Task D  Develop a concept for mining the Fon Yaghnob reserves at an output level required to supply a power generation plant with a capacity of 1500 MW;
Task E  Develop the mining plan, capital requirements, and mine-mouth coal production costs for the supply of coal to the power generation plant;
Task F  Preliminary Environmental Impact Assessment;
Task G  Development Impact Assessment; and
Task H  Final Report.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from an $875,378 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:

<DESC>The VISN 19 Rocky Mountain Network Contracting Center intends to negotiate sole source with Cardiovascular systems Inc., 651 Campus Drive, St. Paul, MN 55112, to provide Orbital Atherectomy Diamondback 260 Catheters System to the Eastern Colorado Health Care System, 1055 Clermont Street, Denver, CO 80220.  The Orbital Atherectomy Diamondback 360 System is used to ablate heavily calcified plaque in the peripheral blood vessels and because of the larger caliber vessels in the periphery, is a unique system designed to meet this need.  The system provides for removal of plaque while minimizing the potential for stress of injury to the media layer, and reducing the risk of barotraumas.  Through use of centrifugal force the system minimizes procedure time and expense of catheter upsizing.  The procurement will consist of the (1) 1.25mm Classic Crown, (2 ea); (2) 1.50mm Solid Crown, (2 ea); (3) 1.75 Solid Crown, (2 ea); (4) 2.00mm Solid Crown, (2 ea); (5) 2.25mm Solid Crown, (2 ea); (6) OAD Controller, (1 ea); (7) Replacement tubing pack, (1 pk); (8) Fire wire 5//bx; (1 bx); and (9) Flexible Wire 5/bx, (1 bx).  The Orbital Atherectomy System is very distinct from other systems in that this system allows treatment for the entire range of plaque in the peripheral vasculature.  Interested offerors may identify their interest and capability to meet the requirements by providing a capability statement and qualification which must contain specific information on supplying this type of equipment.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all capability statements received within 5 calendar days after the date of submission of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.

The current 4 ft antenna is efficient for only close-in sorties, such as ground checks, and does not have the gain required to track student curriculum sorties. TPS is also requesting an additional pedestal I/F PCB for azimuth and elevation, motor encoder, NEMA 23 servo amplifier assembly, QS, and a dual output 115/230VAV power supply to serve as spares. The parts were deemed mission critical if they were to fail due to everyday usage.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The upgrade would only need to replace the 4 ft reflector with a 6ft, pedestal base and install a camera subsystem so the pre-existing scan feed, ACU and PIU can be used. The new 6 ft reflector and pedestal base must integrate with the pre-existing scan feed, ACU and PIU. The new reflector must meet the following specifications:</p>
<p>&middot; 6 ft diameter reflector</p>
<p>&middot; Velocity minimum of 30 deg/sec</p>
<p>&middot; Backlash of 0.05 deg RMS</p>
<p>&middot; Greater than 29 dB gain @ 2400 MHz</p>
<p>&middot; AZ total travel continuous or &plusmn;410 deg</p>
<p>&middot; EL total travel of -5 deg to 185 deg</p>
<p>&middot; Operating temp range of -25 deg C to 55 deg C</p>
<p>&middot; Pedestal weight less than 120 lb</p>
<p>&middot; Wind speed operating 55 mph</p>
<p>&middot; Reflector and pedestal base must integrate with the current TPS PIU, conical scan feed and ACU designed by TCS, Inc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TPS also requires a compact color CCD camera with sun shield and camera system to include monitor, video interface cables and mounting adapters in order to visually track takeoff and landing to prevent data loss due to TM dropouts. A Camera tracking systems are standard on all Range antenna assets and critical for mission data quality. The camera must have a &frac12;", .75mm, F1.8 on chip Microlens with auto iris, 32x zoom and no need for a control panel. The necessary power will be supplied from the pedestal and the video will be brought out via the slip ring assembly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This system cannot be duplicated since TCS owns the proprietary design package and documentation on the current ACU and PIU.</p>

Guidelines

Guidelines consist of USG and Department of State Acquisition Regulations, and accepted engineering and architectural principles and theories.  In addition, incumbent must be able to determine application of basic administrative policy statements concerning the issue or problem being studied, and may include reference to pertinent legislative history, related court decisions, state and local laws, or policy initiatives of agency management.  The incumbent must also consider and adhere to various other existing federal regulations, and the interaction between DOS policies, legislation, the Foreign Assistance Act, and other authorization and appropriations in the INL account, applicable National Security and Presidential Decision Directives, OMB Circulars, and DOS financial operating procedures and policies.  The incumbent is recognized as a substantive authority on overall management and/or interpretation of guidance on program and project planning and evaluation in a specialized area.

Complexity

Develops detailed plans, goals, and objectives for the long-range implementation and administration of the program, and/or develops criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of the program.  Decisions concerning planning and organizing the project are complicated by the intricacy of the contract and the need to deal with multilayered concepts.  Additionally, the Project Coordinator is operating in an environment, frequently at post, where he/she must be able to make on-the-spot decisions involving large amounts of money and having strategic and/or geopolitical ramifications without consultation with senior management.

Projects require dynamic leadership and expertise and complex innovation, strict adherence to high level policy without lower level interpretive assistance, and the ability to single-handedly or in concert with a variety of other stakeholders resolve critical problems and achieve difficult goals that may impact on other programs.  They are broad in scope and complicated by many complex features, technical, administrative, or political in nature.  

Physical Demands

Domestically, the work is principally sedentary.  While on a site visit, or temporarily detailed to, overseas, there are physical demands associated with travel to and from remote areas abroad in restrained time frames over underdeveloped infrastructure and conveyances  the position requires an above average resistance to fatigue and physical hardships is required.  Extended onsite visits to remote construction and/or project sites will occasionally be required, necessitating the ability to walk medium to longer distances (hundreds of yards or more) on generally irregular dirt or stone surfaces, in both hilly and flat terrain.  Those who use wheelchairs, have respiratory difficulties, or require assistance walking will find this difficult.  Additionally, those undergoing medical treatment or taking certain medicines that limit their physical or mental abilities may find it difficult to adhere to the limitations recommended by their physician(s).  Travel on helicopters and/or cargo-oriented fixed wing aircraft will also be required.  Those with ear or other problems, who do not easily adapt to pressurized environments or higher but non-pressurized environments, will find the travel requirements of these positions difficult.  Climate conditions are also often a factor.  Work is often done in extremes of cold and heat, in dusty and windy environments, and frequently outdoors.  Those with circulation problems or difficulties adapting to climate extremes or extremely dusty environments will find this aspect of the position difficult.

II.  Minimum Qualifications

	U.S. citizen, eligible for a Top Secret State Department security clearance.
	Extensive experience in the engineering or project management field, including mastery of concepts, principles, laws and regulations associated with the broad areas of international relations, particularly as it relates to the development and implementation of post conflict and emerging development programs.  One year of this experience must be equivalent to the GS-13 level in the federal service. A Bachelor's Degree from an accredited institution in a field related to business or engineering is desired.
	Understanding of architecture and engineering principles sufficient to be able to investigate and provide information and guidance on the range of systems, processes, and components inherent in the design and construction of new buildings, training facilities and related structures.

<DESC><p><strong>GSA Federal Acquisition Services </strong>
<p><strong>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION/RELO INDUSTRY FORUM<br />Travel and Transportation Acquisition Support Division<br />General Services Administration<br />Employee Relocation Services<br />September 23, 2008</strong></p>
<p><br /><strong>GENERAL INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.0 OBJECTIVE</strong><br />On September 23, 2008, the General Services Administration (GSA) will host an industry information session to conduct market research to refine a proposed new guaranteed home sale services model. The purpose of the information session is to solicit feedback from industry on the proposed model, stakeholder requirements, and other pertinent issues to assess viability of the model and its requirements.<br /><br /><strong>2.0 PROBLEM STATEMENT</strong><br />Federal civilian agencies relocate approximately 28,000 civilian employees annually. Approximately 12,000 of these employees receive guaranteed home buyout assistance as a relocation benefit to expedite the sale of their home, maximize the sale price, and access the home's equity. This is an important human capital benefit for recruitment and retention and, for some agencies, is a requirement to ensure personnel are mobile for mission-critical functions. Historically, 85% of guaranteed home buyout services were procured via GSA's Multiple Award Schedule, entitled Transportation, Delivery and Relocation Services Schedule (Schedule 48).<br />Under the terms of Schedule 48, Relocation Service Providers (RSPs) assume all burden and privilege of ownership of the relocating employee's home if the home does not sell within a specified period. For this service, RSPs charge fixed percentage rates based on the home's sale price.<br />Recent downturns in the housing and lending markets have significantly affected suppliers' ability to provide guaranteed home sale services to the Government under the Schedule because the model requires suppliers to bear all risks at fixed percentage rate pricing. Under commercial models, RSPs offer services under cost-reimbursable contracts and transferees' private-sector employers bear the risks of owning the homes. <br />GSA has assessed models based on commercial standards and best practices to develop a new guaranteed home buyout model to supplement home buyout services currently offered under Schedule 48. The objective of this new model is to task a service integrator with acquiring commercially priced guaranteed home buyout services that include full mortgage payoff that may be made available to the government at fixed percentage rate pricing. GSA wishes to acquire this capability through one commercial source which has contracts with the necessary range of suppliers and services, to accomplish the vision as described in the draft statement of objectives. The DRAFT sow may be obtained by e-mailing your request to: transportation.programs@gsa.gov and onthego@gsa.gov using the subject line RELO INDUSTRY DAY.</p>
<p><strong>3.0 DISCUSSION OF INTEGRATE HOME SALES SERVICES INITIATIVE</strong><br />Below are some the questions that GSA will address during the Industry Forum:</p>
<p>1. What is the vision of this guaranteed home sale contracting vehicle?<br />2. What is the impact on the existing GSA schedules?<br />3. What are the roles, responsibilities, and anticipated requirements for the various stakeholders who would participate in this service as conceived in under the proposed model?<br />4. Will there be unique technology-related or security-related requirements? <br />5. What is the tentative timeline for the procurement?</p>
<p><strong>4.0 INDUSTRY FORUM</strong></p>
<p>GSA is hosting an Industry Forum to refine its requirements for a proposed New Home Sale Services contract. GSA shall discuss preliminary information regarding the program initiative. The industry forum is scheduled as follows:</p>
<p>Tuesday, September 23, 2008<br />1:00 PM (ET) - 4:00 PM (ET)<br />Room L1301 <br />2200 Crystal Drive<br />Arlington, VA 22202</p>
<p>An industry forum may be used when the Government does not presently intend to award a contract, but wants to obtain price, delivery, other market information, or capabilities for planning purposes. This meeting does not obligate the government in any way to issue an RFQ for the services discussed.</p>
<p><strong>5.0 RESPONSES</strong></p>
<p>GSA requests feedback, comments, concerns, recommendations on the proposed guaranteed home buyout contracting vehicle. Respondents are encouraged to think broadly about how to best achieve the desired services.</p>
<p>Vendors are encouraged to mark each page believed to contain corporate sensitive information with the note "Proprietary Information". Responses should be based on the material contained in this announcement and any other relevant information the vendor thinks is appropriate.

<a href="mailto:Lois.E.McDuffee@nasa.gov">Lois E. McDuffee</EMAIL></a>
<DESC>NASAs Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) contract for Multi-DisciplinaryEngineering and Technology Services (METS) was established to provide engineering andrelated services with an emphasis in the areas of systems engineering, softwareengineering, information technology, and guidance navigation and control services toenable future science missions.The current METS contract is a cost-plus-award-fee, indefinite delivery, indefinitequantity (IDIQ) type with a current maximum contract ordering value of $250 million.  Itwas awarded competitively as an 8(a) set-aside.  Future projections and trends indicatethat the magnitude of potential work for the next 5 years could well exceed this currentvalue by almost double.  The intent of this RFI is to share with industry our currentplans and considerations, to solicit capability statements from qualified 8(a) companies,and to solicit comments from industry.GSFC has developed these plans to enhance competition among qualified 8(a) companies, tocreate contracts of a magnitude more amenable to performance and management by qualified8(a) companies, and to focus logically related engineering disciplines in separatecontracts.GSFC plans to compete and award 2 separate 8(a) contracts.  The first contract wouldinclude the  majority of the elements of the Mission Engineering & Systems AnalysisDivision, Code 590, including systems engineering and guidance navigation and controlservices.  It would also include a portion of the Instrument Systems & TechnologyDivision, Code 550; specifically those efforts that are currently incorporated in thecurrent METS contract.	This contract will be known as METS-II as the follow-on contractto METS and remain a multidisciplinary services contract for AETD that is administeredout of Code 590.The second contract would include the work of the Software Engineering Division, Code580, including flight and ground software developments, science processing, and missionground, flight and science system development/engineering.  This contract will be knownas the Software Engineering Support (SES) contract.There are specific functions, such as project management, that would still be required inboth planned contracts.  To assist industry in reviewing this division of work, we areproviding a work statement for each of these contracts with this RFI.  Note that the SESwork statement includes some flight software development and maintenance and missionoperations software engineering development currently obtained on a large businesscontract.  We will supplement the SES work statement with additional details as they aredeveloped.  Those supplements will be linked to this site as soon as they are available.GSFC currently expects to award both contracts as cost-plus-fixed-fee level-of-effort(LOE); however, we are soliciting industry feedback on the appropriateness of our choiceof contract type.  We are planning to issue 2 separate requests for proposals (RFPs),one each for the 2 distinct efforts, with separate Source Evaluation Boards.  Contractorscan, of course, propose on both RFPs.	GSFC anticipates nearly simultaneous release ofboth draft RFPs in November 2008, with a release of the METS-II RFP in January 2009 anda release of the SES RFP in February 2009.  Industry comments to the draft RFPs would bedue 2 weeks after draft RFP release.  We anticipate that both RFPs will requiresubmission of proposals within 45 days.  The anticipated award date for both contracts isNovember 1, 2009, after completion of 30-day phase-in purchase orders.	Note that GSFCwill separately acquire Flight Dynamics Support Services (FDSS) via a separate, ongoing,small-business set-aside competition.  FDSS consolidates work previously included underthe Multi-Mission Flight Software Support, the Mission Operations and Mission Services(MOMS), and the METS contracts.NASA/GSFC requests industry feedback related to the procurement strategyelements that are included in this RFI.Interested 8(a) organizations are requested to submit their capabilities andqualifications to perform the effort. Responses (30-page maximum including attachments)must include the following: name and address of firm, size of business; average annualrevenue for past 3 years and number of employees; ownership; 8(a) status (e. g., timeremaining in 8(a) program); number of years in business; affiliate information, if any:parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners, prime contractor (ifpotential sub) or subcontractors (if potential prime); list of customers covering thepast five years (highlight relevant work performed, contract numbers, contract type,dollar value of each procurement; and point of contact - address and phone number).Specific engineering examples of relevant experience, including detailed descriptions,are recommended. To facilitate a prompt review by the NASA team, a one-page summary shallbe included with your capability statement(s), which identifies your companys specificcapabilities that are relevant to the requirement. The summary page will not countagainst the maximum page limit. It is insufficient to provide only general brochures orgeneric information.  Industry feedback related to the procurement strategy set forth inthis RFI will be excluded from the 30-page limit for capability statements.We intend to release the names, addresses, and points of contact of all respondentsunless specifically requested not to do so by the respondent.  Questions should be directed, as follows, to: Multidisciplinary Engineering & Technology Services (METS II)Technical:  Mr. Tom McCarthy, 301-286-8496Procurement:   Ms. Lois McDuffee, 301-286-9083Software Engineering Support (SES)Technical:  Mr. John Donohue, 301-286-8623Procurement:  Ms. Maria McNamee, 301-286-4163This sources sought synopsis is for informational and planning purposes only and is notto be construed as a commitment by the Government; nor will the Government pay for anyinformation solicited. Since this is a sources sought announcement, no evaluation lettersand/or results will be issued to the respondents. You are requested to provide electronicresponses via e-mail to the Point of Contact (POC) listed at the end of this synopsisindicating which contract(s) you organization is interested in performing. Your responseis required by 1:00 p.m. local time on September 26, 2008. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If asolicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA AcquisitionInternet Service. It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor these sites forthe release of any solicitation or synopsis.The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note26.The NAICS Code and Size Standard for both procurements are 541712 and 1,000 employees.This notice hereby cancels RFI #NNG08250692L, the previous synopses on METS-II. Companies should submit new capabilities statements for these two new competitions asdetailed in the above paragraphs.

<CONTACT>Edward S. Ortiz, Phone 202-283-7489, Email Edward.S.Ortiz@irs.gov
<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) intends to award a sole source purchase order to Sonasoft Corporation, for the purchase of the software licenses related to Exchange Disaster Recovery capabilities. These items and services have been determined to meet the definition of commercial items in accordance with Part 2.101 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  

The IRS has a need for the following items:

CLIN 0001  Sonasafe Application, Item Number SC, Quantity 4

CLIN 0002  Exchange Standby License, Item Number SC-B, Quantity 4

CLIN 0003  Exchange Agent, Item Number SE, Quantity 8

CLIN 0004  Exchange Standby Agent, Item Number SE-S, Quantity 8

CLIN 0005  1 Year Sonasoft Software Maintenance, Item Number SM, Quantity 1.

The IRS requires the purchase of the above mentioned Sonasoft software since it will expand the IRS-Office of Chief Counsels (OCC) Exchange Disaster Recovery capabilities beyond the incumbent servers. The software initiates the real time replication of mail box changes and commences the backup of mailboxes via existing IRS servers. In addition, the software package includes the ability to rapidly switch to a disaster recovery site from a remote location. The software platform allows the OCC to recover customer e-mail in the event of a catastrophic Exchange server failure. Sonasoft Corporation has customized their commercial off the shelf software to operate within the OCC. Sonasoft is the sole proprietor of the software and software maintenance. 
 
Vendors who can provide the required services at prices, terms and conditions equal to or better than those which can be provided by Sonasoft Corporation, should submit clear and convincing data in writing substantiating an ability to furnish the entire requirement.  Telephonic or email inquiries will not be accepted.  Responses to this notice must be received by this office by 05:00 pm EDT on September 17, 2008.  Responses should be sent to:  Internal Revenue Service, Office of Procurement, 6009 Oxon Hill Road, Oxon Hill, MD 20745, Attn: Eddie Ortiz, OS:A:P:I:F:B.  Responses will be accepted by facsimile at (202)283-4427.  These responses may not exceed 10 pages. A formal solicitation may be issued if a response is received that meets IRS's requirements, and the analysis of both technical and pricing documentation indicate a competitive acquisition would be more advantageous to the Government.  Currently, no solicitation document exists for this requirement.  Requests for same will be considered non-responsive.  The reference number for this announcement is Y8Y184TSA62-000.  If no compelling responses are received, the award will be made to Sonasoft Corporation.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 13.106(b)(1), with 4PI Analysis Inc, for upgrade for a FEI Titan Stem, to include the following:


1 each:  Universal Spectral Engine w/digital pulse processor, integrated HV power supply, universal detector interface card, scan gen hardware configured with 2 video channels, 1 GB Ethernet card, and cables to interface to SEM's digital beam control and PC's Ethernet port.

1 each:  System software - 4pi Revolution. Quant/Imaging Package.
System computer - Dell OptiPlex 745 running XP Pro. Minimum specifications include 1.86GHz Intel Core 2 Duo processor, 1GB SDRAM, 160 GB hard drive, 256MB dual-monitor video card, CDRW/DVD combo, and 19" UltrSharp flat-panel display. 

1 job:   Installation 

Based on NISTs recent market research, NIST has only identified the one source that can provide the required request 4PI Analysis Inc.

Although other manufacturers of XEDS acquisition systems offer some form of "on the fly" spectral image acquisition, the functionality required to achieve the desired performance is available only with the RevolutionEDX integrated acquisition system (IAS) through 4pi Analysis, Inc.  The critical feature for the implementation of XEDS spectral imaging at atomic resolution is the real-time drift correction and registration of the XEDS data with the HAADF image at a high frame rate over multiple frames, since the drift of the specimen relative to the incident beam raster is severe at these high spatial resolutions.  The 4pi system is specifically designed to optimize this performance feature.  The 4pi RevolutionEDX IAS also has components and features which exceed the industry standards, e.g., 16-bit (cf 12-bit industry standard) digital-to-analog converters (DACs) for high beam positioning sensitivity and a large number of pixels (18k x 18k, cf 4k x 4k industry standard).  

The Government anticipates the award of a firm-fixed- price purchase order.  This notice of intent is not a request for quotations; however, companies that believe they can fulfill the requirement may provide a written response to this notice and provide clear and unambiguous evidence to substantiate that capability. A determination by the Government whether to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competition.

Description This is NOT a solicitation announcement. This is a Sources Sought Notice only. The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and their size classifications (Service Disabled Veteran-Owned, Veteran-Owned Small Business, Women-Owned Small Business, HubZone 8(a), 8(a), HubZone, Small Business, Emerging Small Business, Small Disadvantage Business (SDB), and Large Business) relative to NAICS code 541380 (size standard of $5.0M). Responses to this request for information synopsis will be used by the government to make appropriate Acquisition decisions. Responses to this sources sought notice shall NEITHER constitute responses to solicitation which is not currently available NOR a request to be added to a prospective bidders list to receive a copy of the solicitation. The decision to solicit for a contract shall be solely the Government's discretion. This sources sought notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information submitted in response. Respondents will not be notified of the results of any government assessments. No awards will be issued as a result of this solicitation announcement. However, the information received will be utilized to assist in formulating the strategy for competitive procurements. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, hereafter referred to as USEPA, is seeking information from potential contractors to provide multi-media, multi-concentration dioxin/furan analytical services.  The analytical data will be used  in support of the investigation and clean-up activities under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) and the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA). Other USEPA Program Offices, as well as customers outside the Agency, that have similar analytical data needs also use this service.
BackgroundThe dioxin/furan analytical service provides a contractual framework for laboratories to apply USEPA analytical methods for the isolation, detection, and quantitative measurement of 17 2,3,7,8-substituted tetra through octachlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (CDDs) and chlorinated dibenzofurans (CDFs) in water, soil, sediment, sludge, tissue (no human tissue), ash, oil, and oily matrices. The analytical service provides the methods to be used and the specific contractual requirements by which the Government will evaluate the data. This service uses a High Resolution Gas Chromatography/High Resolution Mass Spectrometry (HRGC/HRMS) method to analyze the target compounds.
This analytical service provides data used for a variety of purposes such as: determining the nature and extent of contamination at a hazardous waste site; assessing priorities for response based on risks to human health and the environment; determining appropriate clean-up actions; and determining when remedial actions are complete. The data may be used in all stages in the investigation of hazardous waste sites, including: site inspections; Hazard Ranking System (HRS) scoring; remedial investigation/feasibility studies; remedial design; treat ability studies; and removal actions. In addition, this service provides data that are available for use in Superfund enforcement/litigation activities. The Contractor must be aware of the importance of maintaining the integrity of the data generated under this contract, since it is used to make major decisions regarding public health and environmental welfare.
Sources interested in this notice shall submit the following information: 1. Company name, address, point of contact, cage code, size of business pursuant to NAICS. In addition interested parties shall submit responses to the following questions: (1) is your business a large or small business? (2) If small, does your firm qualify as a Small, Emergent Business, or a Small, Disadvantaged Business? (3) If disadvantaged, specify under which disadvantaged group and is your firm certified under section 8(a) of the small business act? (4) Is your firm a certified "Hub Zone" firm? (5) Is your firm a Woman-Owned or operated business? (6) Is your firm a certified Service-Disabled Veteran Owned and Veteran-Owned? Interested parties should also provide a list of references, capabilities and experience in conducting similar projects for the past 3 years. This is not a request for proposals or request for quotes and in no way obligates the government to award any contract. 
This notice is being used to obtain information for planning purposes and the Government does not presently intend to award a contract at this time. As stipulated in FAR 15.201, responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps (https://www.fbo.gov) and on the USEPA Acquisition Management site (http://www.epa.gov). It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of any synopsis or solicitation and amendments, if any. Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments, if any. 
Responses to this notice shall be submitted by e-mail addressed to Rodriguez.Evia@epa.gov. All responses must be received no later than 3:30 PM. Local time on September 26, 2008. Telephone responses will not be accepted. Firms responding to this announcement, which fail to provide all of the required information, cannot be used to help the government make the acquisition decisions, which is the intent of this synopsis. This notice is to help the USEPA in determining potential sources only. No solicitation is currently available. All firms responding to this request for information notice are advised that their response to this notice is not a request to be considered for a contract award.Set-aside code: N/APlace of performance:U.S. Environmental Protection Agency1200 Pennsylvania Avenue NWWashington, D.C. 20460USAContact: Evia Rodriguez, Contract Specialist, 202-564-0890

<SUBJECT>Intent to Single Source to Electronic Online Systems International
<SOLNBR>LASB-08-60

<DESC>The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) intends to solicit and negotiate on a sole source basis with Electronic Online Systems International (EOSI), under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.

In January 1995, NLRB searched cost-effective ways to convert librarys collection into a machine-readable format for the purpose of accessing this data electronically.  Data Trek, library automated system, was purchased to support reference, circulation, opac, and cataloging activities.  In 2000
Data Trek merged into EOS International and upgraded our Professional Series to GLAS (Graphical Library Automation System).  GLAS is a comprehensive library information system for small to mid-sized libraries.  
GLAS, the librarys current catalog software, is no longer being developed, and the hardware will not be supported.  The push is on to convert GLAS users to EOS.Web e-Library Service, a web-based fully hosted solution.  The rationale for upgrading/migrating from one system to another is for increased functionality of librarys information system for the benefit of end-user, and affordability.  Library Staff and NLRB users would access the system via the web, and which offers all the standard functions typical of a library automation solution.  The current promotion cost to migrate to the new EOS system is the same price as our current annual software maintenance and support fee to GLAS.
Software Modules Required
Vendor will provide a fully web-based hosted solution built upon Microsoft .NET technology platform.  Vendor must be a certified GOLD Microsoft Partner and offer a Citrix-free hosted environment.
Web OPAC 
Web OPAC will allow patrons and staff to place holds, search and explore library collections from remote locations via the internet, thereby saving patrons from having to plan a trip to the library.
Cataloging 
Cataloging will allow one to catalog from any location via your browser, complete with the functionality needed to add, view, delete or edit a record. Plus, library staff must have the capability to view records and conduct cross library searches similar to the public. Ideally, the system will provide a notes field, which enables you to digitally enhance existing bibliographic information with abstracts or links.  MARC editing functions should be included in the cataloging module. The MARC editor should provide MARC-labeled editing screens for importing, exporting, adding and maintaining bibliographic records, complete with the display of valid MARC codes. 
Circulation 
Circulation features should provide intuitive circulation desk functions designed to facilitate the viewing and editing of both patron and item information in a logical fashion, improving service to patrons. NLRB needs to easily check in/out multiple items with fewer clicks from the circulation desk in the library, or from a wireless bookmobile.
NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE. Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of satisfying NLRB's requirements may submit a written capabilities statement, which will be considered for furture requirements. A determination not to compete the requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC><p>This is a SPECIAL NOTICE to announce an INDUSTRY DAY <br />to be held on Friday, September 19, 2008 beginning at 8:00 am.
<p>The purpose of this event is to allow the Government an opportunity to provide a brief overview of an upcoming contract requirement, address specific questions relating to the attached Draft SOW and QASP, and to seek information that can be beneficial in planning the strategy for the recompete of the Individual Assistance/Technical Assistance Contracts IA-TAC.</p>
<p>This requirement is scheduled to be awarded in February 2009.</p>
<p>OVERVIEW</p>
<p>For this requirement, the IA-TAC Management Branch requires each Individual Assistance/Technical Assistance contractors to be capable of delivering a comprehensive set of construction, architectural, engineering, project management and program management services, in support of multiple disaster missions of any size relative to the awarded regional sector and to support if necessary their backup regional sector during a catastrophic event. The Individual Assistance Technical Assistance Contracts (IA-TACs) support FEMA's implementation of the agency's Emergency Support Function 6, Human Services (ESF-6) programs as authorized by the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act.</p>
<p>Our anticipate strategy, although not yet approved for this requirement, is to divide the scope of this requirement into four regional sectors. This strategy, if pursued will allow for the initial competition and subsequent award of four (4) separate contracts, not multiple award, to four different contractors to provide services in their awarded regional sector. This strategy prevents the needs for fair opportunity consideration among the awardees when task orders are issued. Such a strategy will facilitate a more streamlined approach to our acquisition process, thereby enhancing our ability to provide rapid responses to disasters and other emergencies. The anticipated contracts will be Performance Based with a Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan and Performance Requirements Summaries.</p>
<p>GENERAL SCOPE</p>
<p>By using such an approach for this requirement, FEMA personnel and contractor personnel will know at the time of a disaster; who and what company will be responsible for a specific regional sector. The concept further provides contractors a smaller zone of responsibility than was expected in previous contracts. The regional sector approach affords each responsible contractor to be more knowledgeable and therefore better equipped, to handle potential hazards that are unique to specific regional areas.</p>
<p>The size and scope of the contractor's task or mission may vary based on the regional sector, the, type of incident, its scale and magnitude of damage, and its potential or real impact on national security. The mission also will be measured by the projected number of displaced individuals and households, as well as the availability of resources (housing, personnel, supplies, and materials).</p>
<p>The contractors shall provide support for all types of hazards (man-made or natural), to include (but is not limited to) floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, typhoons, earthquakes, tsunamis, and Incidents of National Significance as defined or indicated by FEMA.</p>
<p>This support shall include, but will not be limited to, performing or supporting the following functions or tasks: (A) Direct Housing Missions; (B) Mass Care and Sheltering; (C) Establishing and running Disaster Recovery Centers; (D) Call Centers (E) General Construction; (F) Conducting pre and post-event Assessments; (G) Program Management, Planning and Analysis.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Industry Day is to provide the strategy and concepts / ideas that may appear in the upcoming solicitation. Through this forum, we are partnering with industry to seek feedback on how to become better prepared to meet our mission through more streamlined acquisition solutions.</p>
<p>THIS IS AN INDUSTRY DAY ANNOUNCEMENT for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals and there may be No contract awarded from this announcement. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests. FEMA is restricting attendance to the first fifty (50) companies to contact the POC below. Each company that is notified that its attendance request has been accepted can only send two representatives each. If space permits, this limitation scenario may change and will be posted on FEDBIZOPPS.</p>
<p>Specific questions regarding the attached draft SOW and QASP shall be submitted in writing to Ms. Zahra Hashmi at Zahra.hashmi@dhs.gov. Responses to these questions will be posted on FEDBIZOPPS and addressed during the industry day meeting. Additionally, during the meeting, each company will be allowed to ask up to three (3) questions per company.</p>

<DESC>The Multifunctional Materials Team, Warfighter Science, Technology and Research Directorate at the U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research, Development, and Engineering Center, Natick, MA has a need to identify possible solutions to integrate Flame Retardant (FR) and Chemical/Biological (CB) properties into a low-cost, lightweight, and comfortable material with enhanced breathability for use in protective hood applications. The government is conducting a market investigation seeking material information, manufacturing capabilities and/or samples of materials that can provide these integrated capabilities.  Nonwoven materials, nanotechnology, stretchable barrier materials, disposables, and other novel barrier technologies will be considered.  The government will perform all physical and other required testing to determine the best performing material / solution available.  Companies may request testing results regarding only their own materials.  Ideal materials would meet the following critical performance requirements:  (1) Flame Resistant less than 2 sec After flame, less than 25 sec Afterglow, less than 3.5 inches Char length, and no flaming melt/drip when tested in accordance with (IAW) ASTM D 4613-99, (2) Air Permeability greater than 10 cfm when tested IAW ASTM D737, (3) Weight less than 10 oz/sqyd when tested IAW ASTM D 3776, (4) Provide stretch and recovery characteristics with minimum degradation in CB protection performance, (5) be printable to conform to the current visual and IR spectral performance requirements for Woodland Camouflage, (6) Provide 12 hours of continuous protection from a liquid challenge of 5 g/m2 of the chemical agents HD, GD and VX, and a vapor challenge at 5000Ct for HD, TGD and VX, and a aerosol challenge at 5000Ct for HD, TGD, and VX.  In addition to the above performance, it is desired that the material have high drapeability, low noise generation (i.e. when worn), low stiffness, low thickness, a low cost per unit area, and a high Moisture Vapor Transfer Rate.  The requirements listed above indicate a desired performance level and are not intended to eliminate a single technology or material from submission or evaluation.  Information should include, but not limited to, product cost, technical information (e.g. physical properties, performance characteristics, test methodology (e.g. ASTM, AATCC, NFPA 701)), available test results for flame resistance and CB protection, certification/compliance, relevant company background/experience, and any other information that the company believes demonstrates the value of their product(s) and the ability to meet the aforementioned requirements.  Companies are also encouraged to submit samples for evaluation.  Any information/samples submitted will not be returned, and no payment will be made by the government for such samples.  The testing results will be controlled and used for governmental purposes only.  Responses to this notice are to be sent to Mr. Marc Mathews, Multifunctional Materials Team, ATTN: AMSRD-NSC-WS-TM, 15 Kansas St., Natick, MA 01760-5019.  This notice is for market survey only.

<p>DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE <br />FEDERAL BUREAU OF PRISONS<br />JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION<br />Pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1(a)(1) and 6.302-1(a)(2) and the Bureau of Prisons Acquisition Policy Subpart 6.304(a), the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) has determined the use of other than full and open competitive procedures is justified for this procurement action. The following is supporting documentation in accordance with FAR Subpart 6.303-2, Content. <br /><br />1. Contracting Agency - United States Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons, Central Office, Administration Division, Acquisitions Branch, National Acquisitions Section.</p>
<p>2. Description of Action - Information, Policy and Public Affairs Division has a requirement to renew six annual software subscriptions for West Publishing Corporation's American Jurisprudence CD-Rom version. The American Jurisprudence software provides six BOP institutions various law publications for the inmate law libraries.</p>
<p>3. Description of Supplies and Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs - Inclusive of the Estimated Value - The BOP requires six annual software subscriptions for the American Jurisprudence. The software subscription will consist of six CD-Rom's which will allow one user per CD-Rom access to the law publications. The renewal of the American Jurisprudence software will provide inmates access to the law publications as required by BOP's Program Statement (P.S.) 1315.07.</p>
<p>The estimated value of the annual subscription is $32,961.60.</p>
<p>4. Statutory Authority Substantiating this Action - FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements - (1) Citations: 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1).</p>
<p>5. Reason for Authority Cited - The BOP requires the use of the law publications at each of the six institutions. American Jurisprudence provides access to various law publications for the inmate law libraries. The BOP must provide inmates access to various law publications as stated in BOP's P.S. 1315.07. Without the renewal of the American Jurisprudence subscription, the BOP will not be supporting the above referenced Program Statement. The agency's need for the American Jurisprudence CD-Rom subscriptions can only be provided by one source. West Publishing Corporation owns the propriety rights to this software. The services required are not available from another source.</p>
<p>6. Efforts to Obtain Competition - Market research was conducted to determine if any authorized resellers could provide the American Jurisprudence CD-Rom subscriptions, but the software is proprietary to West Publishing Corporation and they do not have any authorized resellers. Through market research, West Publishing Corporation is the only firm eligible to provide the required subscription, therefore, competition could not be obtained.</p>
<p>7. Contracting Officer's Fair and Reasonable Cost Determination - A review of West Publishing Corporation's proposed price was completed by the Contracting Officer. Based on market research, it was determined that the company's established pricing is the same for Government and Corporation subscribers. The price offered by West Publishing Corporation is considered fair and reasonable based on market research, historical data, and previously paid prices.</p>
<p>8. Market Survey - Market research was conducted to see if West Publishing Group had any authorized resellers that could offer the product that the BOP needs to fulfill this requirement. The result of the research conducted confirms that West Publishing Group is the only one vendor that can fulfill this requirement.</p>
<p>9. Other Factors - The subscription service is required to maintain the American Jurisprudence CD-Rom license to enable inmates to conduct legal research in the inmate law libraries at the BOP's institutions. Not renewing this subscription would not adhere to the BOP's P.S. 1315.07, as this software is necessary to provide the inmates with various law publications.</p>
<p>10. List of Sources - West Publishing Group owns the proprietary rights to the American Jurisprudence subscription software.</p>
<p>11. Action to be Taken to Promote Future Competition - Not Applicable.</p>
<p>12. Contracting Officer's Certification - I hereby certify that this request for Limited Source Justification is made in good faith, that the supporting data and information are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.//s// Kristina Sullivan, Contract Specialist, National Acquisition Section</p>
<p>13. Requirements Certification - I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance which are included in this Justification are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.//s// Denise Lomax, BOP Librarian, Information, Policy and Public Affairs Division</p>
<p>14. Concurrence - I certify that the above justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.//s// Donald G. Sinsel, Senior Contract Specialist, National Acquisitions Section</p>

An article is considered a product of a country only if it is wholly a product of that country or if it has been substantially transformed in that country into a new and different article of commerce with a name, character, or use distinct from that of the original article(s). Note that any item that is a discreet article as it is sold in commerce, regardless of its ultimate function or use, cannot be considered substantially transformed based solely on its integration into IT or other systems.<BR><BR>The Contractor and its employees shall exercise the utmost discretion in regard to all matters relating to their duties and functions. They shall not communicate to any person any information known to them by reason of their performance of services under this contract which has not been made public, except in the necessary performance of their duties or upon written authorization of the Contracting Officer.  All documents and records (including photographs) generated during the performance of work under this contract shall be for the sole use and become the exclusive property of the U.S Government. Furthermore, no article, book, pamphlet, email, recording, broadcast, speech television appearance, film or photograph concerning any aspect of work performed under this contract shall be published or disseminated through any media without the prior written authorization of the Contracting Officer. These obligations do no cease upon the expiration or termination of this contract.  The Contractor shall include the substance of this provision in all contracts of employment and in all subcontracts hereunder.<BR><BR>BusinessObjects The Diplomatic Security Chief Technology Office (DS/CTO) is seeking the purchase of additional Business Objects software licenses in order to expand the user base of this product. Over the past few years the amount of data collected by Diplomatic Security has dramatically increased. This has increased the number of metrics and reports necessary in order to make effective business decision on the direction of many programs within the bureau. The Web Intelligence suite allows these business owners to generate the necessary reports from the data warehouses generated by the Software Branch for their consumption. The use of automated reporting tools allows for a greater flexibility to be conducted by fewer people in less time. The supplies/services requested in this justification are for additional licenses for the Business Objects products already in use. This purchase also includes support that will provide technical assistance from the vendor and product upgrades during the maintenance period (1 year). As publisher of Web Intelligence, Business Objects is the sole provider of support and maintenance of the product. Business Objects has been able to make available to DS/CTO product and subject matter experts. The in-person and remote availability and support of Business Objects personnel have been a valuable part of the overall adoption and use of Web Intelligence within DS. Only one responsible source and no other supplies and services will satisfy agency requirements. Business Objects, as the maker of the Web Intelligence Suite, is the sole provider of maintenance and licensees. Business Objects does not work with resellers, preferring to sell direct. Purchasing new licenses and maintenance would be extremely costly to the Government to replace Business Objects Web Intelligence Suite with a like product. A ward to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. DS/CTO keeps current with regard to new and emerging software development tools by reviewing technical publications, checking vendors' web sites, and soliciting evaluations from vendors. Therefore, if and when a product or products become available that is/are comparable or superior to Business Objects, then DS/CTO will perform a technical assessment, in cluding a benefit/cost analysis, to determine whether to retain this product or to transition to anew, more cost-efficient product. <BR><BR>

(b) Under Section 8(a), the following types of activities are not forbidden ``compliance with the boycott,'' and are therefore exempted from Section 8(a)'s prohibitions listed in paragraphs (a)(1)-(6) above:    (1) Complying or agreeing to comply with requirements:    (i) Prohibiting the import of goods or services from Israel or goods produced or services provided by any business concern organized under the laws of Israel or by nationals or residents of Israel; or,    (ii) Prohibiting the shipment of goods to Israel on a carrier of Israel, or by a route other than that prescribed by the boycotting country or the recipient of the shipment;<BR><BR>(2) Complying or agreeing to comply with import and shipping document requirements with respect to the country of origin, the name of the carrier and route of shipment, the name of the supplier of the shipment or the name of the provider of other services, except that no information knowingly furnished or conveyed in response to such requirements may be stated in negative, blacklisting, or similar exclusionary terms, other than with respect to carriers or route of shipments as may be permitted by such regulations in order to comply with precautionary requirements protecting against war risks and confiscation;    (3) Complying or agreeing to comply in the normal course of business with the unilateral and specific selection by a boycotting country, or national or resident thereof, of carriers, insurance, suppliers of services to be performed within the boycotting country or specific goods which, in the normal course of business, are identifiable by source when imported into the boycotting country;    (4) Complying or agreeing to comply with the export requirements of the boycotting country relating to shipments or transshipments of exports to Israel, to any business concern of or organized under the laws of Israel, or to any national or resident of Israel;    (5) Compliance by an individual or agreement by an individual to comply with the immigration or passport requirements of any country with respect to such individual or any member of such individual's family or with requests for information regarding requirements of employment of such individual within the boycotting country; and,    (6) Compliance by a U.S. person resident in a foreign country or agreement by such person to comply with the laws of that country with respect to his or her activities exclusively therein, and such regulations may contain exceptions for such resident complying with the laws or regulations of that foreign country governing imports into such country of trademarked, trade named, or similarly specifically identifiable products, or components of products for his or her own use, including the performance of contractual services within that country, as may be defined by such regulations.<BR><BR>(a) The contractor warrants the following:    (1) That is has obtained authorization to operate and do business in the country or countries in which this contract will be performed;    (2) That is has obtained all necessary licenses and permits required to perform this contract; and,    (3) That it shall comply fully with all laws, decrees, labor standards, and regulations of said country or countries during the performance of this contract.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for Brand Name commercial items in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(c), Application for Brand Name descriptions, and the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; a fixed price quotation is requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is NAMA-08-Q-0146 and is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-26 effective June 12, 2008. This is a Brand Name,100% small business set-aside requirement under NAICS 334112 with a size standard of 1,000 employees. BACKGROUND: The NWCD has a well established office devoted to making high quality digital copies of NARA holdings. As the lab expands its capabilities to ensure NARA keeps pace with increasing internal and public demands, new equipment and computers are needed. The workflow and training in the lab has been standardized on the Macintosh operating system.  Any re-configuration to incorporate new, non-compatible systems would seriously disrupt existing processes in order to allow for system integration with existing components and software as well as new training for staff.  A hybrid process wherein NARA utilizes more than one type of computer is counter intuitive as it would create inefficiencies as opposed to generating any improvements.  As such the only real solution would be a complete replacement and this option is cost prohibitive from both time (such a transition would shut down the lab) and fiscal perspectives.  Therefore, only Macintosh computers are requested.  The Government will not be responsible for any costs incurred in responding to this notice. REQUIREMENTS: This is a Brand Name, firm-fixed price RFQ and all delivery costs should be included in total estimated value.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13. This solicitation document incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through the June 2008 Federal Acquisition Regulation revision, which includes the consolidation of all Federal Acquisition Circulars through 2005-26. This acquisition is NOT a small business set-aside and the NAICS code is 519190. This announcement constitutes the formal Request for Quotation (RFQ) and NO additional written solicitation will be issued.

It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure information services from SureScripts-RxHub on a sole source basis. 

Background:

For a project aimed to speed and improve the management of sick and/or injured people during a disaster, the Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications (LHC) requires access to a large national on-line prescription information database that supports real-time querying. Such access is an essential component of LHCs Automatic access to prescription records for managing patients involved in disasters project.  The objective of the project is to study the usefulness of prescription information obtained automatically from an on-line database in the management of patients, especially in the context of disasters. Information about current medications is the most important single category of information for good clinical decisions and in disasters such information would not usually be available to the care provider, unless it could be obtained through automatic means. 

The on-line database should provide coverage for a majority of the patients who are likely to seek care in the facilities that are part of this project.  The querying should use a secure connection with strong protection for patient confidentiality. Reports on medications should be in a summarized form to facilitate quick comprehension by clinical care providers.

Period of Performance: Base Year with Two (2) Additional Option Years.
  
Specifications:

The professional services to be provided consist of the following tasks:

(1) Establish the connection between the NLM hub and the services central database. 

(2) Accept HL7 ADT messages (with constrained content) about patients seeking care at the target health care organizations. Provide patient linking services with high specificity and respond in real time with HL7 vs. 2.x message containing that prescription information.  The use of HL7 version 2.x messages is also essential, because it is the only readily available mechanism for interfacing with health care institutions.  Use high level security mechanisms including high level encryption for all of the communications.  Apply processes and procedures to maintain confidentiality of all identified information.  Maintain high level of service with high availability and short turn-around time. We expect a minimal amount of unscheduled downtime and rapid return to service. 

The services will be provided to the target institutions during the period of performance.

Deliverables:

The service provider will provide messaging and medication delivery services as defined above. It will also provide monthly reports including a comprehensive summary of the number of transactions and records retrieved (number of queries, patients positively identified and patients with a medication profile) and the amount of scheduled/unscheduled downtime.

SureScripts-RxHub is uniquely qualified to provide this service. Today in the US and Canada, almost all prescriptions filled by community pharmacies are processed through pharmacy benefit management systems. The pharmacist enters the prescription into their pharmacy system which then forwards the prescription to the pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) for immediate adjudication of prescription price and co-pays according to the prescribers insurance plan. The PBMs maintains a data base of all filled prescriptions for at least a year. SureScripts-RxHub is a consortium of PBMs whose members together include two-thirds of the U.S. prescriptions paid for by private insurance in their data bases  a total of more than 2.5 billion prescriptions per year.  Through third party vendors SureScripts-RxHub already provides query and delivery of prescription medication via HL7 messages to assist hospitals with medication reconciliation and clinical care.  They have the tools in place to perform the specified tasks, which is important to our time line. There is no other on-line source of prescription data comparable to SureScripts-RxHub in terms of scale and coverage. Hospitals that have utilized SureScripts-RxHub are generally satisfied with their service.

Information received in a timely manner will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<SUBJECT>Closing Services for NRCS Conservation Easements
<SOLNBR>AG-21J2-S-08-0002
<RESPDATE>093008
<CONTACT>Rhonda J Tyndall, Contracting Officer, Phone 302-678-4163, Fax 302-678-0843, Email rhonda.tyndall@de.usda.gov
<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is initiating multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) with qualified closing agents for use by the NRCS in obtaining conservation easements in Delaware.  The conservation easements will be for wetlands and other conservation practices in accordance with the Wetlands Reserve Program and other Farm Bill programs.  The contractor shall furnish all closing services, including obtaining title insurance from a title company approved by the U.S. Attorney General.  The contractor will perform the same closing services as a commercial transaction, including abstracting, disbursement of funds, obtaining deeds and any necessary curative instruments to assure merchantable title to the conservation easement.   This acquisition is set aside for small business.  The NAICS code is 541191 and the size standard to qualify as a small business is less than $6,500,000 average annual gross receipts for the past three (3) years.   

The contractor should complete the Bid Schedule in Attachment #2.  The estimated start date for the BPA is October 6, 2008 and it will remain in effect until cancelled by either party.  We envision entering into multiple BPAs covering NRCS closing service needs for several years.  All interested companies are invited to submit proposals for consideration and award of a BPA.  Proposals are due no later than September 30, 2008.  Proposals may be submitted by fax to Rhonda J. Tyndall, Contracting Officer, USDA, NRCS (302) 678-0843, or mail to USDA NRCS, Attn:  Rhonda Tyndall, Contracting Officer, 1221 College Park Drive Suite 100, Dover, DE 19904.

A BPA is a method of filling anticipated repetitive needs.  It is not a contract.  The Government is not obligated to place any orders nor are contractors obligated to accept any orders.  For each work assignment, the Government will request title services from those that have been awarded BPAs.  A Scope of Services outlining required services will be provided with each request.

Individual task order proposals shall be submitted in accordance with the terms agreed to in the BPAs.  Government personnel authorized to place task orders under the BPAs will be identified on the BPAs by name and telephone number.  The contractor will be expected to furnish the service in accordance with the terms and conditions of the BPA, without need for additional paperwork beyond the Scope of Services that accompanies the request for proposal.

Timely delivery of complete and accurate title commitments is crucial to the success of NRCS programs.  Task orders will be assigned to the successful applicants requesting title services.  Task orders are to be completed within fourteen (14) days of the task order date.  If the vendor is unable to provide the title work within the 14 day period, NRCS is to be notified; otherwise it is expected to receive completed title work within 14 days.

Central Contractor Registration:  All contractors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) to be awarded a BPA.  You may register easily and quickly online at www.ccr.gov or 1-888-227-2423.  The first step to registering is to obtain a Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number, which is a unique nine-character identification number provided by the commercial company Dun and Bradstreet (D&B).  To request a DUNS number call D&B at 1-866-705-5711 or register online at http://www.dnb.com.  Obtaining a DUNS number through this process is free of charge.  It behooves anyone who is submitting a quote to begin this process as soon as possible since it can take several days to complete.  Failure to register may cause a rejection of your offer.

Contractors wishing to enter into a BPA must summit the following:

a.	Provide Contractor Name, Address, Phone, FAX, E-mail, and Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number.
b.	Return the completed Bid Schedule, specifying pricing for Preliminary Title Commitments and the counties in Delaware in which you are willing to complete title work (See Attachment #2).
c.	Identify and provide qualification information for key personnel (and any regularly and frequently used subcontractors) expected to participate in the work under the BPA, including years of experience, types of appraisals prepared, experience with conservation easements, and staffing levels.
d.	Describe your ability to perform in a timely manner and in compliance with performance schedules.
e.	Describe your ability to perform simultaneously on multiple title services.
f.	Provide a listing of previous experience in completing Government requested title Services.  Please provide a point of contact for each Government contract that you have previously work on.
g.	Meet the following requirements:

All title evidence must be obtained from qualified attorneys, abstracters, or title companies familiar with the preparation of such evidence in Delaware.  They should have no interest in the land to be acquired; and not be related to the vendors.  Title companies and their issuing agents must be qualified and authorized by law to furnish abstracts, certificates of title, or title insurance policies in the State of Delaware.

The Government will issue multiple Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offerors whose offers conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government.  All proposals submitted will be evaluated on the basis of the evaluation factors listed below:

a.	Ability to provide personnel with the education and experience required to perform the work described in the Scope of Services.
b.	Ability to perform in a timely manner and in compliance with performance schedules and quality of work for title work performed.
c.	Ability to perform simultaneously on multiple title services.
d.	Past experience in performing the work described in the Scope of Services, as well as experience in the area proposed.  Past performance ratings demonstrating a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely delivery of quality services at fair and reasonable prices.
e.	Price.

A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror, shall result in an agreement.  The Agreement places no obligation on the Government to purchase a minimum amount of services.  The Government is obligated only to the extent of authorized orders actually placed against the Agreement.

The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIRSYSCOM) PMA-275 intends to award a Task Order modification on a Sole-Source basis under BOA N00019-05-G-0008 to Raytheon Technical Services Corporation (RTSC) to provide services in the areas of V-22 Mission Planning System (VMPS), and Laboratory Management and Upgrade. This effort requires intricate knowledge of avionics systems, V-22 avionics simulation software, V-22 avionics laboratories, and related products used by the V-22 platform, which is poised for three key program milestones - Initial Operational Capability (IOC) for MV-22 occurring in FY08, Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E) for CV-22, also occurring in FY08, and CV-22 IOC in FY09.  RTSC is the only known source that has the prerequisite knowledge and expertise required to execute the following efforts without significantly impacting schedule and cost constraints of the program: 

(A) V-22 Mission Planning System (VMPS).  RTSC will deliver an additional (from 2 to 3) update release of the VMPS Lab Tools application, which includes changes required from aircraft interface updates, and support of JVX Application Software System (JASS) 3.5.0.8. 
 
(B)  Laboratory Management and Upgrade.  RTSC will perform the V-22 Electronic Systems Test Laboratory (VESTL) power system and safety upgrade.  Note:  This upgrade would address the original power distribution design of the VESTL to correct deficiencies in the layout and safety to meet Indiana code.  Also, the Emergency Shutoff design would be addressed to improve access to kill switches and incorporate electrical safety features into the VESTL.

The Navy intends to award a Sole-Source, Cost Plus Fixed Fee and Firm Fixed Price Task Order modification for this requirement.  The estimated period of performance is from 01 October 2008 through 31 December 2008.  The estimated issue date for this modification is 01 October 2008.  This synopsis is for information purposes only.*****

<DESC>Herman Miller supports the entire district and is interchangeable with all offices. This action supports the multiple moves and fluctuation of personnel in support of Europe Districts continuous changing mission and personnel manning requirements.  Changing to other furniture would eliminate our ability to modify configurations with on hand furniture, increase overall cost, and impact our ability to quickly react to personnel changes ISO mission growth. No other offeror can provide furniture that is interchangable with Heman Muller.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D.

COMDTINST 4200.14 Notice for Filing Agency Protests

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurers liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractors invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individuals behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION:     

(a)  Motorolas U.S. Federal Government Markets Division completed a system design and analysis in June of 2000 for Randolphs trunked radio system requirements.  The original purchase of repeater equipment was executed on order number F41691-01-F-0845. The system design and analysis along with all of the radio equipment used on Randolphs trunked radio system is proprietary intellectual property owned by Motorola.  As all existing equipment has been manufactured by Motorola, any additional equipment should remain uniform with the current configuration. There are no known third party resellers of the services contained in the proposal other than Motorola, Inc.   

(b)	 The technologies used in the Motorola SmartZone TLMR systems are proprietary intellectual property owned by Motorola.  Motorola is the only recognized source for system components and internal proprietary options to the planned expansion of the Randolph TLMR system.  If award of any part of this requirement were to be made to a source other than Motorola, it would have a significant and adverse effect on the operation of the system including the voiding of existing warranties.

<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested (use attached bid sheet) and a written solicitation will not be issued. Alternate proposals are not allowed. The Government intends to evaluate proposals and make award without discussions.&nbsp;The solicitation number (F1J5AF8213A002) is issued as a request for proposal (RFP) which will result in a Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity Contract(IDIQ). This solicitation document incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-26.&nbsp;This solicitation is 100% set-aside for small business concerns. The associated NAICS code is 518210, and the small business size standard is $25M.&nbsp;This requirement consists of three (3) contract line items numbers (CLINS):0001 - FFP - MicroFiche Scanning Services; 0002 - FFP - Microfilm Scanning Services - 16MM Continuous; and 0003 - FFP - Microfilm Scanning - 16MM Mixed . Period of Performance under this contract shall be from effective date of award through 30 Sep 2010. Description: The Contractor shall provide scanning services to the Aeromedical Consultation Service - ECG Library IAW Performance Work Statement, dated 21 August 2008. The place of performance will be at the contractor site. The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial, applies to this solicitation. The provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this solicitation. (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 1.) Technical approach to meet the requirements of the Performance Work Statement. The technical approach should include steps to ensure HIPPA compliance while handling and transporting materials to be scanned. 2.) Past Performance. Past performance will be evaluated based on an assessment of the contractors submission of past performance information. Each offeror will be assigned one of the following performance confidence assessments:</p>
<p>TABLE 3- PERFORMANCE CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENTS<br />Rating Description<br />Substantial Confidence Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a high expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>Satisfactory Confidence Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has an expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>Limited Confidence Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has a low expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>No Confidence Based on the offeror's performance record, the government has no expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br /><br />Unknown Confidence No performance record is identifiable or the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned.</p>
<p><br />3) Price - The total evaluated price will be determined by multiplying the unit prices to the maximum quantity of images for CLINS 0001, 0002 and 0003. The three CLIN prices will be summed to determine the total evaluated price. Technical approach and past performance when combined are more important than price.&nbsp;A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. Evaluation procedures outlined in FAR 15.304 shall apply to the acquisition.

Are Panamanian Work Visas a requirement for this INL Contract and if so, is there expedite assistance available from the US Mission / Embassy to help?

Answer:  The work Visa issue would have to be resolved between the company, SAN and the GOP. Embassy may offer assistance through NAS on a case by case basis.

Is an incumbent performing this service at this time and if so what is the contract value?

Answer:  No current service is provided. This is a start up contract.

Is there any requirement to provide helicopters or other support equipment?

Answer:  All equipment is provided by the SAN

How many copies of applicable manuals, as stated in the SOW under Standardization, for training, maintenance and safety, need to be provided?

Answer:  This needs to be worked out between contractor, SAN and NAS. NAS will obtain manuals once identified.

How many flight crew members will need to receive Cockpit Resource Management Training?

Answer:  SANs ultimate desire is to have crews that can operate up to 6 helicopters.

Will our Standardization Pilots be required/authorized to conduct flight evaluations?

Answer:  This will depend on the SAN and the contractor. Flight operations will be permitted in training missions/situations only. No actual missions will use US personnel.

Does every team member, to include the logistics advisor, need to speak/write English& Spanish at Level 3/3 or can we deploy personnel that have a team ability to communicate at the 3/3 Spanish level? 

Answer:  Language proficiency should be to a level that personnel can communicate with the SAN personnel. Any formal written reports that need to be presented to the SAN or GOP will be done through the NAS translator. 

What is the current skill and proficiency level of the maintenance and QC personnel If all programs will guided by FAA regulations will all Host nation personnel require A&P licenses?

Answer:  The skill sets are going to range from basic bare minimum to some guys that have some advanced skills. Most of them are not used to maintaining best practices no matter their skill set. It is not required that they obtain A&P licenses.

Will any Aircraft publications be available and if yes will a list be provided?

Answer:  They do have some publications. There pubs will most likely be incomplete and in some cases outdated. SAN can provide a list of what they have before a contractor comes down.

Will Facilities and adequacy of tooling to accomplish maintenance support at a minimum AVUM and AVIM levels.

Answer:  They have sufficient facilities. They also posses the majority of tools. SAN and NAS will work together to complete purchase of any required items.

What are the current Pilot readiness and currency levels at this time? 

Answer:  Currency for most pilots is expired. They are all behind do to lack of operational aircraft. They also have not been conducting adequate checkrides, etc to the best of our knowledge.

Is pilot and crew NVG qualification and currency a consideration?

Answer:  They have no NVG currency or qualifications. That would be nice to have but we need to have them get basic programs up and running before even thinking about NVGs.

It assumed by the contractor that SAN Standardization program and   associated standards are not in compliance with USG standards or not utilized by SAN therefore implementation, oversight and hands on training plans will began from ground zero. 

Answer:  They have 8 going though basic pilot training at this time. They have close to 30 others with varying levels of experience.

How many current and qualified pilots do the SAN have now to sustain operations for a six aircraft fleet operation?

Answer:  SAN does have current maintenance test pilots.

Conducting Maintenance Test Flights are not listed as a requirement but need to be considered since is a critical part of any maintenance operation. Will the SAN provide current and qualified MTP IAW INL standards?

Answer:  INL is not providing any aircraft. All helos are host nation owned. The aircraft are not at USG or INL standards. We are looking for a contractor to assist SAN in identifying deficiencies. At this time SAN is responsible for repairs or upgrades to aircraft. They currently have four aircrafts going through a major maintenance overhaul with a civilian company.

Is INL providing the BELL 212 aircraft to the SAN or the SAN providing the aircraft? The contractor understands that the aircraft will be maintained IAW with USG acceptable standards of performance according to OEM, FAA and INL approved programs. 

Answer:  Contractor will be responsible for this. Since aircraft are not INL owned we want to work with SAN to keep them as close to our specifications as possible. Historical records should be maintained.

In order to accomplish the aircraft maintenance program IAW established INL procedures inclusive within the maintenance paragraph sub A thru J, the contractor assumes that a complete historical, condition assessment and acceptance inspection of the aircraft will be accomplish either by the USG or contractor to determine condition and establish a functional program and that historical records will need to be maintained IAW US Army PAM 738-751.

Answer:  SAN is currently responsible to economically sustain the aircraft. GOP is investing several million dollars into the public forces in the next few months. We expect some of this money to go towards this program. We hope to establish an agreement between NAS and GOP prior to starting contractor operations. It has been verbally agreed upon prior to this bid.

Is INL providing SAN economical assistance to sustain the aircraft?

Answer:  SAN infrastructure is lacking. This will be a challenge for them. It will not be easy nor will it go perfect. I expect a fair level of frustration in trying to work with them. We are hoping to establish some guidelines with GOP prior to commencing that will ease the process.

Is SAN internally and externally capable of handling the logistics requirements? 

Answer:  We are looking to assist the SAN up to the limits of our capabilities. We will assist economically where possible, however the majority of that part is the responsibility of SAN/GOP. We will work with officials to achieve everything we can to ensure success.

For requirement for the repair and replacement of parts will they be only from OEM or can we go PMA?

Answer:  All records that SAN has will be made available.

Will safety history of SAN performance be made available to determine compliance with HN and INL requirements?

BASIS FOR PURCHASE ORDER AWARD 
The Offeror should demonstrate in its proposal that the objectives in the statement of work are understood and offer a logical approach to their achievement. Award will be made to the offeror who is deemed most responsive, whose proposal conforms to all requirements, and is judged to represent the best value. To conduct a best value assessment, FDA will evaluate the offerors proposal submission based on Technical Elements, Price, and Past Performance as described below. Technical, Past Performance, and Price are of equal importance. As this is a best-value selection, the government may make tradeoffs in the factors below to arrive at a best value decision. The Government may award a purchase order on the basis of initial offers received, without discussions. Therefore, each initial offer should contain the Offeror's best terms from a cost and technical standpoint. 

EVALUATION CRITERIA 
The evaluation will be based on the completeness, thoroughness and demonstrated capabilities of the prospective Offeror in relation to the needs of the project as set forth in the RFQ. Each proposal must document the feasibility of successful implementation of the requirements of the RFQ. The Offeror should show that the objectives stated in the proposal are understood and offer a logical program for their achievement. Offerors must submit information sufficient to evaluate their proposals based on the detailed criteria listed below. 

Offerors should provide information on all of the following criteria. 

A). Technical Solution 
Offerors shall demonstrate a thorough understanding of the scope and complexity of the Performance Work Statement. The Offeror shall, through a detailed technical proposal, be able to thoroughly explain the product the Government is seeking to obtain through this requirement. The Offeror, through its proposal, shall explain how it intends to obtain this product within the given time frame and in the most efficient and cost-productive manner. The Offeror must also show in its proposal the efforts required by the Government in order for the contractor to complete this task. Offerors must demonstrate that their share of savings reflects the risks involved and market conditions.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for Brand Name commercial items in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(c), Application for brand name descriptions, and the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; a fixed price quotation is requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is NAMA-08-Q-0144 and is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-26 effective June 12, 2008. There is no applicable set-aside for this requirement and competition is only constrained by the Brand Name requirement. BACKGROUND: The National Archives and Records Administration, has the requirement to maintain a Network that is up to date and complies with the NARA Enterprise Architectures Technology Standards Profile and Data Center standards.  The infrastructure hardware being procured integrates into the existing NARAs infrastructure seamlessly to provide cohesive and unified monitoring, configuration management and security controls from College Park, MD.  CISCO brand infrastructure equipment is necessary to effectuate the seamless integration into NARAs existing environment, and standardizing NARAs existing CISCO system will preclude the significant problems associated with network outages such as work stoppage and data loss.  We are now focusing on A1 and A2 to replace existing Network Switches to the same standard as the field sites.  Also, NH has a requirement to perform a technology refresh of some of the ADRRES/IRC IT system support components with IT hardware that is identical to the components currently utilized in the current production environment.  The current ADRRES/URTS switches are Cisco.  The infrastructure hardware being procured integrates into the existing NARAs NARANET standard infrastructure seamlessly to provide cohesive and unified monitoring, configuration management and security controls from College Park, MD.  Only Cisco brand parts will be considered for the essential security component of the ADRRES/IRC and URTS Technology Refresh projects.  As part of this technology refresh, we intend to install Cisco appliances to meet current FISMA security requirements for capturing system log in and activity. The Government will not be responsible for any costs incurred in responding to this notice. REQUIREMENTS: This is a Brand Name, firm-fixed price request and all delivery costs should be included in total estimated value.  
NARA requires that all Cisco products be purchased from Authorized/Certified Vendors Only.  Any and all vendors submitting quotes shall provide proof of authorization from Cisco.  Please refer to attached amendment.

Statement of Work

Executive Summary

The Corporation for National and Community Service (the Corporation, or CNCS) was created by the National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993 to engage Americans of all ages and backgrounds in service to their communities.  Through its three main programs - AmeriCorps, Learn and Serve America, and the National Senior Service Corps - the Corporation provides a broad range of opportunities for Americans to serve their communities and ultimately, the nation's challenges in the areas of education, public safety, human needs and the environment.

The Office of the National Service Trust (the Trust) issues educational awards to individuals who successfully complete a term of service in an AmeriCorps program and makes payments on their behalf.  The Trust is responsible for processing thousands of documents each year associated with the disbursement of payments to financial and educational institutions.  The volume of these documents has increased substantially each year with the enrollment of additional AmeriCorps members in the Trust and the increase in the number of disbursements each year.  

In order to better manage the delivery of paper documents, improve processing time and ultimately improve customer service, the Corporation seeks a quality contractor to provide first class mailing services.

Scope of Work:

The contractor shall provide first class mailing services.  The contractor shall print, insert, sort, and transport the pieces to the post office and mail those items by first class mail.  The contractor shall provide all materials, unless the Corporation stipulates otherwise [the Trust orders some envelopes], and shall pay for postage.  The contractor shall work with the Corporation to establish these mailing routines.  

Deliverables:
The successful contractor shall provide monthly reports to the requirements office on the volume and disposition of the mail processed and mail rejected due to erroneous addresses.  

Below are descriptions of these documents and an estimate of the number processed each year:

The documents to be processed and mailed on behalf of the Trust are:

1.	Voucher Package at the time of Award
2.	Voucher Package following Payment
3.	Vouchers on request
4. 	Form 1099-MISC
5.	VISTA W-2
6.	Special mailings

Voucher Package at the time of Award is mailed to AmeriCorps members when the award is granted. This page document provides the current account statement and various letters for future payments. Approximately 14,700 of these documents are mailed annually (58,800 Sheets).

Voucher Package following a Payment is sent to AmeriCorps members when some account activity, such as a payment or refund, occurs.  This four page document provides the current account statement and forms for future payments, if any balance remains.  A zero award balance creates a one-page document (approx. 50%).  An account statement occasionally generates an extra page due to the frequency of payments.  Approximately 11,500 of these documents are mailed annually (up to 28,750 sheets).

Vouchers on Request: Voucher packages are mailed to members on request (approx. 5 pages).  Approximately 5,000 are received annually. (25,000 sheets)

Form 1099-MISC is a federal tax form. This two page document includes a letter containing tax information. Approximately 50,000 of these forms are mailed annually (46150 sheets in January 2008).


Form W-2 is a federal tax form mailed to VISTA members at the beginning of each calendar year. This is a one page document. Approximately 12,000 forms are mailed annually.

Special mailings: the Corporation may authorize a special mailing as needed, its composition to be determined at that time.

The contractor shall have an electronic based system that is capable of retrieving, recording and mailing a large volume of documents; that is capable and flexible enough to manage various types of documents and forms; that has the ability to provide monthly statistical production reports and information on rejected mail; and that can perform a comprehensive zip code edit.  Documents with faulty addresses shall not be mailed out, and shall be returned to the Trust.

The Operating Environment - Hardware/Software

The Corporation currently operates in a mixed network environment. The Headquarters network is almost entirely Windows NT. Microsoft office XP is the standard office automation software used as the desktop operating system and Windows NT as the network operating system. The Trust uses an Oracle database system and Microsoft Windows NT. Electronic files are transferred weekly or as needed.  The Contractors hardware and software must be compatible with the Corporation's computer environment.  The contractor must work with the Corporation's Office of Information Technology (OIT) to create the required configurations for transmittals.

The Corporation for National & Community Service recommends that all quotations be sent via overnight carrier, hand carried to the Corporation, or sent electronically. 

All U.S. Postal Service deliveries are x-rayed, radiated, and scanned, which could delay or damage packaged materials.

<DESC><p>The solicitation number is FA8773-08-R-0054, and the solicitation is issued as a request for proposal (RFP). This amended solicitation/synopsis replaces FA8773-08-R-0054 in its entirety. Questions and Answers dated 8 Sep 08, have been updated and are posted to this site.</p>
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.</p>
<p><br />The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-23.</p>
<p>This acquisition will utilize full and open competition; there are no set asides for small businesses. For this acquisition, a concern will be considered small under NAICS 517110 with size standard of 1500 employees.</p>
<p>Simplified procurement procedures will be used for this acquisition per FAR Parts 12 and 13. This acquisition is determined to be subject to FAR Part 13, Test Program for Certain Commercial Services of the FAR regarding the acquisition of commercial services and also subject to FAR Par 15 regarding contracting by negotiation.</p>
<p>In accordance with Air Force (AF) Instruction 33-111, the 38th EIG is the only authorized contracting office to order local exchange telephone services for the AF including Air National Guard, AF Reserve and AF recruiting offices. 38 EIG/PKK has a requirement for awarding Firm-Fixed Price Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) for an effective period up to ten years in order to, on an as-needed basis, acquire local telephone exchange services for all AF sites throughout the United States (CONUS). All BPA calls are referenced herein as "Communication Service Authorizations" (CSAs) and subject to the terms and conditions of the BPA. Each CSA will generally have a five-seven year period of performance but can be issued from one to 10 years. Local telecommunications services shall include, as a minimum but not limited to, local access for ISDN PRI's, local exchange trunks, transport channels, point-to-point circuits, commercial business lines, internet services, voice mail, directory number and number portability, operator and directory assistance, local and Intra-LATA access, and interconnection with Inter-LATA exchange carrier.</p>
<p>38 EIG/PKK intends to negotiate multiple BPAs with qualified sources in order to competitively award CSAs for local exchange services. Responding to this synopsis in no manner guarantees a BPA will be negotiated with the respondent. The establishment of a BPA with a respondent in no way obligates the Government to issue any CSAs against the BPA. 38 EIG/PKK does not guarantee any minimum level of work under any resultant BPA. Individual CSAs will not exceed $5.5 million. There will be no limit to the number of CSAs issued under any of the prospective BPAs. The Government may issue orders requiring services at multiple locations. Only 38 EIG/PKK will be able to issue CSAs against the established BPAs. There is no specific commitment by either party, until dates, services, and schedule are mutually negotiated by individual CSAs against resulting BPAs. Offers may be submitted through February 2018. A respondent may at any time submit a proposal electronically via email or by fax requesting establishment of a BPA from the POC's e-mail listed in the announcement. Phone requests will not be accepted.</p>
<p>The scope of the work to be acquired for the BPA is set forth in the Statement of Work (SOW). The SOW, Pricing Sheet, and BPA terms and conditions are available for download herein.</p>

<p>Proposals will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Offers-Commercial, and the following addendum. <br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />EVALUATION CRITERIA. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />a. Technical Evaluation. Initially, the Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable. A decision on the technical acceptability of each Offeror's technical proposal shall be made. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for a BPA. The offers shall be evaluated against the following factors:<br />FACTOR 1 - Organizational Representatives. The factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing of each state the Offeror can provide services for under this BPA. In addition, this factor is met when the Offeror provides a listing, in hierarchical succession, of the Offeror's points of contact delegated specifically for this requirement. Listing includes the titles, phone numbers, fax numbers and email addresses for each representative applicable to each state. List shall include both contracting and technical representatives.<br />FACTOR 2 - Interconnection Agreements. This factor is met when the Offer provides documented evidence of CLEC (Competitive Local Exchange Carrier) interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort in each state and the Offeror is a facilities based firm. <br />FACTOR 3 - Evidence of Certification. This factor is met when the Offeror provides documentation IAW Clause 52.212-4, Addendum paragraph (q) (2) in order to provide the services for these types of requirements. For each state the Offeror is submitting the BPA proposal, the documentation and/or direct internet link must be provided.<br />Factor 4-Local Communications Services. The factor is met when the Offeror provides a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror understands and meets all the SOW requirements as a facilities based provider.</p>
<p>b. Past Performance Evaluation. BPA offeror's will be assessed a satisfactory past performance rating in order to obtain a BPA. CSA award decisions for defined requirements will be based on the Performance Price Tradeoff (PPT) technique in which competing Offerors' past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to price considerations. In determining past performance risk, the evaluators will employ several approaches including: reviewing the present and past performance; seeking present and past performance information through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. In determining risk, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, the impact of failure, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The purpose will be to identify and review relevant present and past performance, and then make an overall risk assessment of the BPA holder's ability to perform this specific effort. <br />This risk assessment represents the Source Selection Authority's judgment of the probability of a BPA holder successfully accomplishing the proposed effort based on the BPA holder's demonstrated present and past performance. The PPT process will result in an overall risk rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: Substantial Confidence (Based on the BPA holder's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the BPA holder will successfully perform the required effort); moderately Satisfactory Confidence (Based on the BPA holder's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the BPA holder will successfully perform the required effort); Limited Confidence (Based on the BPA holder's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the BPA holder will successfully perform the required effort; No Confidence (Based on the BPA holder's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the BPA holder will be able to successfully perform the required effort.); and Unknown Confidence (No performance record is identifiable or the BPA holder's performance record is so sparse that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned). The Government reserves the right to issue a CSA to other than the lowest priced BPA holder if the lowest priced BPA holder is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. An integrated assessment of price and past performance will be performed to determine which BPA holder represents the best value. An award shall be made to this BPA holder, subject to a positive determination of responsibility.<br />c. Price Evaluation. All pre-priced CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent local exchange carrier (LEC) or with any other local exchange carrier with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation. When the sites requirements are defined, proposals for price on the schedule B will be evaluated with the PPT process described in this solicitation.<br /><br />POINT OF CONTACT:<br />Barbara Winton, Contracting Officer, 38 EIG/PKK, 4001 Hilltop Rd, Tinker AFB OK 73145-2713, phone (405) 734-9907, Email barbara.winton@tinker.af.mil or 38 EIG.PKK@tinker.af.mil, Debbie Speir, Contracting Officer, 38 EIG/PKK, 4001 Hilltop Rd, Tinker AFB OK 73145-2713, Phone (405) 734-9675, Email debbie.speir@tinker.af.mil, or Todd Barron, Contract Specialist, todd.barron@tinker.af.mil (same address as above)or Maurice Smith, Contract Specialist, Maurice.Smith@tinker.af.mil.</p>

The contractor shall also be responsible for preventive maintenance and repairs. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) number for this effort is 238210. Please indicate your firms small business status. Contract award is estimated to take place August 2008. Source Selection procedures can be found in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 15.3-Source Selection, Air Force FAR Supplement (AFFARS) and the Air Force Materiel Command FAR Supplement (AFMCFARS) thereto. These regulations are available electronically at the Air Force (AF) FAR Site, http://farsite.hill.af.mil and will be used to obtain the best value for the Government for this acquisition. In using the best value approach, the Government will award to an offeror who gives the greatest confidence that they will best satisfy our requirements in an affordable manner. The draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) and draft Request for Proposal (RFP) will be posted incrementally on the internet at: http://www.fedbizopps.gov. This synopsis constitutes one form of early industry involvement and the Government requests industry recommendations, opinions, and feedback. This synopsis is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute a solicitation for bids/proposals. Responses will assist the Government in determining whether to set-aside/restrict competition in some way or solicit offers from all responsible sources. Prospected vendor must provide proof of small business representation through the Central Contract Registration (CCR) and Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA). The Government will not pay for any information submitted in response to this announcement. 5352.201-9101 OMBUDSMAN (AUG 2005) (a) An ombudsman has been appointed to consider and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. The ombudsman may not serve as an advocate for any party. (b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, concerned parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timeliness for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions). (c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Douglas P. Constant, AFFTC/PK, 5 S Wolfe Avenue, Edwards AFB CA 93524-1185, phone number (661) 277-2006, facsimile number (661) 277-3784.

The Contractor shall include the substance of this provision in all contracts of employment and in all subcontracts hereunder.<BR><BR>BusinessObjects
The Diplomatic Security Chief Technology Office (DS/CTO) is seeking the purchase of additional Business Objects software licenses in order to expand the user base of this product.  Over the past few years the amount of data collected by Diplomatic Security has dramatically increased.  This has increased the number of metrics and reports necessary in order to make effective business decision on the direction of many programs within the bureau. The Web Intelligence suite allows these business owners to generate the necessary reports from the data warehouses generated by the Software Branch for their consumption.  The use of automated reporting tools allows for a greater flexibility to be conducted by fewer people in less time. The supplies/services requested in this justification are for additional licenses for the Business Objects products already in use. This purchase also includes support that will provide technical assistance from the vendor and product upgrades during the maintenance period (1 year).
As publisher of Web Intelligence, Business Objects is the sole provider of support and maintenance of the product. Business Objects has been able to make available to DS/CTO product and subject matter experts. The in-person and remote availability and support of Business Objects personnel have been a valuable part of the overall adoption and use of Web Intelligence within DS.
Only one responsible source and no other supplies and services will satisfy agency requirements.    Business Objects, as the maker of the Web Intelligence Suite, is the sole provider of maintenance and licensees.  Business Objects does not work with resellers, preferring to sell direct.  
Purchasing new licenses and maintenance would be extremely costly to the Government to replace Business Objects Web Intelligence Suite with a like product. A ward to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. DS/CTO keeps current with regard to new and emerging software development tools by reviewing technical publications, checking vendors' web sites, and soliciting evaluationsfrom vendors. Therefore, if and when a product or products become available that is/arecomparable or superior to Business Objects, then DS/CTO will perform a technicalassessment, in cluding a benefit/cost analysis, to determine whether to retain this product or to transition to anew, more cost-efficient product.<BR><BR>

For health, comfort, and compatibility reasons, the Bureau of Diplomatic Security plans to procure Aeron ergonomic chairs from any of several potential vendors.
DS has a continuing need to provide its employees with a functional, practical, and healthy working environment.  A critical part of that environment is comfortable seating, given that most employees spend hours sitting at their computers.  Aeron chairs have been successfully used in the Bureau of Diplomatic Security for several years.  The chairs have been very reliable and the staff are fully content with the equipment.  It is impossible to tell how many injuries have been prevented or mitigated by use of these chairs, but it is safe to say that the use of Aeron ergonomic chairs greatly reduces these risks.
Aeron chairs are used almost exclusively in the Diplomatic Security Headquarters building.  In addition to the health benefits, the purchase of Aeron chairs would not detract from the overall appearance of various offices in the building.<BR><BR>

Airline Schedule Data are used to compute airport and airline performance metrics. The performance metrics, integrated into the Aviation System Performance Metrics (ASPM), are widely used within the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the airline and airport industry and the academic field to identify problems in the National Airspace System (NAS) and to take remedial tactical and strategic actions. The Flight Plan, which is the strategic roadmap of the FAA, includes system-wide metrics such as the percentage of on-time arrivals and gate arrival delays derived from the airline schedule data.  Specifically schedule data are used to provide the following services to the agency and outside stakeholders:
	Measurement of Delays: The actual flight time is compared to the schedule to derive delays. The delay metrics are part of the Flight Plan that is monitored daily by FAA, airport and airline analysts to measure airport and airline performance. 	Forecasting: Schedule data are used to evaluate airport traffic demand, capacity, and passengers. This activity is linked to airport development and resource planning.   
Work ScopeThe scope of work is divided into three tasks:
	Bi-Weekly Airline Data	Verbal Notification of Airline Reporting Error	Operational IT support

Interested Offerors must submit their proposals by no later than 11:00 a.m. EST, Wednesday September 17, 2008.  Offerors are advised that the FAA will not pay for any incurred costs associated with responding to this request for offer.

4.  This RFP includes the contract clause established by Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.228-3, Workers Compensation Insurance (Defense Base Act) or DBA.

<DESC>The U. S. EPA, Office of Research and Development (ORD), intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1, for NAS to provide an objective assessment and validation of scientific and engineering excellence in EPAs mission and programs; informing the Agency of relevant scientific and technical data and related views of experts about research and science activities; and to provide support in applying the judgments of science and engineering to public policy.  Under the proposed procurement, the National Research Council (NRC) of NAS will provide expert advice by convening review committees that will perform timely reviews and recommendations on a variety of issues associated with ORDs mission and programs.
EPA requires the services of an expert, highly prestigious and objective organization to provide independent advice and review of the high priority, cross-Agency science issues that comprise the EPA Science Agenda.  NAS is the only known source that can provide this broad range of scientific expertise at a level of objectivity and public acceptability that is critical to meet the EPAs needs under this procurement.  Objectivity and unbiased judgment are imperative because of the intense interest and scrutiny of the Agencys policies and decisions by the public, Congress, the regulated and environmental communities and other stakeholders.  
The National Academies members are without Peers in their field, with unquestioned objectivity and independence.  As the preeminent scientific organization in the nation, the NAS has the unique ability to assemble the nations most highly distinguished scholars and scientists to serve on boards and committees to address national environmental problems requiring scientific input that are of high priority and often of urgent need covering the full range of scientific and technical disciplines. 
An indefinite quantity type contract, with a maximum value of $25 Million, is anticipated.  The ordering period will be five years.  This notice is not a request for proposal.  No solicitation will be issued based on this notice.  However, any organizations believing itself capable of meeting EPAs needs may submit documentation to demonstrate its qualifications to meet the EPAs needs.  This documentation must be submitted to the POC within 15 days of electronic posting of this notice. 
Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  A determination not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  This acquisition is being processed under FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation.  The applicable NAICS code is 541690.  The anticipated award date is 12/30/08.  See Numbered Note 26.

Central Asia is bordered by Russia, China, Iran and Afghanistan.  Due to its substantial oil and gas reserves, it is a region of considerable geopolitical and strategic interest to the United States.  

The Regional Mission for Central Asia (USAID/CAR) is responsible for the strategic planning, program design and implementation, achievement of results, and reporting for the USAID assistance programs for the five Central Asian republics.  The U.S. Governments program of assistance in the region is focused on energy market and resources development, the growth of small-scale enterprise and trade; building a more open, democratic culture; better management of environmental resources, including energy; and improved primary healthcare.  It ranks as one of the Agencys largest programs, with funding levels that have averaged over $139*** million annually.  The Mission implements its programs together with more than 80 contractor and grantee teams.  The staff manages a program that addresses six Strategic Objectives (SO) principally focused on assisting these former communist states in making the transition to Western-style democracies with viable market economies.

The Mission currently has three technical offices: Office of Economic Growth (OEG), Democracy and Conflict Mitigation (DM), and Health and Education (HE).

<DESC><p>The purpose of the NIMH Psychoactive Drug Screening Program is to provide pharmacological and functional screening of novel synthetic compounds and natural products for potential use as research tools or probes for basic and clinical research, as therapeutic agents for mental disorders, and as PET, SPECT, and fMRI ligands for functional brain imaging,. This program is primarily intended as a screen for compounds that have previously been shown to possess pharmacological, biochemical, or behavioral activities relevant to NIMH and not for the purpose of large-scale, random screening of natural products or combinatorial libraries. However, limited screening may also be conducted on small libraries of synthetic or natural product compounds of unknown activity and on hit or lead compounds generated through NIH-funded HTS or chemistry programs.</p>
