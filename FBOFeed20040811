UTHSC is uniquely qualified to provide the above services for NLM’s outreach programs.  UTHSC is located in the lower Mississippi Delta region of the United States and has worked with the population of this area in the health arena.  This area is of particular interest to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) because of the large health disparities that exist there.  In addition, UTHSC houses a Center for Health Disparities with the stated goal to eliminate disparities in health outcomes through biomedical and behavioral research, promoting health system changes, and education of citizens, health care professionals, researchers, and other key stakeholders.  UTHSC has a high level of expertise with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and has experience in using GIS for health-related systems.  UTHSC also has the necessary infrastructure to carry out this work including computer facilities, programming staff, and a high level of cybersecurity.  

This service will be awarded under FAR Part 13 (Simplified Acquisitions).  

This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all interested parties may submit a capabilities statement which will be considered by the NLM.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to award a purchase order on a sole source basis under authority of FAR 6.302 to Nimiipuu Health, Nez Perce tribe of Idaho.  The purpose of this procurement is to initiate a Personal Digital Assistant computer project which addresses the need for mobile information access by health care providers (including the ability to read digital images and obtain lab results) of the Nez Perce tribe and enables members of the Nez Perce tribe to utilize the internet before or after being seen by the health care provider.  The period of performance shall be for eighteen months.
 
It is anticipated that the utilization of online information that is wireless, secure, and available to the provider at any given moment, will help improve the standard of care provided to the Nez Perce tribe.  It is further anticipated that this project will have a far reaching impact on the community because it serves to aid both the health care providers and the patients.  The project will benefit the Nez Perce tribe in their promotion of overall quality of care, and the National Library of Medicine in improving access to information in rural areas.

This project is a component of NLM’s Native American/Native Alaskan/Native Hawaiian information internship program called Sacred Root.  This is a unique opportunity for NLM to work with indigenous populations in the development of their capacity to use health information to improve the health and health care of their tribes.  The Information Internship pilot project includes nine tribes represented on the National Congress of American Indians President’s Task Force on Health Information.  The Nez Perce tribe was the second tribe to participate in the internship and is at the stage of implementing an information access project on the reservation.  Nimiipuu Health is uniquely qualified to provide the services currently being acquired.  Nimiipuu Health is the tribal healthcare provider on the Nez Perce reservation and there is no other organization or agency with which NLM can work to carry out these activities on the Nez Perce reservation.

This service will be awarded under FAR Part 13 (Simplified Acquisitions).  

This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all interested parties may submit a capabilities statement which will be considered by the NLM.

The system has to consist a display unit, a light emitter/receiver fish scanner, temperature logger, watertight box, operation and analysis software, connector box, battery cables and 110 volt charger. Extra components needed for the evaluation of this system should include a communication module to trigger an underwater camera, and underwater camera and different length cables. In addition, the fish counter, installed in the water, counts fish in in situ. This fish counter should provide two silhouettes of each fish counted, count up and downstream fish, calculate length , determine special tags and marks for stock assessment the fish, operate on battery power, capable of being linked to a data collection platform, and have potential to be used to identify fish to species that pass ands get counted.  The counted fish should not be able to sense the counter beams (consequently there is no avoidance bias), and the counter should be modifiable to a variety of water turbidities. The proposed action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b).  The reason justifying this sole source procurement is: Government believes that only one responsible source can provide the supplies that will satisfy the agency requirements. Any firm that believes it  can furnish the items described above are encouraged to give written notification to the Contracting Officer.  Supporting evidence must be furnished, in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements.   All responses received within 7 days of the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquiries will only be accepted by Fax at (303) 445-6345, Attention: Chau Nguyen.   Responses should include the firm's  business size [e.g. small business, other than small business] in accordance with the size standard: 500 employees for North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 334514.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics is the principal fact-finding agency for the Federal Government in the broad field of labor economics and statistics.  The BLS is an independent national statistical agency that collects, processes, analyzes and disseminates essential statistical data to the American public, the U.S. Congress, other Federal agencies and local governments, business, and labor.  This mission is supported by contracts for goods and services, which must be acquired and managed with the highest professional standards. Total cost for this requirement will NTE $12.000.

The HACU intern will work with senior Contract Specialists in the day to day duties involving the acquisitions stated above.  This includes learning and using an electronic procurement system to process simple purchase orders.  Going further professionally, the intern will assist in the senior specialist in the planning, execution, and award of contract actions. While the intern can not by law hold any Federal contracting authority, the intern will assist in the creation and management of the official legal contract file, be responsible for mandatory components of the official legal file, assist in the research and formal responses to inquiries under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), and perform computations of bids and pricing offers from vendors; these are significant responsibilities requiring a mature and businesslike approach to work (as this is a business office of the Federal government representing the Bureau to private sector vendors, the intern is expected to dress appropriately).  In addition, the intern will be given every opportunity to observe and assist in dispute resolution, terminations, and settlement agreements, as events allow.

It is the intent of the above to give the intern experience in a real-world, professional Federal contracting office, performing real and necessary work in an actual business environment, thereby enriching the experience for both the intern and the Bureau.

This notice of intent is not a request for offers. A determination not to compete this proposed procurement is solely within the discretion of the Government. There is no RFP notice. For information purposes only.

However, a written demand or written assertion by the Contractor seeking the payment of money exceeding $100,000 is not a claim until certified.  A voucher, invoice, or other routine request for payment that is not in dispute when submitted is not a claim.  The submission may be converted to a claim by complying with the submission and certification requirements of this clause, if it is disputed either as a liability or amount or is not acted upon in a reasonable time.
       (d)(1) A claim by the Contractor shall be made in writing and, unless otherwise stated in this contract, submitted within 6 years after accrual of the claim to the Contracting Officer for a written decision.  A claim by the Government against the Contractor shall be subject to a written decision by the Contracting Officer.
(2)(i) The Contractor shall provide the certification specified in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this clause when submitting any claim exceeding $100,000.
     (ii) The certification requirement does not apply to issues in controversy that have not been submitted as all or part of a claim.
     (iii) The certification shall state as follows: “I certify that the claim is made in good faith; that the supporting data are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief; that the amount requested accurately reflects the contract adjustment for which the Contractor believes the Government is liable; and that I am duly authorized to certify the claim on behalf of the Contractor”.
(3) The certification may be executed by any person duly authorized to bind the Contractor with respect to the claim.
       (e) For the Contractor claims of $100,000 or less, the Contracting Officer must, if requested in writing by the contractor, render a decision within 60 days of the request.  For contractor-certified claims over $100,000, the Contracting Officer must, within 60 days, decide the claim or notify the Contractor of the date by which the decision will be made.
       (f) The Contracting Officer’s decision shall be final unless the Contractor appeals to the Chief, Procurement Branch, UNICOR, Federal Prison Industries within 90 days of the date of the Contractor’s receipt of the adverse decision.  The decision of the Chief, Procurement Branch on a Contractor’s appeal will be final.
       (g) Within 10 days of the Contractor’s receipt of an adverse Contracting Officer’s decision on a claim, the Contractor may request, and Federal Prison Industries will participate in, non-binding alternative dispute resolution (ADR) by means mutually acceptable to the parties.  Any ADR shall be completed within 60 days of the Contractor’s request, unless the parties agree to a longer period.  A Contractor’s request for, and participation in, ADR will not toll the 90 day time limit within which to appeal an adverse Contracting Officer’s decision to the Chief, Procurement Branch.  
       (h) The Government shall pay interest on the amount found due and unpaid from (1) the date that the Contracting Officer receives the claim (certified, if required); or (2) the date that payment otherwise would be due, if that date is later, until the date of payment. With regard to claims having a defective certification, as defined in FAR 33.201, interest shall be paid from the date that the Contracting Officer initially receives the claim.  Simple interest on claims shall be paid at the rate, fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury, which is applicable to the period during which the Contracting Officer receives the claim and then at the rate applicable for each 6-month period as fixed by the Treasury Secretary during the pendency of the claim.

<DESC>This synopsis is issued for comments on the draft Request for Proposal, PWS and attachments only.  This requirement is to replace outdated mailing systems at 444 locations throughout the United States, Puerto Rico, Guam and various remote locations.  Installation shall also include Coast Guard cutters home ported on the east, west, and gulf coasts of the United States.  The U.S. Coast Guard processes millions of pieces of mail annually at more than 444 locations throughout the world, including aboard Coast Guard Cutters.  The Coast Guard Cutters often perform operations at sea for periods ranging from a few weeks to 6 months or more. As a result, the equipment type and maintenance program must ensure that cutters can sustain meter operations for these periods. While each of these locations has a designated Official Mail Manager, this is not a full-time position and processing mail is a collateral duty shared by many different personnel.  Consequently, the Coast Guard relies on automation to minimize errors and the time spent handling and processing mail.  A copy of the RFP and PWS with attachments can be obtained from FedBizOpps following this listing. Interested parties are strongly encouraged to download their own copy of the draft RFP.  Industry comments will be fully considered in preparation for the final RFP.  The USCG will not provide individual responses, and requests that no general telephone or email inquiries be made to the Contracting Officer or any USCG employee. Comments on the draft RFP, PWS and attachments shall be submitted no later than February 23, 2004, 11:00 a.m. (EST).  All responses must be submitted electronically to Ms. Faye Jones, fjones@comdt.uscg.mil. This request for comment is not a commercial solicitation and the Government will not pay for any information submitted or for any costs associated with providing this information.

At the level of the PRIME Recipient, THIS PROJECT IS RESTRICTED TO STATE GOVERNMENTS, STATE DEPARTMENTS OF TRANSPORTATION, CITY GOVERNMENTS, CITY DEPARTMENTS OF TRANSPORTATION, OTHER CITY AGENCIES, COUNTY GOVERNMENTS, COUNTY DEPARTMENTS OF TRANSPORTATION, COUNTY AGENCIES, AND METROPOLITAN PLANNING ORGANIZATIONS.   The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) hopes to issue two or more Cooperative Agreements enabling the FHWA to partner with State, local, and/or Regional PUBLIC entities of the type just mentioned, in order to use their services and creativity to assess, demonstrate and further develop----from the realm of theory to that of real-world practice----the idea of a Regional Concept for Transportation Operations.   Each Recipient shall:  enhance or expand the efforts of existing regional transportation operations collaboration and coordination in one or more operational activities to be identified by the applicant; enhance and sustain processes for regional transportation operations collaboration and coordination that describe how the region works to achieve its objectives; based on the work just described, develop and implement a Regional Concept for Transportation Operations in one or more operational activities within each region; cooperate with the FHWA and an independent evaluator (to be funded SEPARATELY from, and OUTSIDE, these Cooperative Agreements) by sharing operational collaboration and coordination experiences and expectations prior to the demonstration project, during the demonstration project, and beyond the demonstration project;  coordinate key activity with the independent evaluator and accommodate that independent evaluator’s presence at these activities; submit monthly status reports electronically; submit Quarterly Progress Reports; and submit a Final Report.  The FHWA plans to select REGIONALLY-oriented entities representing at least two DIFFERENT metropolitan areas.   Two or more public entities of the type mentioned above would----IF they CHOSE----be allowed to TEAM UP as a partnership within a SINGLE proposal (Application) for a single Cooperative Agreement----PROVIDED that the Application explicitly DESIGNATES one and ONLY one of those partnering entities as the one and ONLY one PRIME Recipient of the Cooperative Agreement.  A maximum of $200,000 in Federal funds per metropolitan area (i.e., per Cooperative Agreement) will be provided over a two-year period, and that funding will INCLUDE amounts of up to $100,000 to be provided to each Cooperative Agreement in EACH YEAR.   At the level of the SUBrecipient (i.e., subcontractor), the Federal funding may NOT be used to pay for services rendered by any organization of a type DIFFERENT from the permissible PRIME types listed above; the only EXCEPTION to that restriction regarding subs is that ANY type of sub may provide PERIPHERAL support such as:  (a) helping to organize or facilitate meetings or workshops; and (b) providing DOCUMENTATION and PACKAGING for the Regional Concept for Transportation Operations.  There will be no Pre-Proposal Conference.  The DUE DATE shown above for submission of Applications is only an ESTIMATED date; the ACTUAL due date will be published in the Request for Applications (RFA), and the RFA will be published hereafter in THIS website (http://www.eps.gov).  Prospective Applicants (bidders) are strongly advised to closely MONITOR this source for any AMENDMENTS that might hereafter be issued to this Synopsis; and they are strongly advised to also closely MONITOR FedBizOpps for the published RFA and for any AMENDMENTS that might be issued to the RFA.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this announcement. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  Synopsis/Solicitation FA8751-04-Q0793 is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ), for a firm fixed-priced order incorporating provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-24 and DFARS Change Notice DCN 20040625. See http://farsite.hill.af.mil for the full text of all provisions and clauses incorporated by reference herein.  Additional information may be obtained at FedBizOpps. The NAICS code is 334111 for this acquisition with a small business size standard of 1000 employees.  Items include: A computer that includes the following specifications:

4 high resolution display channels, 6 RGB inputs, 6 RGB output window processors, 16 composite video inputs, 8 S-video inputs, 1 4U
rackmount main chassis, Dual (2) Xeon processors @2.4 GHz, 2048MB
memory, Dual removable 20 GB disk drive, 48x CD-R / 24x CD-RW CD-ROM
drive, 1.44MB floppy drive, 2 10/100/1000 Mb/s RJ-4S Ethernet 
connectors, (Ports: 1 parallel, 2 USB, 1 serial), PS/2 104 keyboard,
PS/2 mouse, one year limited hardware warranty, 90 day installation
assistance via phone and email. Please be advised that the appropriate software must be listed and quoted (such as multiple channel drivers and unix connectivity).  Also, one year support on software is necessary.  The 4U chassis is an absolute requirement.  Not only that, but the chassis depth cannot exceed 26 inches.  The reason is that it can't interfere with the collapse of Government Equipment (the system is 24 inches in depth). The configuration must allow for an empty PCI slot so we can integrate a Matrox Meteor-II/Multi-channel frame grabber card. That means it must work with all the other components it requires.  Furthermore, the employment of Xeon processors is a must.  It must meet or exceed the dual 2.4GHz requirement. The system must be able to drive a 1X3 SXGA rear-projection display.  These outputs must have the ability to be tiled as one integrated display.  There is no requirement to share these outputs to other devices whether these are monitors or other projectors.  Each channel must meet or exceed 32MB SGRAM per graphic channel and support the required resolution per channel.  The output signal configuration preferable is DVI-I. The six HD15 inputs must meet a minimum of 160 MHz pixel clock and be of RGB w/ any type of sync format.  The system must be able to display all six inputs simultaneously.  These display outputs can be placed anywhere on the display and be handled (size, minimize, maximize, etc.) by the display server.  The interface must treat these outputs like any other window.  The API provided must allow us the ability to handle these inputs as we see fit. It is of particular importance that the output windows be shared between tiles without loss of any signal (timing must be handled efficiently and accurately). The 16 composite and eight S-Video inputs must be of NTSC, PAL or SECAM or mixed format.  We must be able to display four of these inputs simultaneously anywhere on the display.

Any quotes received must be equal to or exceed the specifications listed above.  Partial awards will not be considered. The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items, applies; provide with your quotation all the data requested by FAR 52.212-1.  Failure to do so may eliminate you from consideration for award.  Evaluation will be made based the Lowest Bid Technically Acceptable. Submit a completed copy of FAR 52.212-3 and DFAR 252.212-7000, Offeror Representations and Certification-Commercial Items, with your quotation.  See the FedBizzOpps.  FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items and FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items (Dev), apply to this acquisition. FAR 52.252-2, Clause incorporated by Reference can be found at http://farsite.hill.af.mil/.  Additional DFARS 252.212-7001, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Applicable to Defense Acquisitions of Commercial Items, applies.  To be eligible to receive a contract award from a Department of Defense (DoD) activity, you must be registered in the DoD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Database.  To register, access the CCR Home Page at http://www.ccr.gov/. QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION MUST BE DIRECTED IN WRITING TO THE BUYER, LT MARK JOHNSON, NO LATER THAN ONE WEEK BEFORE THE QUOTATION DUE DATE.  QUOTATIONS ARE DUE AT 2:30 PM EST, FRIDAY, 10 SEP 2004.

Proposal receipt date is approximate. 

During the term of the contract, the Government may authorize customers to use purchase cards to order and pay for work under task orders.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 813920   The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, with the University of California, Davis for sponsorship of the Institute of Transportation Studies.  The institute is sponsored by a unique collaboration of auto manufacturers, energy companies, fuel cell companies, the State of California, and other Federal Agencies.  As a sponsor of the institute, US EPA will participate and share in the information and experiences generated during research conducted on the transition to a hydrogen economy in the U.S..  The primary  focus of the research is the manufacture, storage, and distribution of hydrogen for use in fuel cell vehicles, but non-FC, stationary, and off-road vehicle markets and applications will also be fully considered to the extent they might influence hydrogen infrastructure investments.  The University  of California, Davis is the administrator of the Institute of Transportation Studies.  Sponsorship will allow EPA access to key national stakeholders in the hydrogen fuel cell dialog, participation by EPA staff on working group teams, early access to non-proprietary data, reports, and documents  prepared and released by ITS-Davis, access to site visits, tours, demonstrations, and participation in hydrogen fuel cell marketing, public awareness, communications, and education outreach programs and products.  The EPA believes that the University of California, Davis is the only firm able to  provide access to the Institute of Transportation Studies and provide a forum with auto manufacturers, energy companies, fuel cell companies, the State of California and other Federal Agencies to discuss research on the manufacture, storage, and distribution of hydrogen for use in fuel cell  vehicles.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS.  However, any firm believing itself capable of providing the required access to the research conducted by ITS-Davis may submit appropriate documentation to establish the potential of delivering the research.  Such  documentation must be submitted to the POC within 15 days of electronic posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses received will normally be considered solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be  considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  Documentation should be submitted in writing to Scott Tharp via Fax (513) 487-2109 or email Tharp.Scott@epa.gov.  Telephone responses will not be honored.  See Note  26.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION SYNOPSIS FOR STUDENT LABORATORY SERVICES TO BE HIRED ON A CONTRACT BASIS BY THE US ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY.  The solicitation number is UUX208 (RFQ-RT-04-00420).   EPA's Office of Research and Development is the scientific research arm that designs, conducts, and transfers sound science to a variety of customers within and outside of the EPA.  The National Exposure Research Laboratory (NERL), one of seven components of EPA's Office of Research and Development, is the laboratory that conducts research and development that leads to  improved methods, measurements and models to assess and predict exposures of humans and ecosystems to harmful pollutants and other conditions in air, water, soil, and food.  The communication of science, especially of exposure research, which is a slice of the overall understanding of environmental  processes and protection, is particularly challenging for EPA's scientists and potentially confusing or abstract for various audiences. The NERL's communication and outreach program works with scientists and their managers to identify appropriate venues and audiences for outreach materials.  This  includes press events, meetings and conferences, and recruitment fairs.  Communication and outreach products include one-paged internal fact sheets, biographies on accomplished scientists, brochures about specific research programs, publications in plain English about research findings, slide  presentations to describe the laboratory, and webpages.  The Immediate Office of the Laboratory Director is seeking a student to provide support to NERL in the areas of technical writing and editing, meeting logistics and support, curriculum development, and NERL Image Library.   A first possible  assignment is to develop a set of brief profiles on selected scientists and their research areas based on face-to-face or phone interviews. All technical questions are to be forwarded via email to the Contract Specialist at the following e-mail address:  clausen.rebecca@epa.gov.   Interested  parties should review all material relevant to the requirement by looking under Request for Quotation section of the EPA's website at the following address:  http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd.  These solicitation documents will be posted to that website 15 days after issuance of this pre-solicitation  synopsis.  Interested parties should go to the website and click on the link entitled "Student Services UUX208, RFQ-RT-04-00420" to check the status of this procurement and to ascertain when and if any amendments have been issued.

<DESC>It is the intent of the NAVAIR Orlando Training Systems Division, Orlando, FL to solicit and award a sole source IDIQ contract to Manufacturing Engineering Systems (MES), Inc. (12104-H Indian Creek Court, Beltsville, MD  20705) under statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(b), set forth in FAR 6.302-1 titled, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The Government has a requirement to continue the support for the Anti-submarine Warfare (ASW) training system, device 14A12 for the US and 14A12J for Japan. The following is a brief description of the requirements for the continuous effort of the ASW:
·	Continue with the re-host modification to convert and replace VME- based computers to PCs-based for the remaining systems: OSAC (Ownship Aircraft), CIC (Combat Information Center), Sonar, Bridge and Communication.  
·	Perform Quick Response Modifications (QRM) to ASWC requests. 
·	Perform software/hardware modifications to improve trainer reliability and replace obsolete parts/systems. 
·	Conduct requested integrated logistics support of Device 14A12J ASW Trainer. 
·	Support hardware modifications with appropriate spare/repair parts. 
·	Continue to maintain and update the active Inventory CheckList/Record (ICL/R). 
·	Maintain the integrity of technical and training documentation with updated reports (per JMSDF conference of 6/2000) of new hardware/software modifications.
MES possesses unique qualifications and technical knowledge, as the original developers of the trainer software program and hardware design being used in the 14A12J trainer, for this follow-on effort.  Knowledge of the complexities of the trainer software, enables MES to quickly and efficiently provide repair and modification support without adding cost to research the existing software structure to identify the peculiarities involved in rewriting/changing/upgrading software to modify the trainer for PC use and to keep it in a ready condition. The expense associated with a new contractor having to learn all of the intricacies of the trainer software program would far exceed the authorized budget for this device.  The current effort for this device has been underway in phases over the past several years and the each successive phase builds upon the last one.  A new contractor would have to become familiar with all of the phases to date, in order to fully understand the efforts that remain and to successfully complete those tasks.This sole source award is based on substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to recover through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the customer’s needs. Interested firms may submit their capabilities and qualifications to the identified point of contact not later than 26 August 2004 3: 00 P.M. eastern time. Such capabilities and qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. This is not a request for quotes, and this notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. If you have any questions or concerns please contact: Mr. Jun Ji, Contract Specialist, phone 407-380-4020, fax 407-380-4164, or jun.ji@navy.mil.

<DESC>Notice of intent to negotiate a sole source contract utilizing the acquisition procedures under the authority of FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation, with Nexcom, Inc., 4450 Enterprise Ct., Suite H, Melbourne, FL 32934.  The National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service (NESDIS) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the requirement to procure Solid State S-Band Transmitters RETROFIT and PROTOTYPE systems to replace the existing transmitters.  NESDIS operates the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) from facilities located in Wallops, VA and Fairbanks, AK with a back-up facility located in Greenbelt, MD.  NESDIS is replacing existing Klystron-based S-band transmitters with RETROFIT components and a PROTOTYPE system with a new solid-state amplifier.  In order to assure acceptable performance, the first units will be extensively tested in the operational environment after initial delivery.  After equivalent operation of the RETROFIT and PROTOTYPE systems has been successfully demonstrated, the Government may exercise an OPTION to replace or retrofit the remaining GOES S-band transmitters located at the NESDIS facilities.  The requirements for the project are set forth in the attached Statement of Work for the GOES SOLID STATE S-BAND TRANSMITTER SYSTEM dated August 2004, and Specifications GSD03.001 and GSD03.002, dated August 2004.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 334220 is assigned for this procurement. The small business size standard for NAICS Code 334220 is 750 employees.

The proposed action is for supplies for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1.  The Government conducted “Sources Sought” market research at the Wallops facility during April 2004 which resulted in only one responsible source able to provide this item in a manner that will satisfy the agency requirements within the time and funding constraints imposed.  Nexcom’s approach is to modify their existing product lines, thus avoiding the need for extensive research and development to produce an operational product that meets the requirements. This notice is not a request for competitive quotes but responses received on or before September 27, 2004, 9:00 am EDT will be evaluated.  A determination by the Contracting Officer not to compete this proposed action is based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.  Information received will be considered solely for the proposes of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Please email comments and responses via email to the Contracting Officer at mike.knowles@noaa.gov.  “See Note 22".

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY FOR PLANNING PURPOSES.  
THERE IS NO SOLICITATION DRAWING PACKAGE AVAILABLE.

This is a request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201(e).

The government does not presently intend to award a contract, but wants to obtain information on commercially available products.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  
The Air Expeditionary Force Battlelab (AEFB), Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho, is planning to conduct research that will evaluate commercial options to solve the following problem:  

Currently, there is a need for lightweight, transportable frame used to attach standard 2’x6’ visual landing zone marker panels (orange on one side and purple on the other).  At existing forward operating locations, the system will be used to mark short field landing zones.  The system must be collapsible in case of aircraft strike and must be designed for quick set up and tear down. The attachment points on the panels are brass corner grommets with parachute cord loops.  The specifications for the system are as follows:
1.	Must be transportable in Blackhawk X-1Raptor backpacks with dimensions 16”x13”x20” with optimum fill space of 1’x1’x6”.
2.	Must be compatible with C-17A VAMP system slotted panels.
3.	Must be collapsible in case of aircraft strike.
4.	Must be durable to withstand jet blast.
5.	Stakes cannot be used to hold panel to the ground because of packed gravel with concrete stub (personnel have access to sandbags).
6.	Able to rotate on a hinge point to ensure the ability to flip the panel for opposite wind changes.  This is desired but not required.

The AEFB is interested in Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products that could be used as-is to solve this problem.

The AEFB is seeking the following specific information from industry representatives:
1.	The manufacturers suggested retail price for the commercial product.
2.	The name of distributors who could sell to the Government.
3.	The degree to which the product can meet or exceed the capabilities needed for the above problem.

Requested information must be submitted NO LATER THAN 24 Aug 04 to Capt Dean Ramsett, Air Expeditionary Force Battlelab, 360 Gunfighter Ave, Suite 1, Mountain Home AFB, ID 83648.  Early submittals would be appreciated.  Capt Ramsett can be reached at (208) 828-3546.  A formal solicitation MAY NOT BE ISSUED as a result of this RFI.  Information provided may or may not be included in a formal solicitation.  The USAF will not release any information -- marked with a Proprietary legend -- received in response to this RFI to any firms, agencies, or individuals outside the USAF without written permission in accordance with the legend.

The base bid requirement for HVAC upgrade for 5,100 (+/-) sq.ft. of space remains unchanged as noted in Sections B, C, specifications and drawings.  This change reduces the estimate price range for the project to $250,000 to $500,000 and reduces the time for completion to 210 days after notice to proceed.  Sections F.3 which incorporates clause 52.217-7 and M.2 which incorporates 52.217-5 are deleted in their entirety.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.eps.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line(NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil. While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable. Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command. The purpose of this modification to presolicitation notice N00024-04-R-6121 is to provide answers to questions 1 and 2 regarding the Torpedo Advanced Processor Build (APB) Broad Agency Announcement (BAA).  These answers result in no change to the BAA as posted on 13 July 2004.   The due date for proposals remains unchanged.  The questions and answers are as follows: 1.  QUESTION:  “Please elaborate on the Intellectual Property requirements for the Torpedo APB? Does the Navy want license for use or ownership of the torpedo processing software?" ANSWER:  “The Government desires at least Government Purpose Rights (GPR), as defined by DFARS 252.227-7014(a)(11) entitled RIGHTS IN NONCOMMERCIAL COMPUTER SOFTWARE AND NONCOMMERCIAL COMPUTER SOFTWARE DOCUMENTATION (JUN 1995), in all torpedo processing software deliverables.  The contractor will retain "ownership" (e.g., title) to all computer software deliverables.  The Government intends to require the contractor to deliver all object code, source code, software specification and standards and developer tool kits necessary to enable the Government to modify and upgrade the torpedo processing software, including integrating the software into other torpedo or naval weapons systems." 2.  QUESTION:  “Torpedo BAA solicitation says that “the Navy intends to award up to (3) preliminary Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) studies…”. We are inquiring as to whether a bid submitted on a Time and Material (T&M) basis, rather than on a cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) basis, would be acceptable to the government for this solicitation?" ANSWER:  “Time and Material (T&M) contracts are the least preferred contract type.  Per FAR 16.601(b), a time-and-materials contract may be used only when it is not possible at the time of placing the contract to estimate accurately the extent or duration of the work or to anticipate costs with any reasonable degree of confidence.  Justification that no other contract type is suitable for the acquisition is required in order to use T&M type contracts. Adequate justification does not exist to procure on a T&M basis.  For the Torpedo Advanced Processor Build (APB) Program, the Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) contract type has been identified as the most appropriate.  If the offeror chooses to propose on an other than CPFF basis, there is the risk that the proposal will not be among the most highly rated proposals and therefore not accepted for negotiation or accepted pending the availability of funds.  Additionally, any submission on an other than CPFF basis may be considered non-r! esponsive and not considered for award.”

<CONTACT>Mark Snell, Contract Specialist, Phone (360396-0239, Fax (360)396-0853, Email mark.snell@navy.mil
<DESC>This is a 100% 8(a) set-aside competitive procurement and is open to 8(a) firms only.  The Government intends for the 8(a) Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) vehicle to be awarded as 3 to 5 contracts from a single solicitation.  Resulting 8(a) MACC contracts will be Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ).  The minimum guarantee for each offeror awarded a contract is $15,000.  The $15,000 minimum guarantee will be deducted from the first Task Order awarded to each contractor.  The contract duration consists of a one-year base period and two one-year option periods.  The Not To Exceed (NTE) amount for the life of the overall 8(a) MACC vehicle is $100 Million.  The NTE amount for each contract will be $120 Million divided by the number of contract awardees. Task Orders will be firm fixed price with an award range between $100,000 and $1,500,000.  Note, an additional Large 8(a) MACC will be awarded by the conclusion of Fiscal Year 2004 with a Task Order award range of $1,000,000 to $6,000,000.  Offerors can submit proposals for both MACC vehicles.  
	Task Orders will consist of new construction, renovation, alteration, demolition, and repair work, including any necessary design.  Task Orders may include the following types of scopes of work: design-build, 100% design, performance-based, or a combination thereof.  Projects will potentially be located at various locations serviced by Engineering Field Activity Northwest (EFA NW) including Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, and Alaska, but primarily Washington State.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 236; Construction of Buildings. The applicable size standard is $28.5M.  Representative types of projects for NAICS 236 include, but are not limited to: administrative and industrial facilities, housing renovation, childcare centers, lodges, recreation/fitness centers, retail complexes, warehouses, housing offices, community centers, commercial and institutional buildings, manufacturing and industrial buildings and other similar facilities.
     Award will be based on a tradeoff (best value) source selection, considering evaluation factors that will be identified in the solicitation.  At time of award the highest rated offeror will receive the seed project and the next most highly ranked offerors selected for contract award will receive the minimum guarantee.  The Government intends to evaluate MACC proposals and award contract(s) without discussions.  Therefore, each initial proposal should contain the offeror’s best terms from a technical and cost or price standpoint.  Offerors should not assume they would be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposal.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if determined to be in the best interests of the Government.         
     The Government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or the actual amount of work to be ordered. Contract awardees are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee.  Task Order evaluation factors will vary depending on the unique requirements for each Task Order and may be competed on the basis of price, trade-off analysis (best value), or low price technically acceptable.  Each awardee shall be provided a fair opportunity to be considered for each Task Order award, except under those circumstances described in FAR 16.505.     
     THE SOLICITATION WILL BE OFFERED IN ELECTRONIC FORMAT ONLY.  NO HARD COPIES WILL BE PROVIDED.  The solicitation package, including plans and specifications will be posted on the NAVFAC electronic solicitation website http://esol.navfac.navy.mil.  It is the offeror’s responsibility to check the web site for any updates to the status of the solicitation or other notices.  The only plan-holder list available is via the ESOL website under this solicitation number.  Prospective offerors MUST register themselves on the website.  The response time set by FAR 5.203 will begin on the date of issuance of the solicitation.  The solicitation will be posted on or about September 15, 2004.  The estimated period of proposal preparation will be 30 days.  The e-mail address for inquiries is: mark.snell@navy.mil.

THIS AMENDMENT IS ISSUED TO PROVIDE EPA'S RESPONSES TO VENDOR'S QUESTIONS AND TO DELETE ONE CLAUSE INCLUDED BY REFERENCE.  EPA RESPONSES CAN BE DOWNLOADED FROM http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd.  Firms are  encouraged to access the request for quotation, provisions and amendments via the internet. If you will obtaining a copy of the request for quotation via the Internet, it will by your responsibility to frequently check the same site where the request for quotation is posted for any amendments.  In  the list of additional FAR clauses cited which are applicable to this solicitation, FAR clause 52.225-3, Buy American Act--North American Free Trace Agreement is deleted; this action is a total small business set aside. Several question have been received in regards to solicitation No.  RFQ-RT-04-00322, 9KW DC Photovoltaic Panel Electric Power Generating System.  The questions are 1.  Is the structural design of the penthouse and the main building capable of withstanding the additional weight of the proposed solar system?  2.  Does the roof membrane have a warranty involved and if  so does the company issuing the warranty need to make the roof membrane penetration.  3.  Due to string sizing considerations and so forth it is impractical to achieve exactly 9 kW of PV.  How close is close enough and would it be preferable to size a little under or over 9 kW?  4. With 9 kW of PV  why spec in a 12 kW inverter capacity?  Is the idea to later expand the PV arrays?  5. How do we obtain a copy of provision 52.212-3?  The answers are:  The load bearing capacity of the penthouse roof is 200+ lbs/sq ft.  While the roof is still under a material warranty, the contractor for this  project will do all roof penetrations although it is possible to ballast the panels and not have any roof penetrations. Also, we are striving for 9KW.  Slightly more is not a problem, but we would have to review what you consider slightly less. And yes, the plan is to expand to 12 KW in the future  if funding becomes available. The deadline for submission of quotes is not extended..

<DESC>Notice of intent to negotiate a sole source contract utilizing the acquisition procedures under the authority of FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation, with Nexcom, Inc., 4450 Enterprise Ct., Suite H, Melbourne, FL 32934.  The National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service (NESDIS) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has the requirement to procure Solid State S-Band Transmitters RETROFIT and PROTOTYPE systems to replace the existing transmitters.  NESDIS operates the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) from facilities located in Wallops, VA and Fairbanks, AK with a back-up facility located in Greenbelt, MD.  NESDIS is replacing existing Klystron-based S-band transmitters with RETROFIT components and a PROTOTYPE system with a new solid-state amplifier.  In order to assure acceptable performance, the first units will be extensively tested in the operational environment after initial delivery.  After equivalent operation of the RETROFIT and PROTOTYPE systems has been successfully demonstrated, the Government may exercise an OPTION to replace or retrofit the remaining GOES S-band transmitters located at the NESDIS facilities.  The requirements for the project are set forth in the Statement of Work for the GOES SOLID STATE S-BAND TRANSMITTER SYSTEM dated August 2004, and Specifications GSD03.001 and GSD03.002, dated August 2004, available upon request.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 334220 is assigned for this procurement. The small business size standard for NAICS Code 334220 is 750 employees.

The proposed action is for supplies for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1.  The Government conducted “Sources Sought” market research at the Wallops facility during April 2004 which resulted in only one responsible source able to provide this item in a manner that will satisfy the agency requirements within the time and funding constraints imposed.  Nexcom’s approach is to modify their existing product lines, thus avoiding the need for extensive research and development to produce an operational product that meets the requirements. This notice is not a request for competitive quotes but responses received on or before September 27, 2004, 9:00 am EDT will be evaluated.  A determination by the Contracting Officer not to compete this proposed action is based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.  Information received will be considered solely for the proposes of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Please email comments and responses via email to the Contracting Officer at mike.knowles@noaa.gov.  “See Note 22".

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled Human & Robotic Technology which was posted on June 29, 2004. You are notified that the following changes are made: Posting of additional Questions and Answers. The due date for response is not extended. Documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/HQ Business Opportunities home page is http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=04  Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation and any amendments.   Potential offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any). A link to briefing charts and further datails is located at: https://naccsli1.msfc.nasa.gov/ExplorationPortal I.  Questions/Answers, cont'd Q57.	I’m ready to submit an NOI to the H&RT BAA but I’m confused as to what NASA is looking for under the headings of “Phase I Deliverables” and “Phase II Deliverables.”  What is NASA looking for here?	 Likewise, I’m confused as to how a proposer is to select “Secondary” project type.  If a proposer is doing ASTP proposals, is the “secondary” a compatible program in TMP into which a proposer would hope to propose follow-on work at the conclusion of the ASTP work? A57.	Proposers should indicate deliverables as described in section C-2 of the BAA. The identification of secondary project types is required to facilitate the assigning of the appropriate evaluators.  The secondary project types can point to compatible projects working with either more mature technologies or less mature technologies. Q58.	Intellectual property has been transferred to a university spin-out company which will act as the BAA project partner, i.e. performing a sub-contracting R&D role to who will perform the majority of work.  As the spin-out is based in the United Kingdom, does NASA envisage any problems with it acting in this capacity, i.e. probably undertaking around 15% of the budgeted work?  Does NASA feel it might jeopardize the approval of the project in any way, or would the proposer be advised to establish a U.S. company instead. A58.	This is only an intellectual property issue to the extent inventive activity is performed in the UK. Q59.	On page 2 of the BAA it states: “This BAA solicits research and technology development proposals from NASA investigators in support of……..”, has this statement been included in error? A59.	The statement has been amended to read:  “This BAA solicits research and technology development proposals from external NASA investigators in support of the following H&RT Programs”. Q60.	Appendix C of the BAA seems to have been written for the internal NASA BAA.  For instance, in section 2 under the Lead Individual it states “Name of Other Relevant NASA Personal”.  Is there an NOI specifically for the external BAA? A60.	This NOI applies to the external BAA.  Part 1-3 requires you to list the Key individuals that are not NASA, and Part 2a requires you to provide the summaries of all the key individuals, including your NASA partners. Q61.	Will any system design tools that support these technology activities be measured on a similar TRL schedule? A61.	No, system design tools will not be measured on a similar TRL scale, Reference Section VIII.5 of the BAA.  It is not NASA’s intention to change the scope of the BAA in answering this question. Q62.	Is there an expectation of discussing the commercialization potential of these tools in these proposals similar to the way SBIRs technology solicitations are crafted? A62.	The detailed goals and objectives that are applicable to SBIR are somewhat different than the overall H&RT portfolio.  The H&RT formulation plan outlines overarching goals and objectives that promote sound technology investments that will allow NASA to pursue its exploration vision, and at the same time have a sound positive impact to the U.S. economy. Q63.	In responding to the cost portion of the proposal, is NASA looking for a tight range or within plus minus 10 percent and is it sufficient to say that it is within range of what is proposed? A63.	NASA is looking for a range on the white paper.  On the final proposal, NASA is expecting a proposers full proposal would be the basis for the contract and expect a proposer to have full confidence in that number.   Q64.	International participation:  The BAA says that “foreign participation will be on a ‘no –exchange-funds’ basis” but you have announced a ‘direct funding waiver’.  Please Clarify? A64.	See section 2.3 of the BAA, a proposer can request for funding or have a sponsoring government provide the funding.  Q65.	Page 37 of the pre-proposal conference slides mentions contracts and cooperative agreements, is the BAA open to grants?  A65.	This BAA is only open to contracts and cooperative agreements. Q66.	In regards to the proposal outline, if a proposer is already a small business does the section for small business goals still apply? A66.	A small business plan will not be required but NASA would like a company to identify any small business partners. Q67.	The proposal outline has small business percentage goals; does this imply in each award that a company will have to have a small business partner? A67.	A proposer who is a large business will have a subcontracting plan and will have goals to meet during the contract as a percent of the contract value.   Q68.	It seems that NASA can fund foreign companies directly.  What is the process for a U.S. prime and foreign sub-contractor?  A68.	The same rules apply, whether it is a prime or a sub. Q69.	Considering small business goals, if for example a proposal had 10 percent participation and one of the four categories is not met is that considered non compliant. A69.	NASA expects that all goals are met and a proposer would get a weakness in the evaluation to the extent that the proposer didn’t meet some of the goals.  However, it is not a go/no go deficiency were a proposer is not eligible for award. Q70.	Are NOIs protected as proprietary information and will they ever be made public? A70.	The NOIs are protected like a proposal and they will not be released to the public. Q71.	How can small businesses announce their capability and intent to team up with the BAA participants? A71.	Contact the H&RT pre-proposal attendees listed on NASA’s website http://exploration.nasa.gov. Q72.	Does the anticipated contract value ranges include the Government Task Agreements and will GTAs be funded through the contract?   A72.	The GTA is part of the project cost and will be captured in the GTA.  The money will stay internal to NASA and flow to the centers directly. Q73.	How many past performance contracts need to be listed, especially in the NOI? A73.	The H&RT BAA doesn’t specify for NOIs but does for full proposals, see section III.C.11 of the BAA. Q74.	Is there a list of the H&RT pre-proposal attendees with contact information available to promote collaboration?  A74.	Yes, a list of attendees is posted on NASA’s web site http://exploration.nasa.gov Q75.	The Industry Day presentation showed four categories under the TMP (page 38), while the BAA appears to have three TMP Categories (page19/20).  It appears that the category for small ($2-4M) design and definition studies has been deleted or at least merged with the infrastructure/carrier definition studies.  Is it the correct interpretation that $2-4M TFE design studies are only related to development of key infrastructures and carriers? A75.	TFE design studies are not just related to development of key infrastructures and carriers, see BAA definition located on Appendix A-21. Q76.	At Industry Day a clear description was given of how NASA partner funding should be included in the cost of the proposal.  Is the small business goal of ten percent, the total cost of the proposal or of the total minus the NASA center funding? A76.	The small business goal of ten percent applies to the total contract value.

<DESC>This amendment modifies a sources sought synopsis (W911QX-RFI-04-0001) previously published on 29 Jul 04 to include the following specific application information for the power source:  Soldier power: 20W-30W sources for powering solider systems. Dis mounted soldier: nominally 8-20W (average power load) for 72 hour operations, need solutions to reduce/eliminate requirements for battery resupply.   Sensor systems (with and without communications) 20-100W, for remote and/or semi-fixed sites, need solutio ns to reduce/eliminate requirements for resupply and/or auxiliary power.  Battery charging: 250W - 500W portable battery charger, carried by squad size unit.  Auxiliary power: portable/ transportable, ~500W(+) silent power for shelters, C4ISR, powering bat tery chargers, etc.  Voltage requirement(s) should be compatible with rechargeable batteries BB2590 (24V nominal).  To clarify the requirement of the T&E procedures for units that are 'presently fully-engineered and packaged or will be in such a state by 1  October 2004', it is the Government's intent to seek for evaluation any developmental items meeting the criteria that would be complete, readily available and factory tested etc. by 1 October 2004 (i.e. the Government is not seeking a 'crash' new developm ent.)

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.eps.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command.  The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division is searching for available sources that can produce Night Vision Imaging System (NVIS) compatible military rugged displays that meet stringent environmental and performance requirements.  The NAVY currently produces a 15-inch transflective and NVIS compatible display that includes silicone bezel button control of external applications.  The display does not include an internal computer for the applications, but does interface with a custom external c! omputer.  The NAVY is interested in acquiring additional sized displays including 10-inch, 8-inch, and possibly other smaller size displays - all based on the current 15-inch design.  As currently developed and designed, the U.S. NAVY has broken-down the display production into several parts:  LCD CORE - The first part of the display is the internal “LCD CORE” chassis assembly that includes the LCD panel glass, filters, AR coated sacrificial glass, lamination, multi-color (NIGHT MODE) NVIS filtered backlights, (DAY MODE) backlights, On Screen Display (OSD) interface, custom control function interfaces (interfaces with enclosure microcontroller), and automatic heaters to maintain somewhat consistent bulb output.  This assembly can be easily removed from the DISPLAY HOUSING (as one unit) and replaced if necessary; DISPLAY HOUSING - The second part of the display is the “DISPLAY HOUSING” that houses the LCD CORE chassis assembly and protects it from the elements and includes th! e power supplies and other electronics necessary to power and control the LCD CORE.  The DISPLAY HOUSING also includes a custom microcontroller with 2-way RS-232 serial communications that interfaces with external software applications, custom microcontroller that interfaces with onboard display bezel buttons and LCD CORE/OSD functions, provides easy removal and replacement of the LCD CORE, includes a custom silicone bezel button assembly module that can be removed and replaced from the enclosure face, custom dimming for day/night mode bulb operation, and other custom functions.  This term also implies that a LCD CORE will be received and installed into the DISPLAY HOUSING, assembled and tested to meet functional and performance requirements, and the entire display delivered to the Government ready to install; COMPLETE DISPLAY - The complete display is defined as having both the LCD CORE and DISPLAY HOUSING delivered as a complete unit.  This term also implies that the entir! e display has been assembled and tested to meet functional and performance requirements and the entire display delivered to the Government ready to install.  NSWC Dahlgren is interested in responses from contractors who have the capability to produce the LCD Core, Display Housing, and Complete Displays.  It is anticipated that there will be a requirement for a minimum quantity of fifteen units (plus spares) for the 15-inch display annually.  Delivery of the LCD Core or Display Housing could range from thirty (30) to sixty (60) days after award or sooner depending on Navy schedules.  Delivery of the Complete Displays could range from thirty (30) to one hundred and twenty (120) days  after award or sooner depending on Navy schedules.  The contractor must have the necessary resources available to design and produce any industry-common and available size LCD display (15-inch currently produced, 10-inch, 8-inch, and other smaller displays may be required by the Government in the ! future).  The display must include, but not be limited to the following environmental requirements:  Must survive and operate as expected for six-hours at +55 Deg. C ambient temperature and in direct full sunlight, while mounted in an open-cockpit vehicle dashboard.  The display must survive -20 Deg. C indefinitely and be fully operational with a design goal of -40 Deg. C operational; Warm-up time from -20 C to operational must not exceed 5 minutes.  Warm-up time from -40 C to operational must not exceed 15 minutes; Shall be built to the IP67 specification for water submersion (1 meter for 30 minutes) and dust intrusion and able to withstand harsh environments to include: salt water, high humidity, sand, rain, "fire hose" wash down, and fungus; Shall be packaged to endure the boat/vehicle environment.  Unpredictable and violent vehicle/craft motions are expected to include high shock and vibration as experienced by small high-speed watercraft operating in heavy surf.  Shocks!  in excess of 30 Gs are common; Shall be fully mission-capable in all weather conditions commonly experienced in worldwide, open-ocean environments and land-based operations; and May be subjected to biological and chemical contamination and shall be capable of standard DOD decontamination procedures and agents. The display must include, but not be limited to the following functional requirements:  Windows 2000 or above operating system compatible and have analog (RGB 5-wire) XGA resolution or better.  With Navy approval, smaller displays could have SVGA resolution or better; Must be easily readable in direct sunlight and overcast conditions (in between light conditions).  Due to the direct sunlight exposure, solar loading must be taken into consideration; The goal is to design and build the displays as small and lightweight as possible and fit into existing dimensional constraints;  Must be compatible with Generation III, Generation IV, and future Night Vision Goggles; Must ! limit glare of direct sunlight reflection on the cover glass viewing surface, while allowing the user to view most of the display screen-even during direct sunlight reflection; The sacrificial cover glass shall be made of impact-resistant glass material that will not cause glass shards to propel toward or endanger operational personnel if broken during vehicle stationary or moving operations; The display cover glass must incorporate contrast filtered enhancements and other necessary filters laminated to the raw LCD panel face to limit internal display reflectance; Must have the ability of OFF/ON power and full-range brightness dimming operation via front pushbutton controls; Input voltage range: 18VDC to 32VDC (currently 24VDC nominal battery source).  The display must be built to MIL-STD-461E requirements for conducted and radiated emissions to limit hazards to ordnance, fuel, and personnel; the display enclosure shall be made of Aluminum.  Finish for the display case will ! be MIL-C-5541E, Class III for shield continuation throughout the case/gasket contact areas, then coat remaining surfaces using MIL-A-8625F, Type II, Class II Black anodizing unless otherwise specified or approved; The display enclosure shall be designed to allow for newer panels to replace older and obsolete panels with minimal impact when modifying the design; Shall be designed such that it can be capable of field/bench repair and all components modularized for easy removal and replacement; Must have a service life of at least 20,000 hours; and Power/heat consumption/generation must be limited to a minimum, using reasonable conservation practice and design.  The display must draw the minimum power necessary-preferably not to exceed 3A at 24VDC (without heaters energized).  It is requested that qualified sources submit a capability statement to NSWC Dahlgren to include the following information:  1.  Previous experience gained from former jobs producing custom military displ! ays, 2. References from former customers, including any information on deployed products, 3. Capability and availability to design and produce custom military displays in short notice, 4. Resources available, including information on staff talent and external resources, 5. Quality assurance and testing procedures used prior to delivery of custom military displays, and 6. Ability to meet delivery schedules.  Capability Statements are limited to ten (10) pages and shall be submitted either via email to XDS11@nswc.navy.mil or in writing to:  Contracting Officer, Attn:  XDS116/Bldg 183/Room 102, NAVSURFWARCEN Dahlgren Division, 17320 Dahlgren Road, Dahlgren, VA  22448-5100.  Responses shall be submitted by 25 August 2004 and identify number N00178-04-Q-1060.  Contractors are reminded that this is a sources sought synopsis only.  This synopsis should not be construed as a commitment or authorization to incur costs in anticipation of a resultant contract.

<DESC>Sources Sought.  The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) intend to acquire the following items for the Hollings Marine Laboratory (HML) in Charleston, SC:  1 each, DeCyder, Personal Computer (PC) and single user license, part number 18116305; 1 each Ettan Spot Picker, part number 18114528.  The DeCyder software must be compatible with the Typhoon imager and allow detection of as little as 0.5 ng of protein per spot. The software must be able to image 2 samples, with an additional internal control sample for normalization between runs in a single slab gel. The “front” and “back” end of Amershams 2D gel system already exists at HML. To add the Decyder imaging software will ensure complete compatibility throughout the experimental run, will increase detections sensitivity and will reduce time and cost that otherwise would have to be invested to match the 2nd dimension to another standard. The Ettan Spot Picker must be compatible with the Amersham 2D-DIGE system and be able to pick spots of low concentration with high accuracy. The software must be capable of imaging 2 samples, with an additional internal control sample for normalization between runs in a single slab gel. HML currently has the instrumentation for the Amersham 2D gel system. To add the Ettan Spot Picker will ensure complete compatibility from sample extraction to protein sequence, and will reduce time and cost that otherwise would have had to be invested to match the separate steps to different standards.  The intended acquisition is for supplies for which the Government intends to acquire from one source under the authority of 41 USC 235(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source. The only known source is Amersham Biosciences Corporation, Piscataway, NJ. Amersham is the only vendor that provides a software to read two experimental samples and a normalization control on the same gel using fluorescent labeling of the proteins, and that provides a protein spot picker that is compatible with the existing instrumentation at HML.  This is not a request for proposals and there is no solicitation available at this time. The Government reserves the right to solicit bids based on receipt of affirmative responses to this notice or issue a contract to Amersham Biosciences Corporation, whichever is determined to be more advantageous to the Government, without further notice.

<DESC>DESC:  The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), in conjunction with the Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (ACSIM), Army Material Command and Red River Army Depot, Texas, seek to identify responsible potential sources and obtain information in regards to possible privatization of utility systems in accordance with 10 USC 2688, "Utility Systems: Conveyance Authority" for Utility Privatization of the Natural Gas Distribution System at Red River Army Depot, Texas.  The potential privatization action will include transfer of ownership, operation and maintenance, and the obligation to serve.  The Army will not transfer ownership of land or any land lease interest for Red River Army Depot, TX and will grant easements and leases, with concurrence of the underlying leaseholder where applicable, for access to land associated with each utility system.  
 
OBJECTIVE:  Should privatization occur, the ownership of the Natural Gas Distribution System and equipment to include, all capital investments, operation, maintenance and repair responsibilities, shall transfer to a publicly or privately owned utility provider.  All responsibility for maintaining reliable service, including such items as environmental compliance, operation, maintenance, major systems renovation, construction, equipment, manpower and overhead shall be the responsibility of the new owner.  Utility services under the potential contract will not include the commodity itself.  
 
INSTALLATION AND UTILITY SYSTEM DESCRIPTION:
 
Note:	(1). All technical data and information listed below is to be considered either an estimated quantity or an approximate order of magnitude.  Companies responding to this notice of interest are responsible for verification of all inventory data.
 
(2). Companies responding to this notice of interest shall respond to interest in the entire scope of the requirement.
 
The Red River Army Depot is located in Central Bowie County, near Texarkana, Texas.

INSTALLATION DESCRIPTION:

Red River Army Depot (RRAD, Red River or the Installation) is an U.S. Army Installation located in Central Bowie County, near Texarkana, Texas. Established in 1941, the Installation was initially designated Red River Ordnance Depot. The Installation was combined with the adjacent Lone Star Ordnance Plant in 1943 and the two installations were called the Texarkana Ordnance Center. In 1945 the two installations were designated Red River Arsenal and then once again became Red River Ordnance Depot (1961). The two installations were separated again in 1962 and this installation became Red River Army Depot consists of 19,081 acres, 3 million square feet of covered storage, and 2.9 million square feet of outdoor storage. Its primary responsibility is the rebuild/reconfiguration of the Bradley Fighting Vehicle System including storage, maintenance and demilitarization of ammunition and missiles. Today RRAD operates as a Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Installation. A portion of the Installation was determined to be in excess of the Army’s requirement and as such, a portion of RRAD was BRAC’d or transferred to the local Re-use Authority. Today, the BRAC’d area is active and operated by the Red River Re-Use Authority (RRRA).

Description of Facilities:  The utility systems consists of the following Capital assets:

A. Natural Gas Distribution System Description
The RRAD natural gas distribution system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to the distribution system from the point in which the distribution system enters the Installation, and/or Government ownership currently starts, to the point of demarcation as defined by the real estate instruments. Generally, the point of demarcation will be the building footprint. The system may include, but is not limited to, pipelines, valves, regulators, and meters. The following description and inventory is included to provide the Offeror with a general understanding of the size and configuration of the distribution system. The Offeror shall base the proposal on site inspections, information in the technical library, other pertinent information, and to a lesser degree, the description following in subsequent paragraphs. Under no circumstances shall the Offeror be entitled to any rate adjustments based on the accuracy of the following description and inventory.
The Installation’s existing natural gas distribution system includes approximately 97,638 linear feet of medium and high-density polyethylene, steel, and coated and wrapped steel pipe, 34 main valves, 83 industrial services and 27 residential services. The distribution mains range in size from less than 2 inches to 6 inches in diameter. There are high and low pressure lines that make up the distribution system. Low pressure is approximately 20-25 psi and the high pressure is approximately 50-60 psi. The entire distribution system at RRAD is owned, operated and maintained by the Government. This includes the section of the distribution system located within the BRAC area.

According to Installation personnel and as observed from the inventory, approximately 71 percent of the RRAD natural gas distribution system has been replaced or upgraded to polyethylene pipe since 1970. However, some of the original pipeline (installed in 1943) is still in service. The remaining steel and coated and wrapped steel pipe receives no cathodic protection or checks annually. Overall, the system is considered to be in good to excellent condition as rated by the Installation personnel.

Several conditions exist that may effect the ownership and operation of RRAD’s natural gas utility system. Some of these conditions include: radio frequency use limitations, special security concerns, non-government operations and tenants and utilities located inside blast perimeters.

The Contractor shall comply with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations governing the operation of the Natural Gas Distribution System.
REQUIREMENTS:  The general goal of the privatization process at Red River is to transfer all Capital assets of the Natural Gas Distribution System to a municipal, private, regional, district or cooperative utility company or other non-Department of Defense entity to own and operate the systems on a long term contractual basis. Specific requirements under the contract will be: (1) the ability to service all areas within Red River Army Depot and all Federal service premises currently served by Government owned systems that are the subject of this requirement.
PROCESS:  This request is to gather information from interested parties and is an essential step in determining market interest for the privatization of the Natural Gas Distribution System at Red River Army Depot.  In order to minimize costs both to potentially interested parties and the government, this notice is issued to determine market interest and feasibility as well as determining marketing strategies for privatizing the utility system.  Should insufficient credible interest be identified for a privatization action, it is highly likely that no formal solicitation will be issued.  Should interest be determined sufficient, a formal Request for Proposals (RFP) may be forthcoming. Interested parties should provide a statement of interest on company letterhead.  The statement of interest must not exceed a total length of 15 pages. The statement shall include as a minimum, the following information:  (1) Capability and experience in the ownership, operation and maintenance of similar systems; (2) financial Capability to purchase, upgrade, expand, operate and maintain the utility system; (3) conceptual rate plan (i.e., will charges for utility service be made from existing rates or from rates developed specifically for service at the individual installation(s); (4) discussion of your conceptual basis for a proposed purchase price (Capitalized earnings value, replacement cost new less depreciation, original cost less depreciation, or other); (5) understanding of the federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations and familiarity and experience with environmental compliance procedures and regulations for the State of Texas and US Environmental Protection Agency Regions; (6) Company point of contact, phone number, and e-mail address.
 
SITE VISIT AND DATA:  Neither a site visit nor the provision of additional data on the utility systems is considered necessary for the preparation and submittal of statement of interest.  If a site visit and the provision of additional data are later determined necessary, notification will be provided by way of an amendment to this announcement.  
 
DUE DATE:  Statements of interest must be submitted to Defense Energy Support Center (DESC-EC) by 3:00 P.M., Eastern Standard Time on Friday, August 27, 2004.  Sources may address responses to:  Defense Energy Support Center, 8725 John J. Kingman Rd., Room 3830, ATTN:  Mily Le or Christine Bond-Jawish, DESC-EC, Ft. Belvoir, VA  22060-6222.

The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Marketing Service’s National Organic Program (NOP) is seeking sources for qualified businesses to provide technical reviews of substances petitioned for evaluation for inclusion on or removal from the National List of Substances Allowed and Prohibited in Organic Production and Handling.  Technical reviews may require expertise in agricultural production, handling, or processing or in scientific disciplines such as veterinary medicine, chemistry, food technology, microbiology, or toxicology.  

Frequently asked questions about the National Organic Program, the standard of proof and methodology for reviews are:  

1.) What is the National Organic Program?  

The program was established on December 21, 2000, under the authority of the Organic Foods Production Act of 1990 (OFPA) (7 U.S.C. 6501 et seq.), as amended.  The mission of the NOP is to develop, implement, and enforce national standards for the production, handling, and marketing of organically produced agricultural products.  The NOP regulations (7 CFR 205 et seq.), including an initial list (National List) of synthetic substances that may be used and nonsynthetic substances that may not be used in organic crop and livestock production, and synthetic and nonsynthetic substances that may be used in organic handling, were fully implemented on October 21, 2002.  OFPA defines a synthetic substance as “a substance that is formulated or manufactured by a chemical process or by a process that chemically changes a substance extracted from naturally occurring plant, animal, or mineral sources, except that such term shall not apply to substances created by naturally occurring biological processes.”  Non-synthetic substances are all substances not meeting OFPA’s definition of a synthetic substance. OFPA provides that persons may petition the National Organic Standards Board (NOSB) to evaluate a substance for inclusion on or removal from the National List.  OFPA authorizes the NOSB to develop and forward recommendations to the Secretary of Agriculture on proposed amendments to the National List.  OFPA authorizes the convening of TAPs to provide scientific evaluation of the substances considered for inclusion on or removal from the National List.  The results of the TAP evaluations are used by the NOSB in making their recommendations to the Secretary.  

2.) What Specific Tasks Will the Contractor Perform?  

In general, the contractor will address a petitioned substance’s potential for adverse impacts on human health or the environment and its essentiality in organic operations.  The contractor’s responses to these evaluation questions will be used by the NOSB in determining the compatibility of pesticides, animal drugs, and food additives approved under the statutory and regulatory authority of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with organic production and handling.  
	
3.) What is the Standard of Proof in Answering the Evaluation Questions?  

Most of the petitioned substances will be pesticides, animal drugs, and food additives regulated by the EPA and/or FDA.  The EPA and FDA review and approval processes, address all human, animal, and environmental risk factors through risk assessment protocols that include hazard identifications, hazard characterizations, exposure assessments, and risk characterizations.  For example, before registering a new pesticide or new use for a registered pesticide, EPA must first ensure that the pesticide, when used according to label directions, can be used with a reasonable certainty of no harm to human health and without posing unreasonable risks to the environment.  Similarly, under the FDA’s New Animal Drug Evaluation process, the new animal drug must be clinically tested for effectiveness and safety.  If a product is intended for use in a food-producing animal, it must also be tested for safety to human consumers, and the edible animal products must be free of unsafe drug residues.  Additionally, the FDA must review the safety of food and color additives before manufacturers and distributors can market them.  To initiate this review, sponsors are required to submit a petition or notification that includes appropriate test data to demonstrate the safety of the intended use of the substance.  Finally, each of these review processes reflects the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA).  The NEPA requires each Federal agency to assess, as an integral part of its decision making process, the environmental impacts of its actions and to ensure that the interested and affected public is informed of its environmental analyses. Therefore, the contractor should use, as a basis for responding to the evaluation questions, data from the petitioned substance’s original review and approval process under the statutory and regulatory authority of the EPA and the FDA as well as any subsequent data obtained through a review of widely recognized, first-tier, peer-reviewed scientific journals addressing human health, environment, nutrition, and conventional or organic agriculture production and handling.  The contractor should ensure that all data sources used in preparing responses to the evaluation questions would be deemed trustworthy, reliable, and competent if contested in a legal or judicial proceeding.  Any response to the questions by the contractor should reflect the conclusions reached in the majority of the literature reviewed.  When the literature reviewed by the contractor is inconclusive, the contractor may provide a response to the evaluation questions based on an abundance of caution.  In doing so, the contractor should clearly state his/her rationale for the abundance of caution response. 
To assist the contractor, the NOP will arrange with the National Agricultural Library for literature searches to be performed at no cost to the contractor.  This action should enhance the contractor’s ability to perform literature searches of widely recognized, first-tier, peer-reviewed scientific journals on an as needed basis. Please provide responses to this notice no later than 23 August 2004.

The A2C2S includes a UH-60L (and newer models) Black Hawk Helicopter integrated with both an A-Kit and a B-Kit.  The A-Kit is permanently affixed to the airframe and consists of the antennas, wiring, and aircraft interfaces (power, structural,etc.) to enab le the B-Kit to be installed in the host platform.  Once the A-Kit is installed, the airframe is designated the EUH-60.  The B-Kit(also referred to as the Maneuver Commander's Environment and as the AN/ASC-38) consists of operator positions/workstations, c omputer systems, and necessary communications devices to host and support the data Command and Control (C2)process.  The A2C2S allows the commander and his staff to maintain voice and digital connectivity with required C2 elements.  The A2C2S roughly repli cates the digital capabilities of the maneuver brigade commander's Tactical Command Post (TACCP).  It provides the maneuver commander a rapidly depoyable means of C2 that can support any mission.  The A2C2S hosts the following GFE Army Battle Command Syste m (ABCS)Battlefield Automation System (BAS) Software: a)Maneuver Control System (MCS);b)All-Source Analysis System(ASAS)-Remote Work Station (RWS);c)Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS);d)Force XXI Battle Command Brigade and Below (FBCB2) Embedded Battle Command (EBC) Tactical Operations Center (TOC) Server;e)Integrated System Control(ISYSCON)Tactical Internet Manager (TIM);f)The FBCB2(Non-EBC TOC Server Version)necessary to implement/execute TIM;g)Air and Missile Defense Work Station (AMDW S);h) Combat Service Support Control System (CSSCS); and i)Global Command and Control System-Army (GCCS-A)(Client Viewer).

<SUBJECT>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) TORPEDO ADVANCED PROCESSOR BUILD (APB) UPDATE #2
<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.eps.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line(NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil. While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable. Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command. This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) was originally posted in the Special Notices section on 24 June 2004 and was updated on 13 July 2004.  The purpose of this update, Update #2, is to provide answers to questions 1 and 2 regarding the Torpedo Advanced Processor Build (APB) BAA.  These answers result in no change to the BAA as posted on 13 July 2004.   The due date for proposals remains unchanged.  The questions and answers are as follows: 1.  QUESTION:  “Please elaborate on the Intellectual Property requirements for the Torpedo APB? Does the Navy want license for use or ownership of the torpedo processing software?" ANSWER:  “The Government desires at least Government Purpose Rights (GPR), as defined by DFARS 252.227-7014(a)(11) entitled RIGHTS IN NONCOMMERCIAL COMPUTER SOFTWARE AND NONCOMMERCIAL COMPUTER SOFTWARE DOCUMENTATION (JUN 1995), in all torpedo processing software deliverables.  The contractor will retain "ownership" (e.g., title) to all computer software deliverables.  The Government intends to require the contractor to deliver all object code, source code, software specification and standards and developer tool kits necessary to enable the Government to modify and upgrade the torpedo processing software, including integrating the software into other torpedo or naval weapons systems." 2.  QUESTION:  “Torpedo BAA solicitation says that “the Navy intends to award up to (3) preliminary Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) studies…”. We are inquiring as to whether a bid submitted on a Time and Material (T&M) basis, rather than on a cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) basis, would be acceptable to the government for this solicitation?” ANSWER:  “Time and Material (T&M) contracts are the least preferred contract type.  Per FAR 16.601(b), a time-and-materials contract may be used only when it is not possible at the time of placing the contract to estimate accurately the extent or duration of the work or to anticipate costs with any reasonable degree of confidence.  Justification that no other contract type is suitable for the acquisition is required in order to use T&M type contracts. Adequate justification does not exist to procure on a T&M basis.  For the Torpedo Advanced Processor Build (APB) Program, the Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) contract type has been identified as the most appropriate.  If the offeror chooses to propose on an other than CPFF basis, there is the risk that the proposal will not be among the most highly rated proposals and therefore not accepted for negotiation or accepted pending the availability of funds.  Additionally, any submission on an other than CPFF basis may be considered non-r! esponsive and not considered for award.” FOR CONVENIENCE, THE ENTIRE BAA POSTING OF 13 JULY 2004 IS HEREBY RE-PROVIDED BELOW, WITH NO CHANGES FROM THE 13 JULY 2004 POSTING. This publication constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as described in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.102(d)(2).  Any resulting contractual agreements based on responses to the BAA are considered to be the result of full and open competition in full compliance with the provisions of Public Law (PL) 98-369, “The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984.”  A formal Request for Proposals (RFP), solicitation, and/or additional information regarding this announcement will not be issued.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this announcement is 541710 with a small business size standard of 500. The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) will not issue paper copies of this announcement. NAVSEA reserves the right to select for award all, some or none of the proposals in response to this announcement. NAVSEA reserves the right to fund all, some or none of the proposals received under this BAA. NAVSEA provides no funding for direct reimbursement of proposal development costs.  Technical and cost proposals (or any other material) submitted in response to this BAA will not be returned.             Undersea Weapons Program Office (PMS404), Washington Navy Yard, Washington DC, is soliciting for research proposals that will aggressively incorporate flexible, affordable, and innovative torpedo signal processing control beyond its current baseline.  The mission of the Torpedo Advanced Processor Build  (APB) Program is to address rapidly changing technology and constantly evolving threats necessitating the need to redefine the methodology for producing torpedo modifications. The need to identify weapon system shortfalls, select the best solutions, and establish proper feedback processes and tools to enable a data-driven, build-test-build approach to continually improve system performance is crucial.  Primarily, the project’s scope will be defined by the development of torpedo signal processing algorithms involving signal processing, signal detection, signal classification and waveform design. The project will also address Weapon Control improvements and support tasks including combat system interface, communication interface control, transmit waveform control and internal torpedo communication functions. These tasks support the overall torpedo functionality.  The endstate to the proposed Torpedo APB Program will be the a! bility to maintain our undersea weapon advantage and thus ensuring maritime access and battle space superiority.  As an introduction to this new process, the Government will host a classified, to the Secret level,  Torpedo APB Program and Related Topics Industry Day.  Interested representatives of Government and Industry are encouraged to attend on Wednesday, 21 July 2004.  No foreign participation is allowed.  The briefing will be held at the Naval Undersea Warfare Center (NUWC) Division Newport from 8am until 5pm.  General questions about Industry Day should be addressed to Mark Campbell at (401) 832-8080 and detailed questions concerning this BAA or the Torpedo APB program must be submitted electronically to Richard D. Braendel II, SEA 02613B, at BraendelR@navsea.navy.mil.  Organizations wishing to send representatives should register via e-mail, by fax or in writing to the following addresses:  Email: campbellma@npt.nuwc.navy.mil Fax: 	(401) 832-1134 Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Newport Mark Campbell Code 8191, Building 990/2 1176 Howell Street Newport, RI 02841-1708 Information regarding security clearance/visit request and hotel information can be found at: http://www.npt.nuwc.navy.mil under Visitor Information. Attendance is limited to persons who have registered and have approved security clearances in place. Registration requests and security clearance/visitor requests should be received not later than 16 July 2004.  Registration requests will be confirmed by 20 July 2004. The scope of this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) and the proposals solicited are limited and will be used for identifying innovative algorithm processing techniques for future detailed development.  The Navy intends to award up to three (3) preliminary Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) studies, not-to-exceed (NTE) $100K each, from a total BAA budget of $300K.  However, the Navy reserves the right to award more, less or no studies as a result of this BAA.  Awards will be based on the merits of the proposals as evaluated by the Torpedo APB evaluation team.  Depending upon the success of the studies the potential exists for follow-on development contract awards.

NAVSEA is located at the Washington Navy Yard (WNY) where access is strictly limited in accordance with Naval District Washington (NDW) security regulations.  It is recommended that proposals be mailed in accordance with the BAA instructions.  In the event you prefer to hand carry your proposal, ensure adequate time has been allowed by your representative to accommodate the additional security procedures.  Detention at a NDW gate or failure to adhere to the procedures provided herein will not be considered an exception to timely proposal delivery.  Offerors hand carrying proposals shall call the contracting officer or contract specialist at least 48 hours prior to arriving at the WNY to make arrangements.  Offerors can enter the WNY via the First Street Gate off M Street SE.  Vehicles entering NDW are subject to random searches.  Visitors shall turn left onto Tingey Avenue at the end of the Southeast Federal Center at the second guard shack, show picture ID and follow Tingey!  Avenue until you have reached the last building on the right, Bldg 197.  Just before reaching another guard shack and before the end of  Bldg 197, you will see a loading dock directly across from the NDW Police Station.  Please pull into this loading dock area and notify your point of contact.  Packages should not be sealed as they are subject to inspection.  Classified material shall be prepared in accordance with current security requirements.  The contracting officer or contract specialist may receive the proposal and provide the Offeror a receipt with the time and date of delivery.  All offerors shall mark each package with the name of the contracting officer and the contract specialist, their codes and phone numbers.   Any proposal, modification, or revision, that is received at the designated Government office after the exact time specified for receipt of proposals is “late” and will not be considered unless:  (a)	If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized  by the announcement, it was received at the initial point of entry to the  Government infrastructure not later than 3:00 p.m. one working day prior  	      to the date specified for receipt of proposals; or (b)	There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the       Government installation designated for receipt of proposals and        was under the Government’s control prior to the time set for receipt of        proposals; or (c)	It was the only proposal received. However, a late modification of an otherwise timely and successful proposal that makes its terms more favorable to the Government will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted. Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the proposal wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel. If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that proposals cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of proposals by the exact time specified in the announcement, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the announcement closing date, the time specified for receipt of proposals will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the announcement on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume. The contracting officer must promptly notify any offeror if its proposal, modifications, or revision was received late and must inform the offeror whether its proposal will be considered. NOTE: FULL PROPOSALS SENT BY FAX OR E MAIL WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED. The Government’s rights in Proposals shall be in accordance with DFARS 252.227-7016, Rights in Bid or Proposal Information (Jun 1995), available at http://www.acq.osd.mil/dp/dars/dfars/html/r20040101/252.227-7016. Offerors must submit their technical proposals (10 paper copies and 1 electronic copy using Microsoft Suite) and cost proposals (3 paper copies and 1 electronic copy using Microsoft Suite) within the time period as stated above.  The technical and cost proposals must be provided as separate volumes;  no cost information shall appear in the technical proposal and no technical information shall appear in the cost proposal. Offerors may submit proposals on any or all areas of interest.  The Government reserves the right to select all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement.  Offerors must be able to certify that they have an appropriate facility clearance to meet the security requirements of work proposed, and key personnel must be certified as holding an appropriate clearance.

In order that the Government may verify this information offerors shall include in their proposals points-of-contact by name, title, and phone number. H. A detailed breakdown and summary of cost and price for the effort.  The  Offeror shall provide the number of proposed hours by labor category, all direct labor and indirect rates, a breakdown of any material costs proposed, and the proposed fee.  The Offeror shall also provide a point of contact, to include name, title, phone number and email address, at their cognizant Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) and Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA). The evaluation of proposals will be performed by the cognizant Program Officer and other naval and defense activities/agencies personnel, including the Naval Undersea Warfare Center (NUWC) Newport division, as needed.  All evaluation team members will be bound by appropriate non-disclosure agreements to protect proprietary and source-selection information. Due to NUWC Newport’s participation in the evaluation of proposals, and in order to avoid any potential conflicts of interest, proposals from the Naval Undersea Warfare Center will not be accepted or considered for award. Evaluation of proposals will be based on the following criteria: ·	To what degree does the proposal demonstrate potential for improving signal and weapon processing control beyond the current torpedo processing baseline (Block IV)? ·	Can the proposed study/development be completed in time to support the Torpedo APB schedule? ·	What is the probability that the proposed study effort will meet the objectives stated in the Offeror’s proposal? ·	Does the proposed study effort appear to be realistically achievable with the funds requested? ·	To what degree will the benefits of the proposed study effort be limited by restrictive data rights provisions or limited distribution of data? ·	What has been the Offeror’s past performance in signal processing algorithm enhancements and weapon control improvements? These criteria are in descending order of importance for evaluation purposes with the first three being significantly more important than the other evaluation criteria. At the conclusion of the evaluation, Offeror(s) will be notified, as applicable, that: 1) its proposal has been accepted for negotiation, 2) its proposal has been accepted pending the availability of funds, or 3) its proposal has not been accepted.  NAVSEA will retain and file one copy of non-accepted proposals; all other copies of non-accepted proposals will be destroyed.  Those proposals accepted pending the availability of funds may be considered for funding for up to twelve months after the closing date of this BAA.  Not all proposals evaluated as acceptable will be funded.  Decisions to fund acceptable proposals will be based on funds available and the evaluation criteria set forth in this document.

<SUBJECT>65 -- Medical Supplies and Pharmaceutical Acquisition Strategy
<DESC>In accordance with FAR 5.205(c), the following is a special notice of a draft specification for NAICS industry 424210 review: Effective 04 AUG 2004; Peace Corps Director, Office of Contracts instructed OPBF/C to begin the process of formalizing FAR 13.303 blanket purchase agreements (BPAs) with non-U.S. companies supplying pharmaceuticals and medical supplies directly to Peace Corps’ 70 country Posts. The purpose of formalizing these various agreements is to streamline the ordering process and achieve volume discounts. Please be advised that this in an interim measure. Companies that will hold BPAs will be required to provide Peace Corps with monthly ordering data, which may be used as the basis for a formal FAR 12 commercial acquisition.  Peace Corps Office of Volunteer Support, Medical Services (VS/OMS) Technical Guideline (TG) 200 provides medical supply guidance. Attachment A provides a standard (optimal) drug formulary of oral, topical and parenteral medications and vaccines for Peace Corps health units. Attachment B provides a standard (optimal) inventory of medical equipment and supplies for Peace Corps health units.  Overseas Sourcing of Medications and Vaccines: All medications and vaccines provided to Volunteers must be FDA-approved and manufactured in the U.S. with a minimum one-year shelf life (as appropriate) and as noted on the container. The only exceptions are: (1) Drugs and vaccines recognized by experts in the U.S. and elsewhere as being safe and effective for their prescribed or specific clinical use (FAR 6.302-1(c) brand name or equal example: tinidazole (Fasigyn), proguanil (Paludrine)). Such exceptions must be authorized by OMS or cited in the Technical Guidelines and, in general, are only allowed when no similar drug is available in the U.S. (2) Equivalent formulations of FDA-approved drugs and vaccines that are manufactured and marketed for use in Canada, Western Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan (e.g. mefloquine manufactured in Switzerland). Drugs and vaccines manufactured in countries other than those listed above may lack adequate regulation and inspection of the manufacturing process and, therefore, may not be as safe or reliable as those available from approved sources. Approved drugs and vaccines (as defined above) may be obtained from vendors in other countries who import their products from the countries listed (for example, South African companies that import drugs and vaccines manufactured and marketed for use in the United States, Canada, Western Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan). (3) Any other drugs or vaccines that have been individually approved by OMS. All drugs, vaccines, and suppliers that satisfy the criteria outlined above meet the approval of OMS. Approval to supply a drug or vaccine from an unapproved source, all available information about the manufacturer and product must be submitted to OMS.  Emergency Equipment and Supplies: Within the constraints of the local environment, all Posts must have the capability to respond to emergency or life-threatening conditions among Volunteers.  Medication Issues and Volunteers: All Trainees are asked by OMS to arrive in-country with a six month supply of their medications in order to provide Post with sufficient time to procure additional supply. Trainees often arrive at Post on Name Brand medications. When a generic equivalent is available at Post, the Peace Corps Medical Officer (PCMO) may make substitutions as appropriate. The Volunteer should be fully informed of any medication change to a generic product.  Storage: Peace Corps health units should have adequate storage areas for medical equipment and supplies. Storage areas should be secure for controlled medical substances. Pharmaceuticals should be stored in climate controlled conditions and temperature sensitive vaccines should be stored in a reliable refrigerator with minimum to maximum thermometer. If electricity is unreliable, a backup generator may be required to operate the medical refrigerator.  Disposal of Outdated Medical Supplies: Excess medical supplies with dated expired shelf life must be appropriately destroyed in the presence of the PCMO and a designated Peace Corps representative. Certified documentation should be kept by the office to support destruction action and recorded on the appropriate inventory record card. Under no circumstances will medicines be donated to any organizations because of liability issues may arise from tainted or expired medical supplies.  Medical Reference, Resource Materials, and Journals: PCMOs should maintain a selection of medical reference books and resource materials to assist in case management and in the production of training and educational materials. OMS recommends that each health unit subscribe to at least one journal and one health newsletter. These should cover topics relevant to the in country needs of Volunteers and should be able to provide background material for newsletters and training sessions.  DRUG FORMULARY & MEDICAL EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES: Copies of PC VS/OMS TG200 with Attachments A & B are available from the Contracting Officer by e-mail in .pdf image format in Adobe Acrobat Reader.

The contractor shall hire personnel whose work will support aspects of the following:  This study of nonfatal injuries and illnesses in Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) is by direction of the Assistant Secretary of Defense/Health Affairs to provide a better understanding of the medical issues related to the military operations in Iraq.  As agents of OASD/HA, investigators at USUHS will collect and analyze deployment and medical data from multiple sources within the Military Health System (MHS) in order to describe types and circumstances of nonfatal injuries and illnesses in the theater of operations with a focus on identifying potential points of preventive intervention.  The primary work site is the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS).  A secondary work site is the Deployment Health Support Directorate, Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Force Health Protection and Medical Readiness, Washington, DC, primarily for purposes of coordinating or facilitating data collection efforts.  The study will be under the direction of the principal investigators at USUHS, where the bulk of the analyses will be performed.  METHODS:  This is a descriptive epidemiologic analysis of the types and causes of nonfatal injuries and illnesses resulting from OIF, with a focus on the identification of health risk and possible safety issues as well as potential preventive interventions.  Investigators will identify, access, and characterize automated medical data on all nonfatal injury or illness events from multiple sources.  Unique identifiers will be used to link multiple databases to integrate in theater medical information, if possible.  An integrated database containing demographic, military service, and medical information will be constructed from available sources and will be assessed in terms of data elements, quality, missing information, and adequate numbers.  Investigators expect to have access to data from the following sources:  Service Casualty Office information – cases to include all nonfatal casualties identified by the casualty offices as wounded in action (WIA), both hostile and non-hostile; Safety investigation report – all nonfatal accident cases identified by the safety offices (which should overlap with the above); Joint Medical Work Station (JMeWS) – Disease Non-Battle Injury (DNBI) reports and electronic theater patient encounter records; TRANSCOM Regulating and Command and Control Evacuation System (TRAC2ES) – medical evacuations from theater; Theater Inpatient Admissions (if electronically available); Electronic individual medical data from the Defense Medical Surveillance System (entrance physical exam, inpatient and outpatient visits, personnel and deployment history, pre-and post-deployment health assessments).  For each case of nonfatal injury/illness identified for OIF through WIA, TRAC2ES, and Safety data systems during a 12-month period, all of the above electronic records will be sought and the data elements compiled, reviewed, abstracted, and summarized. Information that is coded and recorded in an analyzable format will be evaluated to determine reason for evacuation (if applicable) and the relationship to pre-deployment health status, mission factors, and safety and other issues. Descriptive analyses will integrate information from as many data sources as possible, and focus on force health protection issues, preventability of injuries and illnesses, similarities of circumstances, and operational/medical issues.  This study involves computerized demographic and health information and illness codes generated within the Military Healthcare System (MHS).  Once health information is linked, individual patient identifiers will be removed to protect patient confidentiality.  No individual patients will ever be traced, contacted, or notified.  Release of any information will be in aggregate form only.  For each medical event, the following factors will be assessed depending on data availability: Activity/Circumstances; Medical diagnosis and outcome; Pre-deployment health status; Mission factors; Other relevant factors.  DELIVERABLES:  Work on this study will conclude when the in-theater OIF medical database has been created, characterized, and analyzed.  This project is expected to be completed within approximately 12 months and will result in the following deliverables:  The final database constitutes a product with potential benefit to medical planners by (1) providing information on the strengths and weaknesses of the existing data collection and management system during military operations; (2) establishing whether or not existing medical data sources are adequate to address force health protection issues and to identify points for preventive measures; and (3) establishing a mechanism for using automated medical data to assess patterns and trends in medical events, which may be useful in predicting future health services resource needs in similar operational settings.  Detailed report of study findings for the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, including analysis, conclusions, and recommendations.  Publishable manuscript(s) for a peer-reviewed medical journal.  Final report accounting for budget, procedures, and other administrative issues.  MANAGEMENT OF PROTOCOL WORK: The principal investigators, or their designated representatives, will supervise all activities related to this protocol and delegate responsibilities and resources to associate investigators and contract personnel as appropriate.  Non-federal research support personnel will sign a standard form to ensure compliance with all federal regulations related to privacy issues.  All manuscripts, presentations, and interviews regarding this work must first be approved and coordinated by the principal investigators and the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense-Health Affairs, in addition to all other standard clearance procedures.  TIMELINE:  The period of performance is 12-months from date of award to provide review and analysis of nonfatal injuries and illness occurring in the OIF theater of operations.  Work on this study will conclude when the results of analyses have been summarized, and the findings have been interpreted and reported.  Study investigators will prepare a final written report to the Assistant Secretary of Defense-Health Affair, as well as manuscript(s) for publication in the peer-reviewed literature by the end of the 12-month period of performance.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 
“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 
(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

<DESC>This is an amendment to the combined synopsis/solicitation posted on July 30, 2004 for a Radio Frequency Identification Scan Tunnel, SSA-RFQ-04-0536.  Vendors are asked to remember that this is a test pilot for SSA.  The purpose of this amendment is to 1) Extend the deadline to accept quotes until COB on Tuesday July 17, 2004 and 2) provide vendors with information that was requested by interested parties: •  The pilot activity is to evaluate the value-added functionality of the RFID technology within SSA’s warehousing operation.•  The RFID Scan Tunnel must interface with Radio Beacon Warehouse Management Control System.  For specific information concerning Radio Beacon, contact www.radiobeacon.com •  Refer to FAR 52-212.1 – Instructions to Offerors, for guidance and instructions on how to respond.  Please remember that sufficient information must be provided to evaluate your quote and all representations and certifications must be completed.  Technical response should not include pricing.
• Reference the original combined synopsis/solicitation for information regarding existing experience and past performance.
• It is the contractor’s responsibility to develop the appropriate hardware solution to meet SSA’s requirements.
• It is the Governments expectation that the solution provider identify the proper solution to read 45 boxes on a pallet using the scan tunnel at the fastest, most accurate rate as possible.
• Integration will be preformed in Real-time via seamless integration directly to Radio Beacon.
• The government’s expectation is 100% readability.
• Due to the simplicity of the order, SSA does not feel site visits are necessary.

• There are no potential sources of RF interference.
• Cases are serialized using SSCC codes and Radio Beacon supports case serialization.
• There is no current or future process diagram available.
• External sensors are required because SSA needs to know the correct movement of stock, in or out of the warehouse.  Sensors provide the most effective and accurate solution to determine the travel direction.
• The use of the term intelligent tag refers to a smart tag with read/write capabilities that meet the UHF G2 standard.
• Data will be written to the tag as well as being printed on the label.
• 96 BITS of data will need to be written to the tag to support the required information.
• There is a memory requirement for the tag.

<CONTACT>Edwin Little, 703-692-6084
<DESC>The following answers are provided to the questions received in response to RFQ W74V8H-04-T-0149. Question 1:  Could you please give us any information you may have on the incumbent organization and the value of the contract?   Answer:  SeiCorp, Inc is the incumbent contractor with an annual value of $249,809.  The scope of the current contract is larger than the scope of the work effort being procured under this requirement.    Question 2:  Are teaming arrangements allowed?  If yes, can these teams include large businesses, as long as a small business is the team lead?  May multiple small businesses form a team to perform the work? Answer:  Teaming arrangements are allowed.  The teaming arrangement must be compliant with FAR clause 52.219-14 Limitations on Subcontracting (Dec 1996).      Question 3:  What is the estimated level of effort for manpower that you envision during the Base Year?  Over the  course of the contract? Answer:  In accordance with the RFQ the Government historical estimate for the requirement is one mid to senior level person per year. Question 4:  If I have a candidate that could do the job but would need a little training on the JPAT and CIS Viewer, would this candidate be acceptable?  Would training on JPAT and CIS Viewer be possible after contract award? Answer:  This question is addressed as part of the first evaluation criteria.  The Experience evaluation criteria includes the statement, Also, the contractor should have knowledge of resident Joint Staff quick look analysis tools - Joint Program Analysis Tool (JPAT) or Comptroller Information System (CIS) Viewer.  However, contract award will not be solely contingent upon an in-depth knowledge if acceptable information resource alternatives are provided.  Training on  JPAT and CIS Viewer is not possible; the successful offeror is expected to be reasonably conversant with these data systems.
