<DESC>Historic American Buildings Survey Yakima Project - Roza Building No. 50 The Bureau of Reclamation, Yakima Field Office, proposes to dispose of a small, 4- room residence, that was built by Reclamation in 1941 to house an employee of the Roza Irrigation Project.  The building is eligible for the National Register based on its association with the Yakima Project.  Disposal of the structure will most likely occur through dismantling, which has been determined to be an adverse effect.  Though the Section 106 process, an agreement between the Washington State Historic Preservation Officer and Reclamation deems adequate mitigation to consist of recording to the level II standard of the Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS).

<DESC>Under authority of FAR 13.106-1, The National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to negotiate on sole source basis, a contract with Nature Publishing Group, The MacMillan Bldg., 4 Crinan Street, London N1 9XW, UK.  The Contractor shall provide but is not limited to the following services:

•	Shall provide together in one volume, papers describing the Human Draft Sequence, the Finished Sequence and each of the published papers describing the 22 individual Autosomes and the two sex chromosomes in detail.
	
•	The volume shall contain any new material written by expert scientists commenting on the advance and how human genome sequence has advanced biomedical research so far.
	
•	Shall provide publication in both hard copy and electronic format and be made available to Nature subscribers for no additional cost.
	
•	Shall provide supplemental funding for this publication in an effort to keep the NHGRI’s costs down.
	
•	Shall reformat and negotiate all applicable copyrights.
	
•	These services shall be provided from August 2005 through July of 2006.
	The ordering office has stated that The Nature Publishing Group has several distinct benefits to publishing such a volume.  Nature has published every one of the other Human Genome papers and thus has ready access to the material without need to reformat or negotiate copyrights.  Nature has a very wide circulation that will aid in the dissemination of this material  
	Therefore, it is the Government’s belief that these requirements may only be met by Nature Publishing Group.  The estimated period of performance is for 11 months.  The Northern American Industry Classification System Code is 541850, with a size standard of $6.0.  This is not a formal solicitation, however, concerns that respond to this notice must furnish concise responses directed specifically to the requirements mentioned above.  Sources demonstrating the capability to accomplish the above shall supply pertinent information in sufficient detail to demonstrate their ability to perform.  Information furnished shall include enough material to perform a proper evaluation.  Respondents will not be notified of the evaluation results.

<DESC>Under authority of FAR 13.106-1, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to negotiate on sole source basis a contract with Statens Serum Institute, 5 Artillerivej DK2300, Copenhagen, Denmark.  The contractor shall provide but shall not be limited to the following services:

•	Shall provide research of immune-pathology associations with antibodies to PSA capsular polysaccharide of Neisseria meningitidis group B.
	
•	Shall investigate and provide research as to whether women with previous GBM infections have an increased waiting time to pregnancy (TTP) as a measure of early spontaneous abortions.
	
•	Shall investigate and provide research as to whether women with previous GBM infections have an increased risk of spontaneous abortion and stillbirth.
	
•	Shall investigate and provide research as to whether children born of mothers with previous GBM infections are at increased risk of infant death and hospital admittance because of neurodevelopmental disorders compared to children born of mothers with previous infection with other serogroups of meningocci and the background population. 
	
•	Shall investigate and provide research as to whether persons with previous GBM infection have an increased risk of hospital admittance due to autoimmune disease compared to persons with previous infection with other serogroups of meningococci and the background population. 
	
•	Shall investigate and provide research as to whether persons with previous GBM infection are more prone to have had a blood sample taken to analysis for autoimmune markers compared to persons with previous infection with other serogroups of meningococci and the background population.
	
•	Shall investigate and provide research aas to whether persons with previous GBM infection show evidence of increased risk for autimmune disease as indicated by biological assays compared to persons with previous infection with other serogroups of meningococci and the background population. 
	
•	Shall have access to the records of at least 3,000 confirmed cases of GBM to be used in the study.
	
•	Shall analyze the data using multivariate regression models, and incidence rate ratios shall be estimated with adjustment confounders such as age, sex, calendar time and birth order. 
	
	It is the government’s belief that these requirements can only be met by The Statens Serum Institute.  The Statens Serum Institute is unique in that it has at it’s disposal the retrospective and prospective clinical studies of patients with this relatively rare infection.  Study cohorts of this type are very difficult and expensive to assemble.  The Northern American Industry Classification System Code is 62151.  The estimated period of performance is 12 months.  This is not a formal solicitation, however, concerns that respond to this notice must furnish concise responses directed specifically to the requirements mentioned above.  Sources demonstrating the capability to accomplish the above shall supply pertinent information in sufficient detail to demonstrate their ability to perform.  Information furnished shall include enough material to perform a proper evaluation.  Respondents will not be notified of the evaluation results.

<DESC>THIS SYNOPSIS PROVIDES NOTICE THAT THE FHWA PLANS TO ISSUE A REQUEST FOR APPLICATIONS RESTRICTED TO STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.  THIS REQUIREMENT WILL RESULT IN MULTIPLE AWARDS OF COOPERATIVE AGREEMENTS.  The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is contemplating the award of multiple (approximately 2 to 6) demonstration and evaluation projects for a performance period of 24 months.   A total of $500,000 in Federal funds is available in fiscal year 2005 to fund from two to six demonstration and evaluation projects for a period of 24 months.  Individual award amounts are expected to range between $50,000 - $100,000.  The applicant’s 20 percent match requirement can be met through direct financial contribution or through “in-kind” services.  This Request for Applications (RFA) will only be released and available electronically at http://www.eps.gov.  Accordingly, NO written, telephone, facsimile or email requests for the RFA package will be accepted.  The Government anticipate issuing a RFA package, solicitation number DTFH61-05-RA-00111, on or about, July 26, 2005, by posting it on the website www.eps.gov. Estimated proposal due date is on or about 30 days from release of the solicitation, with an estimated award date of 26 Oct 05.  Since this solicitation will only be available electronically, it will be the responsibility of interested parties to monitor the eps.gov website for any solicitation amendments.  The objective of these demonstration and evaluation projects is to determine the extent to which gateways lead to lower speeds and improved safety on main roads in rural communities.  This cooperative agreement program requires each recipient to conduct a carefully planned demonstration and evaluation of implementing a gateway for speed management.  The recipient will designate a specific demonstration community (or group of communities).  A demonstration community is the geopolitical area where the speed management demonstration will take place.  This could be a State, a county, a city, a township, a borough, or any defined geographic entity or group of geographic entities within the United States with a clear governing body.    All applications forms may be found at www.fhwa.dot.gov/aaa/forms2.htm.  THIS WAS INITIALLY POSTED ON FEDGRANTS.GOV.  All questions concerning this requirement shall be addressed directly to the contractual point of contact at Robin.Hobbs@FHWA.dot.gov.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is HSCEAM-05-R-00032, which is issued as a Request For Proposal (RFP).    This requirement will be an unrestricted acquisition.  The proposed contract will be for one (1) base year and four (4) one year options.  The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 611699.  Services anticipated to begin on or about January 3, 2006.  

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has a requirement for a firearms range to conduct mandatory quarterly qualifications and other firearms training.  The range shall be within a 30 minute commute of the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport.  The 30 minute commute will be assessed in consideration of prime, rush hour traffic in both the morning and late afternoon/early evening.

The proposed range must meet the following  standards to qualify for consideration:  

The range time must be available exclusively to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) during the hours indicated. The range must be closed to the public during the corresponding hours and the hours for use should be scheduled .  The range may be indoor or outdoor.  The range must possess a minimum of 10 firing points and must be able to accommodate a qualification course distance minimum of 1.5 yards and a maximum of 25 yards.  The range must possess moveable barricades for the 25- and 15-yard line courses of fire.  The barricades shall be constructed of a material that does not deflect or ricochet rounds that inadvertently strike it. (Example:  wood).  The range shall possess adequate exterior lighting in both public and work areas. The range shall possess drinking fountains located near the range facilities for DHS use. The range shall be equipped with men and womens restroom facilities with running water located near the range facilities for DHS use.  The range shall provide adequate parking to accommodate 15 vehicles and coincide with the location of cited above (30 minute commute of the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky Airport).  The range must possess an on-site classroom facility with chalkboard or marker board to accommodate 10 (ten) students.

The range rules must allow movement between firing points and will not restrict movement-oriented firearms training by students (i.e. standing to kneeling transitions.).  The range rules will allow shooters to draw and fire from the holster.  The range rules cannot disallow a student from moving in front of the firing points with an instructor present, (i.e., tactical move and shoot type drills where instructor/student ratio would be too restrictive).   Indoor ranges must possess air conditioning, heating, and an approved ventilation system that conforms to existing OSHA standards.    

	DHS personnel will use the range an average of 8 days per month.
The estimated number of rounds fired is 80,000 per year.    The range must be closed or concealed from the public during the corresponding hours.  Under this contract, DHS requires exclusive use of the range in four hour blocks  from 0800 to 1800 hours, and blocks in the evening for night/low shooting.  This does not include weekends or holidays, however, there are may occasionally be circumstances wherein a day of the weekend may be needed.  Should weather (i.e, rainout) or unforeseen circumstances prevent the use of the range, DHS will have priority in re-scheduling those missed days within the same month, if possible, or the following month if not possible.


	The proposed contract will be for one (1) base year and four (4) one –year options.  Offerors shall submit pricing for all range requirements.:

If range is outdoors, an inclement weather covering will be required nine months after award ensuring a dry shooting environment when it rains.

Offeror shall submit prices for months one though nine without operational turning target system.  Awardee must ensure an operational turning target system will be available by the beginning of month 10 and pricing shall be submitted for  months ten, eleven and twelve inclusive (of operational turning target system).

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.eps.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command. General Description and Requirements The Program Executive Office, Integrated Warfare Systems (PEO IWS), Washington Navy Yard, Washington, D.C. is soliciting new and innovative concepts for submarine twin and multi-line towed array systems that provide increased gain over current Fast Attack Class thin-line towed systems. The concepts may include array design, manufacturing technology, handling systems and spatial/temporal adaptive processing methods, innovative information management and rendering or any significant component thereof. Array designs should seek to approximate TB-29/33 acoustic performance in each array, and capitalize on spatial arrangement.  System array gain should be greater than current single line arrays when measured in representative waters against signals of interest.  Arrays should be low noise and reliable up to moderate speeds.  They should incorporate the means to measure relative position and array heading.  They should have a means to avoid entanglement with each other.  The array and tow cable should be useable in any depth of water that submarines currently operate in.  Innovative array designs allowing replenishment (weed-whacker) without replacement, incorporating light weight or small cross-section, useable at higher frequencies than current TB-29/33 will be considered.  Array designs should seek to achieve such high reliability/survivability as to achieve greater than 95% Operational Availability (goal) as measured over a deployment. Handling system designs should be able to handle multiple arrays, measure and control the arrays’ lateral and fore-and-aft position while deployed.  There should be a method of monitoring handler activity.  Handler designs should seek to achieve simplicity, and such high reliability/survivability as to achieve greater than 95% Operational Availability (goal) as measured over a deployment. Inboard electronics designs shall address multiple arrays, coherent array processing, automated left-right ambiguity resolution, adaptive spatial/temporal processing, automated noise measurement, steerable nulls, and automated ranging.  Inboard application software must be able to not only cope with, but take advantage of array curvature and positions other than straight and parallel.  There must be sufficient trackers to handle expected contact loads, and contact followers to support trackers.  Tracker performance must be capable of following multiple, crossing contacts without loss or confusion.  The system must be capable of recording up to 100 hours of element level data.  The system must support replay of recorded events. The navy is seeking an aggressive program whereby the future production recurring costs, including installation, are less than $4M.  The total system must have at least 90% Operational Availability (goal) when measured over a deployment.  The system design or individual component design may consider trading tactical speed, deployment depth, deployment/retrieval speed and depth, and max deployed speed against desired metrics such as reliability, acoustic performance, size, weight, subject to concurrence from the Program Office. Technologies or approaches that are expandable to other ASW platforms are preferable.  The Navy’s primary objective in this solicitation is to acquire readily transferable technologies that will significantly increase array gain, reliability and survivability in littoral waters. BAA Scope The scope of this BAA is a 2 step process.  Step 1 is an invitation to submit White Papers describing new and innovative concepts for submarine twin and multi-line towed array systems that provide increased gain over current Fast Attack Class thin-line towed systems.  White papers are initially sought to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of the offeror in preparing full technical and cost proposals without an initial assessment of the technical and operational feasibility of the concept.  Offerors submitting white papers may be invited to submit a full technical and cost proposal on all or part of their white paper submission. This will be based on the Navy’s assessment of potential operational value based on technical merit and feasibility of the offeror’s submittal relative to the requirements outlined in “General Desciption and Requirements’ above. However, any such invitation does not assure a subsequent award.  Teaming of academia, industry, and government laborat! ories to develop new and innovative concepts and speed their transition to the fleet is highly encouraged.  Step 2 will be for full technical and cost proposal in two Phases; Phase I will be an initial award with an option for Phase II.  The scope of Phase I should be to develop the proposed concept in a manner that allows Navy Subject Matter Experts to cooperatively evaluate its feasibility.  The scope of Phase II should be to conduct a shore-based feasibility demonstration to convince Navy Subject Matter Experts that the proposed concept can work.  The planned schedule for this BAA is as follows: BAA will be open through 15 September 2005 when White Papers are due; Navy completes review of White Papers and invites (as appropriate) fully priced proposals for Step 2, Phases I and II by 07 October 2005; Step 2 proposals received 07 November 2005; award multiple contracts by 23 December 2005.  The awarded contracts are planned to be Cost Plus Fixed Fee.  NAVSEA and affiliated ! PEOs have funded related technology development under numerous programs.  Proposals that build on current or previous DoD work are encouraged.

NOTE: The following provisions with a "Fill-in" MUST BE COMPLETELY FILLED OUT and submitted with the offer: 52.222-25 [FILL-IN];  52.222-36 [FILL-IN]  252.225-7000 [FILL-IN]. CAR-L01  NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE SUPPLIERS (OCT 2003) (a) Past performance for this procurement will be evaluated using the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) Program.  RYG is authorized by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Acquisition) for use in the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain, and operate the Fleet. (b) The Government reserves the right to award to the supplier whose quote represents the best value to the Government.  As such, the basis for award will include an evaluation of each supplier’s past performance history for the Federal Supply Class(s) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) of the supplies and services being purchased.  The price to be considered in determining best value will be the evaluated price after application of Technical Evaluation Adjustments (TEAs). (c) The procedures described in the clause entitled "Additional Evaluation Factor for Consideration of Past Performance--Navy Red/Yellow/Green Program (APR 1999)" will be used to a! ssist in determining the best value for the Government. CAR-M01  ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTOR FOR CONSIDERATION OF PAST PERFORMANCE—NAVY RED/YELLOW/GREEN PROGRAM (APR 1999) (a) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) Program, authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services used to build, maintain, and operate the Fleet. (b) The purpose of RYG is to assist contracting personnel during source selection to determine the best value for the Government.  The program uses accumulated supplier past performance data to classify each supplier’s performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s) (FSCs) as either red (high risk), yellow (moderate risk), green (low risk), or neutral (no risk established).  (c) To assist in source selection, a monetary assessment in the form of a Technical Evaluation Adjustment (TEA) is added to each supplier’s quote having a red or yellow classification!  for the FSC involved.  The dollar amount of the red or yellow TEA assessment is based on the cost to the Government of effecting additional actions required to assure performance by a supplier with an unsatisfactory performance history for the FSC(s) involved.  No TEA is assessed for a supplier having either a green or a neutral FSC RYG classification.  For purposes of the RYG program, a neutral classification is assigned to suppliers who are first time quoters to the Government for the FSC(s) involved, suppliers otherwise having no past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved, and suppliers whose past performance data in the RYG database for the FSC(s) involved are over three years old.  After consideration of any other pertinent, price-related factors (e.g., transportation charges, first article testing, discount terms), the adjusted price becomes the basis for determining award.  A supplier’s FSC RYG classification may change over time as new or revi! sed performance data becomes available.  (d) RYG Classifications are summarized as follows:  (1) Green is low risk.  No performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  No TEA will be assessed. (2) Yellow is moderate risk.  Additional performance assurance actions are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier’s price to reflect the Government’s estimated additional costs. (3) Red is high risk.  Significant additional performance assurance requirements are considered necessary.  A TEA will be applied to the prospective supplier’s price to reflect the Government’s estimated additional costs.  (4) Neutral is no risk established.  No TEA is assessed; nevertheless, additional performance assurance requirements may be considered necessary to assure quality and on-time delivery.  (e) RYG classifications for all applicable FSCs are established monthly for each supplier and provided to them.  Suppliers may address questions about the program or their FSC RYG classifications to the Naval Sea Logistics Center (NLSC) Portsmouth Detachment! , Federal Building, Room 400, 80 Daniel Street, Portsmouth, NH  0380l-3884, telephone 603-431-9460, ext. 464.  FAX 603-431-9464.  Suppliers may also access their individual FSC RYG classifications through the automated vendor access program.  To obtain automated access, written request must be submitted on company letterhead to NLSC at the above address.  The request must include the requester’s name, title, company name, address, telephone number and Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code.  The CAGE code is mandatory.  In response, NLSC will provide each supplier, without charge, with an individual password, all required software, and information on accessing its individual data. To be eligible for award you must be properly registered in the Government's Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Offerors may obtain information on CCR registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at www.ccr.gov.  Lack of registration in the CCR shall make an offeror INELIGIBLE FOR AWARD. Past performance will be evaluated using the Navy's RED/YELLOW/GREEN program as follows: (A) This procurement is subject to the Navy's Contractor Evaluation System, Red/Yellow/Green (RYG) program. RYG is authorized by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition) for the acquisition of commodities used to build and maintain the Fleet--materials, parts and components of ships, planes and weapons systems. (B) The Government reserves the right to award to the contractor whose offer represents the best overall purchase value to the Government. As such, the basis for contract award will include an evaluation of ! proposed contractor's quality performance history. The price to be considered in determining the best value will be the evaluated price after Technical Evaluation Adjustments (TEA) or related quality assurance actions, as applicable, are applied to the offered price. (C) The procedures described in the clause of this solicitation entitled "ADDITIONAL EVALUATION FACTORS--CONTRACTOR EVALUATION SYSTEM, RED/YELLOW/GREEN PROGRAM (MAY 1992)" will be used by the Contracting Officer to assist in determining the best purchase value for the Government - price, past quality performance and other factors considered.

In support of Sub-factor (B), the offeror shall identify each subconsultant by name, discipline and size status and also identify, in terms of dollar values and percentage of total proposed price, the extent of work you will perform as the prime contractor.  The offeror is advised that the Government-wide goals for the total value of all prime contract per fiscal year are 23% to SB, 5% each to SDB, WOSB and 3% each to HUBZone SB and SDVOSB, and 5% to HBCU/MI.  In addition, the Naval Facilities Engineering Command FY 05 subcontracting targets in term of dollar value of subcontracts are 74.85% to SB, 15.6% to SDB, 13.92% to WOSB, 1.17% to HUBZone SB and .12% to SDVOSB.  FAR 52.219-8, Utilization of Small, Small Disadvantaged and Women-Owned Small Business Concerns states in part; the Contractor hereby agrees to carry out this policy in the awarding of subcontracts to the fullest extent consistent with efficient contract performance.  If the offeror does not intend to subcontract, provide a detailed explanation why subcontracting would not result in efficient contract performance.  The offerors are reminded that in order to receive proposal evaluation benefit as SDB or HUBZone SB either as prime or subconsultant, proposed SDBs and HUBZoneSBs must be certified by the Small Business Administration.  Prime contractors may determine whether a prospective subconsultant is a certified SDB or HUBZone by accessing the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at www.ccr.gov.  Effective January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) will require the use of On-Line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as part of the proposal submission process.

Award of task orders will be on a firm fixed price basis.  The work to be acquired under this solicitation is for primarily by design-build or secondarily design-bid-build of paving and associated site improvements at various locations within the NAVFAC Southwest area of responsibility, including but not limited to, Arizona, California, Nevada, and New Mexico.

Contractors are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee.  The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award contract(s) without discussions.

<CONTACT>Ryan T. Parker Contracting Officer 2123633206114  ryan_parker@nps.gov;
<DESC>The National Park Service at the Statue of Liberty National Monument is issuing a solicitation (Request for Quotation - RFQ) for the design and implementation of a program for a baseline data collection relating to physical and environmental conditions at the Statue of Liberty National Monument, New York, NY.  Data desired for collection generally includes copper skin thickness, surface temperature, and time of wetness measurements, as well as ambient air temperatures and relative humidity. The solicitation and any attachments will be posted to the Governmentwide Point of Entry (GPE) website, http://www.fedbizopps.gov on or about August 5, 2005.  The NAICS 2002 code for this project is 541330 with a size standard of four million dollars, ($4,000,000.00). The copper skin of the Statue of Liberty is slowly eroding as a result of natural copper patination processes.  To better understand these processes and to attempt to quantify the rate of copper loss on the Statue, additional documentation is currently being compiled.  One key aspect of this effort is to establish an existing condition baseline, and to lay the infrastructure for monitoring ongoing rates of development.  The contractor shall be responsible to institute protocols, design and install appropriate systems, and conduct an initial round of measurements.

<DESC>Contractors provide air tanker aircraft to the USDA Forest Service (FS) that are fully operational and drop approved fire suppressant/retardant material on forest and range fires over all types of terrain.  These aircraft are operated continuously at low levels (typically 150 feet AGL) in steep mountainous terrain, and are subjected to highly turbulent environments and increased accelerations relative to the role for which the aircraft were designed.  A Structural Health Monitoring System (SHMS) designed by Systems & Electronics, Inc. of Elk Grove Village, Illinois, has been installed on part of the air tanker fleet, as well as the resulting data being evaluated.  The monitoring system is part of an on-going project to verify the airworthiness and structural life limits of the aging air tanker fleet.  The equipment used for data collection and the data gathered by that equipment must be uniform in content and format to be compatible with the existing SHMS in order to provide reliable, consistent, and accurate structural data analysis for the entire fleet throughout future years.  In order to maintain monitoring system compatibility and data reliability, the FS intends to acquire on a sole-source basis from Systems & Electronics, Inc., the installation of SHMS’s into the remaining seven (7) Aero Union P-3 Air Tankers, and the data processing of recorded flight data from one DC-7 Air Tanker and eight (8) P-3 air Tankers for a one-year period.  
Any offeror interested in submitting a technical proposal in response to this notice is invited to do so.  Proposals shall provide a complete explanation of how their proposed structural monitoring equipment and data collection and reporting capability is currently compatible in every way with the existing installed SHMS from Systems & Electronics, Inc.  Past performance information relative to the installation and evaluation of data from the proposed system is also required.  Please note that proposals received as a result of this notice will be considered only for the purpose of determining whether the proposed system is compatible and uniform to the Systems & Electronics, Inc. SHMS, and if so, whether or not it is possible to obtain an equivalent system through competitive processes.

<DESC>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration,   (DHHS), through the Program Support Center, intends to negotiate a sole-source award with Community Anti- Drug Coalitions of America (CADCA).
Purpose:

The National Leadership Forum is held every year to bring together the nation’s community anti-drug coalitions, State leaders, Federal representatives and experts throughout the country in the field of substance abuse prevention.  The Forum was originally developed and hosted by the President’s National Drug Advisory Council and was turned over to the Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America (CADCA) to sustain the effort.  The National Leadership Forum scheduled for February 14-16, 2006 is the twenty-first Forum to be held at the Washington, DC Convention Center.  

The Leadership Forum is designed to be an interactive exchange of knowledge and information about what is working in substance abuse prevention, to share lessons learned about the importance of community mobilization and activism and disseminate knowledge on evidence-based programs and practices shown to be effective in reducing the rates of drug abuse and addiction among America’s youth.
The National Leadership Forum is the only national conference focused on strengthening coalitions in support of substance abuse issues which is supported by all of the federal agencies engaged in substance abuse reduction services including: the Office of National Drug Control Policy; the Department of Education; the Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration and Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, the Department of Health and Human Services: SAMHSA (CSAT & CMHS), National Institute on Drug Abuse, National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism; and the National Guard Bureau Counterdrug Program. The Leadership Forum program agenda is developed and designed by CADCA staff, and an advisory committee consisting of community leaders and government representatives.  The Leadership Forum is a widely attended event by both volunteers and professionals in the substance abuse prevention field. Based on their years of experience and knowledge, CADCA provides the participants of the Leadership Forum with the insights, knowledge and informed perspectives that are required to ensure the success of our Nation’s community coalitions in their ongoing work in substance abuse prevention.

<DESC>NAVAIR Orlando, TSD intends to contract on a sole-source basis with RDR, Inc in support of the Multi-purpose Supporting Arms Trainer (MSAT) Phase II development effort.  The immediate requirement is to develop MSAT software components (Observer Interface, CIGI Interface, HLA Interface, Munition Manager, Trajectory Manger, Air Asset Manger, Aural Cues Manager), complete component integration, develop and conduct system testing, develop Software Version Description documentation and support Phase II installation in accordance with the technical approach developed with the Analysis of Alternatives and MSAT Phase I/II system design.  These components will used to support a large field of view, open architecture, procedural call for fire (artillery, mortar and naval gunfire assets) and Close Air Support (fixed and rotary-wing) training capability.  

Contractor personnel performing the work specified under this contract shall require the following knowledge and experience: MSAT System Design, Forward Observer Training System (FOTS) Software baseline ECP6 development environment, USMC In-direct Call For Fire Procedures  (Artillery, Mortar & Naval Gunfire), Knowledge of Close Air Support 9 Line, Component Integration understanding of, Joint Semi-Automated Forces (JSAF), Deployed Virtual Training Environment (DVTE) Flight Component, MSAT IOS, Mak Technologies Stealth XR, Navy Continuous Training Environment Interoperability Requirements, HLA run-time software environments and HLA interface standards

RDR Inc’s participation in MSAT Phase I Integrated Project Team Analysis, System Design and development coupled with previous RDR’s experience on Forward Observer Training System development that required expertise in developing Asset, Trajectory and Munition Managers makes this a logical follow-on effort for RDR.  

Through previous 8(a) GSA FAST awards N61339-02-F-0230 and N61339-04-F-0308 RDR, Inc has acquired these skill sets over a three-year period of existing system modification to the Forward Observer Training System and over the last year has been an integral team member of the MSAT IPT.  RDR designed and developed an HLA compliant architecture to allow interoperability, implemented a true 3-D trajectory to provide realistic ballistic fly-out modeling and munition range limitations, developed voice recognition and data parsing to provide an intelligent tutor, developed an automated Fire Direction Center response to provide USMC compliant Call For Fire procedures, assisted in the design of the MSAT architecture, validated interface requirements for components listed in Para. 4. e., and participated in all SME data collection of CAS and CFF.

Full & Open competition would require that any other vendor conduct lengthy analysis of presently developed technical approach and system design.  Additionally, it would require review Phase I capability based on existing GOTS/COTS technology and would require significant SME understanding of Close Air Support and Supporting Arms functionality (Artillery, Mortar & Naval Gunfire).  The Government believes this effort would require 3-6 months of analysis and review to adequately perform these services.  This significant analysis and review would result in duplicated costs to the Government that would not be recovered.  The contract’s period of performance will be eight (8) months.

Sources that wish to express capabilities that contradict the above justification should submit such capabilities to the identified contact specialist no later than the closing date of this notice.  Statement of Work is posted at the NAVAIR Orlando TSD Business Opportunities Website http://www.ntsc.navy.mil/EBusiness/BusOps/Acquisitions/Index.cfm?RND=23775

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command at Patuxent River, MD, intends to negotiate and award a time and materials order to procure a series of Multi-Degree-of-Freedom Lumped-Parameter Mathematical Models of a CH-46E Mixbox Gear System.  Phase one of the effort includes review of all available existing H-46 Mixbox vibration data and representative Mixbox hardware, prior to the development of the models.  Once developed, the models will be validated using vibration model predictions with previously obtained aircraft vibration data.  During phase two of the effort, there will be an interactive effort to model physical changes to the H-46 Mixbox Gear System in order to assess impact and ensure other components of the transmission are not negatively impacted.  The proposed order will be procured under an existing Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA), N00019-05-G-0012, and will be awarded on a sole source basis to the Boeing Company, Boeing Helicopters, Ridley Park, PA. The authority permitting other than full and open competition is Title 10, U.S. Code, Section 2304(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Boeing is the sole designer, developer, and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of the H-46 helicopter and retains exclusive proprietary rights to all technical data necessary to perform these efforts.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The U.S. Army TACOM-Picatinny, Picatinny, N.J. intends to issue a limited  competition RFP W15QKN-05-R-0122  for the System Development and Demonstration  (SD&D) Phase and Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) Options of the Intelligent  Munitions System (IMS).  IMS is being developed as an evolutionary acquisition  in an incremental approach.   The Increment 1 system, of which the SD&D phase  applies, is being developed to support the U.S. Landmine Policy to field a  replacement capability for the existing family of non-self-destructing  landmines.  The Increment 1 system will support the Future Combat System (FCS)  Spiral-Out plan to field FCS technology earlier to the Current Force.  IMS  provides an unattended ground sensorâ€™s link to lethal and non-lethal scalable  effects components via integrated and robust command, control systems and is  employed by multiple delivery means.  An IMS is defined as a Dispenser Module  (DM) and a Control Station (CS).  A DM has both a stand alone capability,  providing a minimum of a 35 meter-diameter obstacle, or employed in quantity,  DMs serve as a building block for larger, integrated obstacles, controllable by  a single CS.  TACOM-Picatinny intends to limit competition under the authority  of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii) to the two Technology Phase (TD) development  contractors, Textron Systems Corp. and General Dynamics Advanced Information  Systems.  These contractors were selected as a result of Full and Open  Competition (formal source selection) for the 28 month TD effort which is  nearing completion.  It is anticipated that the Government will issue a Cost- Plus-Incentive-Fee (CPIF) type contract for the 32 month SD&D phase with Firm  Fixed Price Options.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to extend the due date for which proposals are due from August 15, 2005 to August 24, 2005.

The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Office of Freight Operations has a need to study selected States’ Overweight Commercial Vehicle permitting programs to determine their methods of operation and their procedures for issuing permits to commercial motor carries for oversize (OS) and overweight (OW) loads.  The objectives of this study are to describe the basis (e.g. legislative, economic, environmental) for each surveyed State’s issuance of OS/OW permits to commercial motor carriers, define the scope of issuance activity (e.g. single-trip, multi-trip, season-specific, commodity-specific), identify where permitted OS/OW operations take place within the sample State, determine the extent to which commercial motor carriers seek permits and the major reasons, identify State methods for tracking OS/OW operations (if any), evaluate State screening preceding permit award, compare state permit fee structures, and determine how revenues from permit issuances are used.   The contractor will develop and propose appropriate statistical methodologies to gather a robust sample of quantitative and qualitative information about various States’ OS/OW permit operations.  NO FURTHER SOLICITATION INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  This solicitation, all related documents, and amendments, if any, will only be released and available electronically through the Electronic Posting System (EPS) at http://eps.arnet.gov under the “EPS for Vendors” option followed by selection of the “DOT” center.  Accordingly, no written, telephone, facsimile or email requests for the solicitation package will be accepted.  Interested parties can register at the aforementioned site for a free “Acquisition Notification Service” to receive procurement announcements by email.  Be sure to “Register to receive all notices from selected organization”.  Since this solicitation will only be available electronically, it will be the responsibility of interested parties to monitor the EPS website for any solicitation amendments.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal, which shall be considered by FHWA.

<DESC>Amendment 1 Date Issued:  25 July 2005 Closing Date and Time: 12 August 2005 1630 Hours (Local Time)  81MM  Illuminating Mortar Candle Production The Office of the Product Manager for Combat Ammunition Systems is conducting a  market survey to identify additional  potential sources capable of production  of  fielded and/or developed  candle assemblies for 81mm Illuminating Mortar  Cartridges (see cartridge descriptions and candle performance parameters  below). Potential candidates must have the production capability to produce a  combination of 10,000 candles for the M816 Infra-red (IR) and M853A1 Visible  Light (VL) per month with a total annual production of 100,000. The Government  is interested only in those potential offerors who have specific knowledge in  this subject matter and have experience and the ability, to become a qualified  producer by  July  2006. A qualification contract is anticipated to be awarded  in January 2006 based on favorable evaluation of the white papers. Potential  offerors shall submit a white paper, not to exceed ten pages describing  current/planned production facilities and processes.  A detailed process map  identifying critical processes is required.  Potential offeror must also  describe a schedule of  how the design supports a qualification program to test  this design by July  2006.  A TDP for the 81mm Cartridge canister is  available. A canister is defined as a metal candle case containing the candle  mix. The 81mm Cartridge Descriptions and Candle Assembly Performance  Parameters: The M816 and M853A1 are fin stabilized Illuminating Mortar  Cartridges which have a body assembly, consisting of a thin aluminum wall body  tube and an aluminum tail cone. The body shall contain the candle mix in a  metal candle case with a swivel assembly.  The parachute is also contained in  the body and is connected to the swivel assembly of the candle case which  contains the illuminant mix. The weight of both M816 and M853A1 candle  assemblies shall be approximately 2.5 pounds each. The M853A1 candle shall  produce a minimum visible light of 525,000 candelas and shall burn for a  minimum of 50 seconds in the air. The M816 candle shall produce a minimum  infrared light of 50 Watts/Steradian (within wavelength 0.75 to 0.95 microns)  and a maximum of 400 candelas visible light. The candle shall burn for a  minimum of 60 seconds in the air. The candle case shall be cylindrical and  shall have a diameter of less than 2.782 inch and a maximum length of 5.102  inches.  During cartridge launch, the candle will experience a maximum setback  of 12,000 G.  At a predetermined time during the flight of the cartridge, the  fuze will function and shall ignite the candle with the flash produced by the  black powder (4.9 grams) in the fuze. The fuze activation will produce a  maximum of approximately 1,000 PSI pushing the candle towards the tail cone  direction and thereby pushing the candle and parachute assembly out of the  cartridge.  During this parachute deployment, the candle will experience a  maximum setback of 900 G. (This is equivalent to a snatching force of 2000  pounds or less).  This force tries to pull the illuminant mix out of the candle  case.  Both M816 and M853A1 candle shall be able to withstand all the forces  specified here.   This is a sources sought notice for planning purposes only. This is not a  solicitation and does not obligate the Government to issue a solicitation. The  Government will not pay for any information submitted under this announcement.  All responses are requested not later than  12 August 2005, 1630 Hours (Local  Time), to: e-mail jaclyn.dolivo@us.army.mil , or Picatinny Center for  Contracting and Commerce ATTN: AMSTA-AQ-APC, Bldg. 10, Picatinny Arsenal,  NJ07806-5000 Attn: Jaclyn Dâ€™Olivo.

<DESC>POC:  Tangee Brookie, U. S. Geological Survey, P. O. Box 25046, MS-204A, Denver, CO 80225, e-mail: tbrookie@usgs.gov.  The U. S. Geological Survey, Geologic Division, Central Energy Team, has a need for seismic data set for the Russian Barents and Kara Seas.  This seismic data set (37,700 km) represents the most important geologic information that can be used to assess the petroleum potential of this region, which is the goal of the World Energy Project.  The USGS seeks a contractor that has completed processing and interpretation of 37,700 km of seismic lines in the Russian part of the Barents and Kara Seas, and can modify these maps in accordance with USGS needs, construct cross sections and other accompanying geologic documents, and prepare a report on structure and Geologic Evolution of the Barents-Kara shelf.  Based on information available at this time, and in accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(1), implemented by FAR 6.302-1, the Government considers the services specified as a sole source from Dr. Yury Shipelkevitch, Galernaya Street, 32, Apt. 14, St. Petersburg, 190000, Russia, and proposes to negotiate a contract with that contractor on that basis.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered.  Firms who feel that they can provide these services are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement.  An affirmative response would include literature, brochures, and such other materials which correspond to the required items stated herein.  This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  Since no solicitation document exists, requests for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration.  This notice may represent the Government's only official notice of this procurement.

The government will not pay for information received in response to this RFI and is in no way obligated by the information received.
1. Summary:
AETC/DO is considering purchasing commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) ground-based spatial disorientation countermeasure trainers, termed the Advanced Spatial Awareness Trainer (ASAT). The ASAT must be capable of providing spatial disorientation (SD) illusions of both the vestibular and visual nature. Additionally, the ASAT must be capable of providing 1) routine flight simulation with momentary accelerations in the traditional six degrees of freedom (pitch, roll, yaw, heave, surge and sway) and 2) display a visual scene of at least 100 degrees horizontal and 40 degrees vertical.
2. Pre-proposal Conference and Site Visit:
A pre-proposal conference and site visit will be held after the request for proposal (RFP) is issued.
3. Pricing:
Responding vendors are requested to provide pricing data on additional pre-priced options that exceed this baseline performance specification.
4. Warranty Information:
Vendors should supply overall warranty information on their ASAT devices, parts, subassemblies, and subcomponents including parts warranted by individual manufacturers. Any expected annual maintenance costs, and any anticipated computer upgrades should also be included.
5. Basic Method of Acquisition:
AETC’s intent is open to either purchasing or leasing the device(s). We are looking to acquire a total of 6 devices as funding becomes available. It is anticipated that the follow-on purchases will take place about one year from the acceptance of the first device.
6. Governing Product Directives:
No specific MILSPEC Standards apply to this purchase, but it is anticipated that vendors should be able to show the government that similar devices have met some type of FAA flight simulator standards.
7. Specific Mandatory Specifications/Requirements/Capabilities:
a. Cab or Cockpit Configuration:
1) Cockpit Size: Any pilot candidate in the Joint Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training (JSUPT) program must be able to sit comfortably in the cockpit. In other words, if the person is of an anthropometric size to enter pilot training, then that person must be able to fit just like they would fit in the actual USAF T-6 Texan II aircraft. 
2) Seat and rudder pedals: The seat should be adjustable in forward-backward and up-down directions. It is highly desirable for the rudder pedals to be adjustable as well (forward-backward), and include the traditional aircraft toe-brake feature.
3) The cab must be light tight to produce the auto kinesis illusion. It must also contain adjustable background lighting and/or adjustable flood lights. When needed, the entire cockpit must be able to remove any background lighting, i.e. display screens must look as if they are turned off.
4) Instrumentation or head-down displays must reflect the same instrument arrangement as the T-6A aircraft, as much as possible. When this requirement cannot be met, the vendor will inform the program manager for written acceptance of the deviation. Photos of the T-6A instrument panel are attached. 
5) It is desirable that several of the instruments have interactive capability; e.g. an adjustable altimeter for changes in barometric pressure altitude, an adjustable airspeed set marker, a course set knob, and a heading set knob, etc. Standard flight simulation navigation (including instrument approaches and en-route navigation) and communication (UHF/VHF) capabilities are required.
6) Out-the-window (OTW) viewing scene: This feature is critical when producing visual illusions. It is also very important when producing flight realism. The OTW viewing scene of the virtual world must be at least 100 degrees horizontal and at least 40 degrees vertical--as measured from the eyes of the pilot when their head is in the normal sitting flight position. Larger is preferred. The scene itself must be of a high enough resolution so that it doesn't appear to be "jumpy" or partially rendered.
7) Headset: A functional, adjustable standard headset must be incorporated in the cab. Constant communication to the console operator is a requirement. Communication should be free of distortion and background noise. The console operator must be able to cut all verbal communications to the cockpit with one keystroke action.
8) Camera: An infrared camera for observing the pilot in the cab is required.
9) Night-Vision Goggle (NVG) compatibility:  A desirable feature is that of being able to use a NVG when flying the ASAT.
b. Motion Platform
1) The motion platform must be able to produce six degrees of freedom (DoF) motion--pitch, bank, yaw, heave, surge and sway. Pitch motion must be at least +/- 20 degrees from level. Bank must be at least +/- 20 degrees, and yaw must be capable of sustaining constant rotation in either direction without any limits. Total linear displacement, except heave, is not specified but the ASAT is required to produce momentary accelerations in the linear displacement directions of surge, sway and heave. These are minimum acceptable criteria.
2) Standard 220 AC (3 phase) electrical requirements are recommended, but if more (or unique power) is required, please specify in your proposal. (E.g. Line conditioning, clean power)
3) Sub-threshold motion in pitch, roll and yaw is required.
4) Facility environmental restrictions should be defined by vendor (Air conditioning, temperature limits, air flow requirements, etc)

Degree of Freedom	DisplacementRequirement	VelocityRequirement	AccelerationRequirement
Pitch	+/- 20 °	0.5 – 20 °/sec	0.5 – 60 °/sec²
Roll	+/- 20 °	0.5 – 20 °/sec	0.5 – 60 °/sec²
Yaw	Continuous	0.5 – 120 °/sec	0.5 – 10 °/sec²
Heave (if provided)	+/- 10 cm	0.5 – 40 cm/sec	Acceptable turbulence characteristics
Surge	Not specified	Not specified	Not specified
Sway	Not specified 	Not specified	Not specified
TABLE I. Motion Requirements
c. Console (workstation)
1) Color monitors for all displays at the workstation are required. The total number of displays is not specified, and the display surfaces should be shielded from overhead lights.
2) The graphical user interface should contain multiple features. Control of the imagery is critical. Features like time-of-day, in-flight visibility and associated changes of in-flight visibility (fog conditions, ceilings, in and out of cloud effects), and adjustment of runway dimensions (width/length) and sloping are all necessary. In addition, individual pre-programming of the motion is required, and pre-programming of many of the visual features should also be available. It is absolutely critical to allow for “conditional” events to occur. Conditional events are those motion and visual changes which happen at pre-determined points in space, or at a specified run time in the simulator space-time world. This important feature will be discussed further during the site visit.
3) Simulated flight and changes in the cockpit instrumentation must be controlled at the workstation. The console operator can demonstrate the flight characteristics without getting in the cab, and that any and all of the flight instruments have a feature where they can be frozen, blanked, or removed at the wish of the same console operator. These features must also be tied into the conditional event feature. The console operator must be able to either freeze an instrument whenever they desire, or an instrument can be pre-programmed to do the same thing when a conditional event is reached.
4) The console operator must be able to move the aircraft throughout the database in the traditional three dimensions (latitude, longitude, and altitude) with the aid of a cursor. Instantaneous altitude changes are also requested.
5) Recording of the total simulator profile is desired, but not required. However, the capability to display, record, and print a portion of the profile, like the ILS approach is required (in both glide slope and localizer). Please provide a list of cost options for various levels of recording capabilities.
d. Specialized Features
1) The ASAT must be able to generate acceptable SD illusions of both vestibular or visual origins and combinations of both sensory types. Acceptable illusions will be decided by the government.
2) The workstation must be able to generate formation profiles so the operator in the cab can fly with the virtual lead aircraft. Simulated air refueling is also a desired feature. So a pre-programmed tanker should be included in the data base.
3) Although the distributed mission training concept (i.e., linking several devices together via the WAN/LAN) is not a requirement, AETC would like to know about the cost of this technology.
8. Vendor Solution:
Interested vendors should propose their best solution for the above requirements and features. Because there are no specific military standards for such a device, we are hoping to work with the potential vendors to make sure they understand the different levels of importance of the listed requirements. Not all features may be required in the final product, but knowing more about the capabilities is important to the final product. We would like to better understand the vendor’s capabilities and options for both flight simulation and SD illusions. Supportability/ maintainability/reliability parameters and maintenance concepts are to be included in the proposal. First level maintenance will be done by Air Force personnel; vendors should define follow on maintenance options, e.g. on-site, on-call, etc. The requirements mentioned in this document are intended as threshold minimums. Options can be priced separately.
9. Technical Manuals, Operator and Maintenance Training
The Government will request that offerors include all applicable technical manuals and one week of on-site operations and maintenance training at Randolph AFB, TX upon delivery of the first device. Any additional training needed at the vendor’s factory, or third party site, should be mentioned in the response to the RFI. The intent is that the vendor delivers a fully functional commercial-off-the-shelf Advanced Spatial Awareness Trainer (ASAT) system. It is incumbent that the vendor identify to AETC the training plan recommendations and typical costs for that training in the response to this RFI.
10. Location/Operation Parameters:
This first device will be operated/maintained at Randolph AFB, TX by the 12th ADS. Subsequent devices will be shipped as specified by the AETC program manager.
11. Definitions:
a. Spatial Disorientation Countermeasure Trainers – a ground-based device capable of producing visual and vestibular illusions, while at the same time producing motion sensations typical of a flight simulator. Several of the specific illusions are spelled out in text Spatial Disorientation in Aviation, published by AIAA, 2004. Continual yaw motion is critical. Details will be provided if requested.
b. Flight Simulator – a ground-based device capable of producing flight simulation sensations of both motion and visual specifications. Those specifications may vary and it is recommended that vendors interested in this RFI review practices used by the FAA when certifying the motion and visual characteristics of a flight simulator. Cab motion and visual scene motion should be instantaneous, while the difference between stick inputs and cab motion should be less than 150 milliseconds. Less is better.
c. NVG capability – Using an NVG while in the flight mode is desired. The pilot should be able to look through the intensification tube when viewing the outside world and see a realistic NVG image, and look underneath the tubes while looking at and seeing the cockpit instrumentation.
12. Contracting Officer Data:
It is the Government’s intention to award to ONE contractor. All interested business concerns shall indicate interest in this acquisition by providing the company name, capabilities stated above, mailing address, phone number, and electronic mail address to the Contracting Officer.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION. This synopsis is being issued to conduct market research for small business only. This synopsis does not constitute a Request for Proposals (RFP) or an Invitation for Bids (IFB), nor does its issuance in any way restrict the Government as to its ultimate acquisition approach. The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this notice, nor will it reimburse the contractor for any costs associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice. The Mission Planning Systems Group, Battle Management Systems Wing, Electronic Systems Center (ESC), Hanscom Air Force Base, MA 01731, along with its partner organizations are seeking potential small business sources capable of software development, maintenance, and evolution for the DoD Mission Planning Enterprise. The enterprise encompasses partnering organizations in the US Air Force, Navy, Army, and SOCOM. The scope of the potential contract includes future mission planning software development, maintenance, and integration potentially for the next 4 years. These efforts may include, but are not limited to:  1. Joint Mission Planning System (JMPS) Common Capabilities development, evolution, and maintenance. 2. JMPS Aircraft and Weapon Unique Planning Components (UPCs) development, evolution, and maintenance. 3. Evolution and maintenance of the JMPS framework. 4. Migration of aircraft and weapon platforms from legacy mission planning systems to JMPS. 5. Maintenance of legacy system software - core systems, installable software modules, and/or platform components. 6. Development and evolution of future mission planning systems. 7. Performance of mission planning and related C4I trade studies and/or prototyping. 8. Operator and developer training in support of the above. The purpose of this announcement is to help the Government identify potential offerors considered to be competitive as small business MPEC prime contractors for addition to the original group of MPEC awardees.  If one or more additional small businesses are added to the contractor pool, the Government may consider small business set asides for future MPEC delivery orders under the existing MPEC contract.  On November 4th, 2004, five awards were made  to four large businesses and one small business, to share an overall ceiling of $2B over a 5-year period of performance.  A management delivery order of $250k will be issued to each of the contractors to satisfy the minimum ordering requirement and perform various tasks associated with the participation in the contract. The Government requests interested companies to submit a statement of their qualifications with respect to the criteria below; including how your qualifications will be applied to the scope of the work identified above. Responses should include examples of similar efforts. 1. Expertise/experience working within the Mission Planning domain. 2.

<DESC>The US Air Force (USAF) Air Warfare Battlelab (AWB) is exploring commercial/government off-the-shelf (COTS/GOTS) technologies that will reduce the mobility footprint and update the current inventory with modern technology in the field of cabin pressure/leakage testers.  Current Air Force testers are four-wheeled, self-contained, towable units that have been in the Air Force inventory since the early 1950s.  These units are large and require a large mobility footprint to deploy.  This technology would be used by all Air Force aircraft maintenance units as an integrated part of their aircraft maintenance procedures, whether they are deployed or operating from home station.  Current testers have an operating temperature range of -25° to 125° F and a storage range of -80° to 160° F.  Also testers are required to withstand exposure to harsh weather environments to include, but not limited to, sand, rain, snow and freezing rain.  One objective of this market survey is to determine to what extent a Next Generation Cabin Pressure Tester (NGCPT) can meet or exceed the environmental constraints imposed on today’s legacy testers.  Prospective vendors responding to this BAA should note that NGCPTs should meet the following characteristics: Output flow 10 to 400 standard cubic feet per minute (SCFM), Cabin pressure 2 to 12.5 pounds per square inch gauge (PSIG), Canopy seal flow and pressure 1 cubic foot per minute (CFM) at 65 pounds per square inch (PSI), Test medium of compressed air.  Additionally, the AWB is looking for NGCPTs that use an external air source, therefore negating the need for an operational power source.  This feature will greatly reduce the mobility footprint.  NOTICE TO FOREIGN OFFERORS: Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures and restrictions that could preclude their participation in this announcement.  SUBMISSIONS: Product Information may be submitted until COB EST 23 August 2005.  White papers should not exceed four pages plus cover letter.  Electronic responses shall be submitted in MS Word format or Adobe PDF file.  Refer technical questions and submit product information to Mr. Edward Lillion of Concurrent Technologies Corporation via email at lillione@ctc.com or by mail to 100 CTC Drive, Johnstown, PA 15904-1935.  The single point of contact concerning this Sources Sought Notice is Mr. Lillion.  You may contact Mr. Lillion with any questions you may have at (814) 269-6516.  Electronic submittals are strongly encouraged.  GENERAL BAA INFORMATION: This notice itself constitutes the BAA as per FAR 6.102(d) (2). There shall be no formal RFP.  The Air Force reserves the right to select for award, any, part of, all, or none of the proposals received.  The Air Force may or may not purchase any of the technology demonstrated.  This BAA is an expression of interest only and does not obligate the Air Force to pay any proposal preparation and prototype costs or to award any contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or other transactions.  Offerors are advised that only Air Force Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government to the obligation of funds.  For copyright purposes, offerors are also advised that submitting a proposal implies express permission for Concurrent Technologies Corporation personnel to use the data, pictures, and other information contained in the received proposals for the report back to the client.

This Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely for information and planning purposes; it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. The Government WILL NOT PAY for any information received in response to this request for information nor will the Government compensate the respondent for any cost incurred in developing the information for the Government.  Any request for copies of solicitations will not be addressed since this is a request for information, not a request for proposal.  It is requested that information in response to this RFI be submitted NO LATER THAN August 25, 2005 to Ms. Alice Tornquist, Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Code 25221B562-3, Highway 547, Lakehurst NJ 08733 or by email at alice.tornquist@navy.mil.  Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP.  Any comments provided may or may not be included in a formal solicitation.  The Government will not release any information marked with a proprietary legend received in response to this RFI to any firms, agencies or individuals outside the Government without written permission in accordance with the legend.  Respondents may provide information on any currently available product that meets the Navy’s requirements.  Respondents may also provide information on any successful product nearing the end of its Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase II development effort or items in Phase III that meet the Navy’s requirements.  SBIR items must clearly state their current status.  NAVAIR Lakehurst is requesting information pertaining to the availability of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) reliable devices to build a Navy hydrogen fueled technology demonstrator Aviation Support Vehicle (ASV).  This ASV will provide both towing and Mobile Electric Power (MEP) capabilities.  All devices must correctly function in a hostile environment (+150 degrees F to –50 degrees F @ 100% humidity in both salt spray and blowing sand as well as +/- 15 degrees of pitch and roll).  NAVAIR Lakehurst is requesting information pertaining to hydrogen fuel cells, hydrogen storage tanks (both gaseous and liquid), and accessories (required to integrate, service, and control the fuel cells and storage tanks).  The primary fuel cell must provide at least 90kva of continuous power for a minimum of 14 hours.  The operating time required is normal usage for two shifts doing continuous aircraft troubleshooting and is in no way related to the vehicle’s on-board fuel capacity.   To facilitate the use of commercial grade hydrogen, information is requested for inline purifiers to provide the fuel cell with laboratory grade (or better) hydrogen of the correct properties for use by the fuel cell.  These devices may be of any design consistent with the limited space available in any mobile USN vehicle (the ASV demonstrator).  Use of an instant start type fuel cell to act as a battery in the vehicle is planned and information is requested on these devices.  The use of this device will allow systems check at key turn and time for the main stack to come on line at full potential.  Those responding to this RFI are requested to provide available fuel consumption figures/charts, reliability (Mean-Time-Between-Failure), maintainability data, and electrical output specifics (max continuous amperage available, etc) for their units, if available.  Respondents are also requested to provide commercial pamphlets, operating and maintenance manuals or any other documentation that would describe a unit that meets the above requirements.  Respondents may provide Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) pricing for all items vetted with pricing valid FY 2005 through 2007, inclusive.  Pricing will be used for planning purposes.  Please contact Mr. Anthony Verzella, at 732-323-1511 or email anthony.verzella@navy.mil for questions regarding the technical aspects of this RFI.

<DESC>NAICS Codes: 334513 thru 334519    SOURCES SOUGHT - REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY- This is not a solicitation announcement. No contract will be awarded from this announcement. Cincinnati Procurement Operations Division (CPOD) in EPA’s Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) is conducting preliminary market research for informational purposes only to determine if there are Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSBs) that can offer a large assortment of laboratory supplies and equipment for EPA laboratories located in Ada, OK, Athens, GA, Cincinnati, OH, Corvallis, OR, Duluth, MN, Edison, NJ, Grosse Ile, MI, Gulf Breeze, FL, Las Vegas, NV, Narragansett, RI, Newport, OR, and Research Triangle Park, NC.  Based on the responses to this market research, the government will ascertain whether it will be in its best interest to establish BPAs with SDVOSBs to provide laboratory supplies and equipment.  SDVOSBs capability statements must include information that supports its ability to provide the listed products (written agreements evidencing the SDVOSB as an authorized dealer/distributor).  Also, please keep in mind that as a small business set-aside, SDVOSBs that propose to provide a product over $25,000 that it did not manufacture can only provide the product of a small business manufacturer.  FAR 19.502-2 (c) states “For small business set-asides other than for construction or services, any concern proposing to furnish a product that it did not itself manufacture must furnish the product of a small business manufacturer, unless the Small Business Administration (SBA) has granted a waiver or exception to the non-manufacturer rule...SBA has excepted procurements processed under simplified acquisitions procedures where the anticipated cost of the procurement will not exceed $25,000, from the manufacturer rule.”   The supplies and equipment listed in the capability statements will be used to determine if the EPA laboratories have a recurring need for the type of products being offered.  No feedback will be provided to companies regarding its individual capability statement.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this sources sought announcement.  The capability statements should be sent via email to sugg.ruby@epa.gov.  The due date for the capability statements is 3:00 PM on August 12, 2005.  Questions must be submitted in writing to sugg.ruby@epa.gov.

STATEMENT OF WORK
FOR
CONTAINER INVENTORY SYSTEM
25 July 05

SECTION C.1.  GENERAL.

C.1.1.  NEED.  Contractor must provide personnel, software, hardware, and other materials as required to implement a shipping container inventory system for Bagram Air Field (BAF), Afghanistan

C.1.2.	 BACKGROUND. The Joint Logistics Command (JLC) requires a shipping container inventory management system to be used for on-post container inventories and accounting at BAF.  Pending successful implementation at BAF, scope would likely expand to other logistics hubs within the CJOA.

Container management is a high priority within the Combined Joint Task Force-76 logistics area of responsibility.  To date, there are over 13,000 containers located within the CJOA and there is no automated system in place to track, inventory, and manage them.  The need exists for an inexpensive, automated, rugged, and technologically advanced system that can be incorporated within existing logistics management computer systems.  Current inventories are conducted on foot with pencil and paper and are consequently very cumbersome and manpower intensive.  Accuracy of the inventories is also limited due to normal human error and time between inventories.  

C.1.3.  PERSONNEL.

C.1.3.1.  Personnel will be employed in a dry, high desert region and must be generally healthy enough to operate under such conditions.

An updated copy must be provided to the contracting officer on the contract start date and as changes occur.

C.1.5.2.  The plan shall describe the methods for identifying and preventing defects before the level of performance becomes unacceptable.

C.1.6.	QUALITY ASSURANCE.  The government will evaluate the contractor’s performance under this contract using the method of surveillance specified at in a Technical Exhibit.  All surveillance observations will be recorded by the government.  When an observation indicates defective performance, the Contracting Officer’s Representative (COR) will obtain the contractor representative’s initials on the record of the observation.

C.1.6.1.  Performance Evaluation Meetings.  The contract manager may be required to meet periodically with the COR and contracting officer at the beginning of contract performance.  Meetings will be scheduled as needed.  The contractor may request meetings whenever a Contract Discrepancy Report is issued.   The written minutes of these meetings shall be signed by the contracting officer, and COR.  If the contractor does not concur with the minutes he shall state any areas of non-concurrence within 5 days of receipt of the signed minutes.

C.1.6.2.  Performance Requirements.  Contractor performance will be evaluated using several surveillance methods.  See Performance Requirements Summary (PRS) in technical exhibits section.

C.1.7.	HOURS OF OPERATION.

C.5.2.  GROWTH AND FLEXIBILITY.  As a new, as yet undefined requirement, the contractor must retain the ability to adapt and tailor the system as mission requirements develop and as the JLC directs.  For example, additional data fields may be added, graphic interfaces may change, maps may be adjusted, etc.

C.5.3.  LABELING.  Each individual container must be labeled with a specific, unique label or tag.  Labels must be rugged, easily replaced, heat-resistant, weather-resistant, durable, and easily accessed by inventorying personnel.  Due to the large number of containers, labels must also be inexpensive.  Roving inventory teams must have the ability to replace missing, worn, or damaged labels on-the-spot and make minor additions/modifications to the data.

C.5.4.  INVENTORIES.  The primary requirement is that at any given time, the JLC will have access to a complete, accurate inventory of containers on post at BAF.  The level of detail is initially limited to individual shipping containers and generalized cargo contained within.  Detailed inventories of container contents are not required, but could potentially be an expanded requirement.  

C.5.5.  DATA.  Some specific fields of data will be required for each individual container.  These fields will be at a minimum:  Container Number, Type (Dry, Refrigerated, Flat Rack, etc.), Location, Owner, General Contents, Date Arrived Station, and Leased/Detention.  This list of fields is not all inclusive and must be flexible to change.

C.5.6.   QUERIES.  JLC must have access to the database and have the ability to query specific details.  Queries should be easily tailored.  Examples:  a count of 20 foot, refrigerated, Class I containers located in a specific yard.

Inventory teams (US Army or KBR personnel) will conduct walk-around inspections and inventories of container yards and must have the ability to collect data and input data into the automated system on the spot.  For example, during the course of a mobile inventory, if a container is discovered to be empty, the team must be able to record the new data using hand held devices and immediately update the centralized database.  The system must allow for automated scanning of the container labels, utilizing some form of hand-held or mobile interrogator that has scan capability and data entry/modification capability.  Labels or tags on double-stacked containers must be reachable.

C.5.8.  RFID.  The system must be able to download SAVI Active Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tag data.

C.5.9.	 TRAINING.  The contractor will provide training on system use to two primary military personnel who will utilize the system on a regular basis.  Training will include management of the database, data entry, equipment use, trouble shooting, etc.  The contractor will also develop a training package to be used by the primary military personnel to train additional users.

C.5.10.  GRAPHIC REPRESENTATION.  A graphic, map-based function, showing general locations of containers on BAF grounds is required.  The graphic interface should be user friendly and should easily drill down from visual representations to data fields.  

SECTION C.6.  APPLICABLE PUBLICATIONS AND FORMS.  None.

<SUBJECT>D -- CMS' Contact Center Customer Service (CCCS) Program, Draft SOW and Presolicitation Conference
<DESC>CONTACT CENTER CUSTOMER SERVICE PROGRAM (CCCS) 
DRAFT STATEMENT OF WORK & PRESOLICITATION CONFERENCE --- 

BACKGROUND: The Contact Center Customer Service (CCCS) Program is the overarching program that will guide the creation and consolidation of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services’ (CMS) beneficiary inquiry contact centers.  These contact centers will require two main types of support: systems support and integration, and customer service-focused contact center operations.

The Contact Center Operations (CCO) and Contact Center Systems and Support (CCS) Multiple Award, Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts are the vehicles that will be used to obtain customer service functions in support of a contact center environment within CMS’ Contact Center Customer Service (CCCS) program.  Individual task orders issued under these IDIQs will be issued for specific work necessary to support the Program. These IDIQs will be competed on a full and open basis.

The CCO multiple award IDIQ will establish a pool of contractors who will compete for  task orders for beneficiary contact center operations to include training, quality assurance, program management, and other functional requirements necessary to address beneficiary telephone, written and electronic inquiries.  

The CCS multiple award IDIQ will establish a pool of contractors who will compete for task orders for beneficiary contact center systems and support activities such as systems development, systems integration, systems operations, systems maintenance, quality assurance, program management, business continuity, systems security and performance management. 

Currently CMS has customer service activities operating under task orders issued under the existing Telephone Customer Service Strategy (TCSS) IDIQ and other stand alone contracts which support various functions in addition to call center operations.  New task orders issued under the CCO and CCS multiple award IDIQs will take over the operations of ongoing customer service projects when the existing task orders/contracts end, in addition to supporting the development and implementation of new projects. 

NOTE:  CMS also intends to set aside several areas for small businesses. These include: national training development and delivery; quality assurance, beneficiary satisfaction surveys and data analysis; and, operations management to include network oversight. These will be addressed in subsequent, separate procurements. ---

DRAFT STATEMENTS OF WORK (SOW) AND PASS/FAIL CRITERIA: In an attempt to improve the understanding of CMS’ CCCS Program requirements, to allow potential offerors to judge whether or how they can satisfy the Government's requirements, and to increase efficiency in proposal preparation, proposal evaluation, negotiation, and contract award, CMS is releasing for comment draft statements of work for both the CCO and CCS IDIQs and the first task orders under each of these multiple award IDIQs (i.e., Beneficiary Contact Center (BCC) and National Data Warehouse (NDW) respectively). In addition, CMS has attached “Pass/Fail” criteria (also known as “Go – No Go”) that CMS intends to utilize in the evaluation of proposals submitted for both the CCO and CCS IDIQs. The intent of the “Pass/Fail” criteria is to provide an initial screening of proposals. Proposals that do not pass this first level screening will not be considered further in the source selection process.

CMS hopes that this early exchange of information with industry will assist with identifying and resolving concerns regarding: the acquisition strategy, including proposed contract type; acquisition planning schedules; the feasibility of the requirement, including performance requirements, “Pass/Fail” evaluation criteria, and the availability of reference documents; and, any other industry concerns or questions concerning the CCCS Program. ---

ABOUT THE PRE-SOLICITATION CONFERENCE: CMS will hold a pre-solicitation conference on Aug 09, 2005, at the CMS Single Site, 7500 Security Blvd, Baltimore, MD 21244, to explain to interested sources the CCO and CCS SOWs, the BCC and NDW task order SOWs, and the acquisition strategy.  The conference will be held in the CMS auditorium and will start at 9:00 a.m. Attendees may check in at the registration table outside of the auditorium beginning at 8:00 a.m. It is anticipated that the conference will run to approximately 3:30 p.m. Organizations wishing to attend the conference must pre-register by Aug 01, 2005, and may do so by sending an E-mail to CCO@cms.hhs.gov .

As part of the site preparation, three (3) runs of buried 4-inch PVC conduit will be installed between the GATR building and each of the new towers to facilitate the installation of the new cables.  Tower # 4 will have four (4) PVC runs, since additional frequencies will be in use on this tower.

In determining the best value to the Government, the tradeoff process of evaluation will be used.  This process permits tradeoffs among cost or price and non-cost factors, and allows the Government to consider award to other than the lowest priced offeror or other than the highest technically rated offeror.  In making the source selection determination, the Government is concerned with achieving the most favorable balance between technical merit and cost factors. This may result in an award to a technically acceptable, higher priced offeror where the Government reasonably determines the technical superiority of the higher priced offeror outweighs any cost or price difference.  While the Government will strive for maximum objectivity, the source selection process, by its nature, is subjective and, therefore, professional judgment is implicit throughout the entire process.  Proposals will be evaluated based solely on the factors contained in this solicitation.  PRICE IS CONSIDERED EQUAL TO TECHNICAL FACTORS.  THE TECHNICAL FACTORS ARE WEIGHTED, AS FOLLOWS:  Technical Approach: 40%; Technical Qualifications: 35%; Past Performance: 25%.

<DESC>On behalf of the African Development Foundation (ADF), an agency of the United States Government, the Bureau of the Public Debt is issuing a combined synopsis/solicitation for a personal services contract for a Performance Management Specialist. 

The Performance Management Specialist shall 1) improve the quality of ADF’s partner development support, country program and project development, project implementation support; and 2) improve ADF’s internal processes to measure organization performance, provide quality customer service and accurate, timely information to its internal and external customers.

The ADF is an independent corporation of the United States Government.  Its mandate is to foster community-based development in Africa.  ADF programs focus on: 1) assisting indigenous small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) to engage in profitable and sustainable local, regional and international trade, 2) responding to the priority needs of grassroots communities and marginalized groups, and 3) documenting, promoting and disseminating best practices related to enterprise development and community based participatory development.  ADF currently provides community reinvestment grants and conventional grants to indigenously owned businesses and non-governmental organizations in fifteen African countries.

ADF is currently recasting its five-year strategy to develop new programming emphases that are more responsive to priority needs and opportunities of African small and medium-sized enterprises and grassroots communities. In addition, ADF is in the midst of a comprehensive business process analysis and a realignment of its organizational structure and business model to improve its operating efficiency. These efforts will culminate in the development and implementation of a Balanced Scorecard or similar comprehensive performance measurement strategy and strategic management system.  

The contractor will reports directly to ADF’s President and will provide products, management support and professional advice related to: 1) implementation of the new strategic plan of the agency, 2) translating ADF’s strategic goals and objectives into departmental and individual performance plans for targeting, measuring and achieving high impact results, 3) instituting a strategic management system and comprehensive performance measurement strategy incorporating all ADF operating units in Washington and overseas, 4) ensuring efficient and cost–effective integration of divisional operations, and 5) developing and nurturing a dynamic organizational culture that embraces growth, accountability for results, operational efficiency, new ways of thinking, transparency and integrity. 

During FY05, ADF has begun work on several strategic tasks, including the identification of draft performance measures and performance management processes, organizationally linked programmatic goals and measures.  These efforts are part of a process to create an ADF-wide ‘results structure’ that can be submitted with the FY07 OMB and Congressional budget presentations and used to describe and distinguish the value and successes of ADF’s mission, programs and activities. The culmination of these efforts will be the development and implementation of a Balanced Scorecard (BSC) performance management structure. 

ADF recognizes that performance management is a long-term effort that will require further development and continued communications throughout ADF to ensure that new practices are adopted and consistently applied in the long term. 

All activities during FY05---will focus on organizational transformation and foundational performance management efforts launched in FY2005. 
1.	Providing training and communication to support the initiation of a results-based performance culture, focused on the development of more compelling, complete and consistent program presentations;

2.	Refining ADF organization wide performance goals, measures and priorities to support ADF’s ability to develop and implement world-class programs and projects;

3.	Implementing bench mark performance metrics across all ADF operating entities to increase program accountability and effectiveness at all levels of ADF’s operational and program activities;

3.	Assisting ADF in identifying best measures for reducing high cost, high workload and duplicative management activities within ADF/W and across ADF’s field country operations.

The Specialist shall work at the corporate offices in Washington, DC and travel to ADF offices in Africa or any other designated areas as necessary for the successful completion of the Statement of Work (SOW).  Local travel performed, including to and from the National Capitol Region (NCR), is considered the cost of doing business.

ADF seeks to:

The objective is to develop these measures in cooperation with ADF division directors, country representatives and country partners, to implement them so that they are effectively collected and used, and to assist in the analysis of measures to identify opportunities for further process improvement;

2.  Improve the quality of its Congressional and OMB budget submissions and supporting documentation.  The foundation for significant change has been put into place through the analysis and support done to date.  Continued work will be needed to develop ADF’s capacity to consistently develop compelling budget submissions and business cases for specific programs and systems.  The objective is the implementation and continuing use of clear, effective processes at the corporate, division and country level that result in ADF programs receiving positive support from funding authorities; and 

3.  Continue to improve its internal processes to provide quality customer service and accurate, timely information to its external and internal customers.  Relative to its external customers, ADF seeks assistance in refining its strategic programs and management processes to ensure they are: a) consistent with USG priorities, b) responsive to the development needs and opportunities of SMEs and grassroots communities in Africa, c) complementary with priorities of Host governments and ADF’s strategic partners, and d) approximating or exceeding best practices and benchmark standards of those considered as “best of class”.

2.	Determine success factors tied to goals stated on existing ADF Strategic Framework;

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.   The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman.     Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.     If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.   Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.   Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.     In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.   Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.     This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG851), 2100 2ND Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D.C., 20593, Telephone:  202-267-2285
Fax:  202-267-4011.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011. Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit quotations that will be considered by the agency.  Quotations should be written and submitted in a legible format.  Submitted quotes shall have the contractor’s Tax Information Number, and DUNS Number.

ITEM DESCRIPTION

This requirement is for a quantity of six (6) forensic workstations per the attached salient characteristics.

INSTRUCTIONS TO VENDORS

Along with your price quotation, you must submit technical literature in order for the government to verify that your products are technically acceptable in accordance with the minimum salient characteristics in this RFQ.

GENERAL:

Past Performance: (Past performance is a measure of how well a company performed under previous opportunities.)  The Government intends to make a subjective assessment of how well the contractor(s) has performed in the past The Government’s policy is to use information about a contractor’s past performance when making its determination on which GSA contractor represents the best value and lowest overall cost alternative.  This policy is based on the notion that a contractor’s past experience and record of satisfying its customers in the past is indicative, though not necessarily determinative, of the likelihood that it will do so in the future.  Therefore, vendors shall submit the following references in order to assist the Government in making its best value determination. 

Experience:  (Experience is the opportunity to learn by doing and previous opportunities indicate the breadth, depth and relevance of a company’s abilities.)  The Government intends to make a subjective assessment of the ability of the contractor(s) based on their past experiences with similar requirements.  The ability of the contractor(s) to perform this requirement correlates to the degree of risk for non-performance the Government will be exposed to. The vendor must have experience in providing forensic workstations within the past three years. 

The vendor shall provide three (3) references, including company/agency name, contact person, and phone number. 
The vendor shall provide the following additional information:
•	Federal Tax ID Number:
•	GSA Schedule Contract Number:
•	Tax ID:
•	DUNS Number:
•	Expiration date of GSA schedule

SECTION 508:

1.	Requirements for Section 508 Evaluation Template

Any products and/or services the Government intends to acquire based on this RFQ must allow the Government to support its obligations under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.  The text of the applicable standards, are identified in Attachment number two to this RFQ.

A completed Section 508 Evaluation Template (see http://www.ssa.gov/oag/acq/oagacq_508.htm) will be required for each product and service indicated in the statement of work.  In cases where a service is being purchased (e.g., Contractor Support Services), the contractor shall complete any sections of the template that correspond to the service’s provided “deliverables”.  Items that qualify as “deliverables” would be presentations, troubleshooting manuals, user guides, training information, etc.

When a contractor completes the Section 508 Evaluation Template they must state exactly how their product/service does or does not meet the applicable Section 508 standards.  Merely stating that a product/service is compliant or noncompliant with the applicable Section 508 standards, without explicitly stating how, may result in that product/service being removed from consideration in the award of the contract.  Contractors are cautioned to address each standard individually and with specificity.

Contractors will also find a link to “SSA’s Guide to Completing a Section 508 Evaluation Template” at the site indicated above for a completed Section 508 Evaluation Template.  

2.	Instructions Relative to Accessible Product Documentation

The Social Security Administration (SSA) requires that all documentation provided with a product be in an electronic accessible format.  In order for SSA to adequately evaluate this documentation, please provide this documentation labeled "accessible documentation" on a separate CD, in an appropriately labeled folder with the product, or through a link to a web site where the link specifies the accessible documentation separate from the standard documentation. If the standard documentation provided commercially is already in an accessible format please state that explicitly in your response.

3.	Instructions Relative to Section 508 Standards and Equivalent Facilitation     
  
To be considered eligible for award, contractors must propose products and/or services that meet the applicable provisions of the Section 508 standards as identified by the Agency.  Alternatively, contractors may propose products and/or services that provide equivalent facilitation.  Equivalent facilitation is a recognition that technologies may be either developed or used in ways not envisioned by the technical provisions in Attachment two, but still result in the same or better functional access as would be provided by strictly meeting the provisions in Attachment two.  Functional outcome, not form, is the key to evaluating whether a technology results in “substantially equivalent or greater access.”

If a contractor proposes to meet Section 508 standards in this manner, they must address Section 1194.31, Functional Performance Criteria, of Section 508.  Furthermore, any associated costs must be identified.

Such quotes will be considered to have met the provisions of the Section 508 standards as identified in Attachment two, for the feature or component providing equivalent facilitation.

4.	SSA’s Right to Perform Testing on a Contractor’s Product

SSA reserves the right to perform testing on a contractor’s product in order to ensure the accuracy of their documentation regarding Section 508 and SSA’s accessibility requirements.  If requested, the contractor will provide SSA with a copy of the product being considered for purchase so that we may validate any of their claims of accessibility within our own testing lab.  The product being provided for testing purposes must be equivalent to the final commercially available release version in terms of functionality and features.  Demonstration and/or Trial versions of a product, therefore, will NOT be considered for testing purposes.  This is necessary since limits imposed in the functionality and features would detract from accurate testing of a product’s “level of compliance” with Section 508 and SSA’s accessibility requirements.  In addition to the actual product, any documentation (i.e. training guides, user manuals, etc.) and a Test Plan illustrating a “typical” user scenario(s) must be included in order to ensure fair and accurate testing by SSA.

Upon award, the product(s) provided for testing by all unsuccessful contractors will be returned, at the contractor’s expense.  The successful contractor’s product(s) will be retained and will be accounted for in any resultant order, if applicable.  If an order is not imminent, the successful contractor’s products(s) shall also be returned, at the contractor’s expense.

5.	Contents of Quotation 

Technical:  

For each product offered, the contractor must discuss how each mandatory requirement or specification is met.  This is especially true for the SSA’s Accessibility Standards and Section 508 Accessibility Standards.

If this acquisition is for a product(s), contractors are requested to submit hard copy technical publications, glossy brochures, etc. regarding the characteristics of the proposed product(s) to support their compliance with the requirements contained in this RFQ.

If this acquisition is for services, or contains service requirements, the contractor shall provide written acknowledgement for each requirement stating that they have read and agree to comply with the requirements stated.  As applicable, contractors must also indicate how each requirement shall be met and identify the service provider.

Cost:

The contractor shall break out any additional costs which may be associated with meeting the requirements of Section 508 or SSA’s Accessibility Requirements which are not incorporated in the tables.

EVALUATION METHODOLOGY AND RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF EVALUATION FACTORS

    Contractors will be evaluated by following the step process outlined below.

•	First, the quoted product(s) will be evaluated to determine if they are technically acceptable, which means that the offered product(s) must meet all mandatory technical specifications.  As part of this step, in addition to reviewing the contractor’s written description of how the offered products meet the technical specifications, the Government may perform a hands-on technical evaluation to independently verify the technical acceptability of the offered products.  

•	Second, provided an offer meets all of the technical requirements, product(s) shall then be evaluated for compliance with the applicable requirements of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act and SSA’s Accessibility Requirements. The evaluation will consist of reviewing the information in the contractor’s response and utilizing the document, entitled “SSA Guide to Applying Section 508 Standards,” to determine compliance (refer to http://www.ssa.gov/oag/acq/oagacq_508.htm). The evaluation may also include a hands-on evaluation, which SSA will conduct using an internally developed evaluation system to assess the product’s “level of compliance” with Section 508 and SSA’s Accessibility Requirements.

Award will be made to the contractor who is fully 508 compliant (including SSA’s Accessibility Requirements).  If more than one contractor quotes fully 508 compliant products in this manner, SSA will conduct the best value analysis set forth in the third step below to determine which of the fully 508 compliant quotes will receive the award.

If there are no fully 508-compliant quotes as described above, SSA will award to the most 508-compliant quote.  If a hands-on evaluation is used, most compliant will be determined according to the internally developed evaluation system.

If there are two or more contractors whose responses are considered to be equally 508 compliant (as described above), SSA will conduct the best value analysis set forth in the third step below to distinguish between those equally 508 compliant quotes.  
  
NOTE:

(1) Award will not be made to a contractor meeting all or some of the applicable Section 508 standards if award would impose an undue burden upon the Agency.

•	Third, in the event two or more contractors are considered equally Section 508 compliant as described above, award will be made to the contractor whose solution represents the best value considering price and other factors in accordance with FAR Subparts 8.404 and 8.405.

<DESC>Amendment-03 for Solicitation RFQ-NCI-50061-NV is being issued to answer questions received from an interested vendor.  The due date for proposal is changed to August 8, 2005 at 1:00PM EDT.

Question 1:

The Amendment Question 1 indicates 1-OHP: 0.1 ng/L (urine volume 0.5mL) and MDA: 0.05 umol/L (50 uL urine).  I wanted to make sure these numbers are accurate, they seem very low.

Answer 1:

Below are the correct values (detection limits and sample amount) for the four measurements.

1-OHP:  1 ng/L (urine volume: 0.5 mL)

2-naphthol:  0.5 ng/ml (0.5 mL urine)

MDA:  0.1 umol/L (50 ul urine)

8-OHdG:  0.5 ng/ml (50 ul urine)

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation to procure the analysis of 1000 urine samples for two PAH metabolites (1-OHP, 2-naphthol) and two oxidative stress markers (8-OHdG, MDA). The services herein are commercial as defined in FAR Part 2, and this acquisition is being made in accordance FAR 12  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will NOT be issued.  This solicitation RFQ-NCI-50061-NV includes all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through FAR FAC 2005-04.  

The North American Industry Classification code is 541380, and the business size standard is $6M.  This solicitation is NOT set-aside for small businesses.

BACKGROUND:  PAHs have shown to cause mammary cancer in experimental animals. Some epidemiological studies have shown significant associations between breast cancer and occupational exposure to PAHs, active and passive smoking, and consumption of well-done meats which contains high levels of PAHs.  Although these are potentially important exposures for breast cancer, the evidence is not clear.  Exposure assessment for epidemiologic studies is based on information from interviews.  Measurements of urinary PAH metabolites in subjects with PAHs exposure in an epidemiological study would reduce misclassification of exposure and provide information on total PAH exposure.  Simultaneous measurements of 1-OHP and 2-naphthol would, therefore, provide better understanding of the total, as well as route-specific, PAH exposure and help clarify the relation of these chemicals with the risk of breast cancer.  There is growing interest in the role of oxidative stress from chemicals like these and breast cancer development because of cross-talk between oxidative stress and hormonal imbalance.  There are, however, a limited number of population-based studies of oxidative stress and breast cancer.  Among several biomarkers of oxidative stress, 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and malondiadelyde (MDA) are most frequently used because of their biological importance and the sensitivity of the assay.

CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS:  The contractor shall perform the following tasks on 1000 urine samples sent all at one time:  1) Analyze 1000 urine samples for 1-OHP;  2) Analyze 1000 urine samples for 2-naphthol;  3) Analyze 1000 urine samples for 8-OHdG; 4) Analyze 1000 urine samples for MDA; and 5) Provide results of the analyses in an Excel spreadsheet to the Project Officer containing sample ID, test-date, test results and if applicable, quality control data. GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBILITES:  NCI will ship the 1000 urine samples on dry ice. Samples will be coded and will not have any personal identifiers attached.

EVALUATION CRITERIA:  Offers will be evaluated based on the following technical criteria.  The technical portion 	of the proposal will receive paramount consideration in selecting a vendor.  However, price will also be a significant factor in the event that two or more vendors are determined to be essentially equal following the evaluation of technical factors.  1)  Technical Approach – 50% proposed methods for measurements of urinary metabolites of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and biomarkers of oxidative stress must be sound and fully described. The proposed approach must be consistent with the stated goals and objectives of the Statement of Work i.e., measurements for 2 biomarkers of PAH metabolites and 2 biomarkers of oxidative stress.  2)  Experience  - 40% the proposed staff must have experience in conducting analyses described in the Statement of Work, including similar efforts,  Measurements of urinary metabolites of PAHs and oxidative stress for groups of Chinese women and children is a plus.   3)	Understanding of the problem – 10% must demonstrate that the proposed approach, including appropriateness of allocation and effort of proposed personnel and allocation of resources, is sufficient to accomplish the tasks in the Statement of Work.

No, a detailed discussion of your company’s hiring and personnel procedures is not required. However, your quotation should designate a project officer and provide sufficient details, i.e., resume, of the project officer’s related experience and ability to meet DHS’s requirements.
 
9.        Will you require a detailed discussion of insurance, lease and rental agreements? 

No, the work is to be done at the contractor’s primary place of business. The vendor should provide only sufficient detail of its business operations to demonstrate its capability to perform DHS’s requirement. 
 
10.      Will you require a detailed discussion and accounting for the equipment necessary to produce the services? 

No, DHS has a requirement for the news clipping services. The vendor should provide only sufficient detail on equipment or other resources to demonstrate its capability for providing those services.

11.      Will you require a detailed discussion and accounting of the method of production and delivery of services? 

The vendor should discuss the method of production and delivery of services in sufficient detail to demonstrate its capability for and approach to fulfilling DHS’s requirement.  Under commercial practices (FAR Part 12) accounting information is not required on a firm fixed price contract.

As stated in the RFQ, FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications, applies to this solicitation and should be submitted as part of the quotation package. See www.arnet.gov/far.  Additionally, vendors are required to be registered in the Central Contractor Registration System and business size documented.

13.	How soon would you expect to award the contract and when would work begin?   

Award will be made as soon as the technical evaluation has been completed.  Work is expected to begin August 9, 2005.  

14.	Would you consider a small business whose principal had the expertise and hired additional staffers to support the needs of the contract?   

Yes

15.	Are points given to candidates for consideration and what are the criteria for evaluation?  

As stated in the RFQ, award will be made using the best value analysis. Specific evaluation criteria are outlined in the original FEDBIZOPPS announcement.  Quotations should provide sufficient information to evaluate (1) capability/ability/approach for fulfilling DHS requirement (2) experience/past performance (include references for relevant past experience and (3) Price.

16.	Do you have an existing clipping service contract with a larger firm currently?    

Yes 

18.  Is this an RFQ against an existing contract (i.e., GSA Schedule)?    

No

19.	 How much has been budgeted for this effort?

The budget estimate is for internal use and based upon some initial  market research.

20.	 Can you provide a list of critical sources?

Multiple media sources will be required.  The Department of Homeland Security is covered by thousands of regional, national and international radio, television, newspapers, magazines, trade publications and internet sources.  Because DHS has a diverse portfolio of responsibilities, all of these sources are critical for different reasons.  The Department of Homeland Security is requesting a news service that can compile news coverage from these thousands of sources and edit them into a non-redundant product daily.

21.	 Are continuously updated sources like new wires important?

Continuous updates are not critical, but they are helpful.  The RFQ requests two comprehensive products, one at 5:00 am and one at 7:00 am.  However, the Department of Homeland Security would consider  quotations from vendors that offer continuous updates as an added value.

  
22.  Is there a requirement for global content?

Yes.  International partnerships are an important part of the homeland security mission.  Department of Homeland Security officials frequently travel abroad to discuss issues of mutual concern.  We require international news both in preparation for travel and to gauge public response to meetings after they occur.


23.	How will you handle copyright compliance issues for redistribution of content to the 200,000 expected users?

We expect the vendor to provide a copyright compliance solution.  All Department of Homeland Security employees should have access to news about their work, so it is important that the news product be available to all of them.

24.  Would DHS consider opening up the procurement to companies other  than small businesses?

No.

25.  Due to the nature of the work, most media-monitoring companies don’t price by the hour.  This was a firm-fixed price contract when last awarded.  Will DHS consider continuing the firm-fixed pricing model to receive bids from companies that use it?

This will be a firm-fixed price contract for base year plus two option years.

26.	Do you want both video and transcripts of the television news? 

Transcripts are not required, but quotations offering transcripts will be considered as an added value. 

27.	Do you want both audio and transcripts of the radio news? 

Transcripts are not required, but proposals offering transcripts will be considered as an added value.

28.	How long will you want video and audio materials to remain in retrievable form?   Must we store audio and video clips indefinitely? 

DHS wants each day’s news clips archived for 30 days.

29. Each day, the summaries, clips, and other information will be made available to DHS electronically, and each day the website will change entirely as new content is added. Do you want all materials continuously available on the website for the duration of the contract?

 We would like each day’s news clips archived for the next 30 days.  

Or would you like content burned to CD and delivered to you in hard form? 

No CD required

30.		Most of the language in the solicitation deals with “national” news. Regarding “international” news, it appears that you are asking for access to sources of international news and not clippings and summaries of international news. All news broadcast in the U.S. will be filtered, sorted, and summarized, including international news; do you also want international news sources like the BBC to be filtered, sorted, and summarized according to the criteria of the solicitation? 

Yes, international news sources are an important part of the requirement.

31. 	Do you have a list of trade journals that you want covered? 

National Journal, Congress Daily, Congressional Quarterly, CQ Homeland Security Edition, Federal Times, Roll Call, Aviation Week, Wall Street Journal, Financial Times, Legal Times.  Others are welcome.

32. Can non-small business bid on this opportunity?   

As stated in the combined synopsis/solicitation, this acquisition is 100% set aside for small business. 

33. Does FEMA require full reprints of media hits or summaries with direct links (which may be changed by the news agencies)?

This is not a FEMA procurement – this requirement is for Department of Homeland Security Headquarters.  

34.	If FEMA desires full story reprint rights, for what percentage of all articles does FEMA anticipate needing full reprint rights?

See #33.

NO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS WILL BE ACCEPTED.

6 		PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE

USTDA seeks to hire a definitional mission team to investigate potential industrial and municipal wastewater treatment project opportunities in Nigeria and Senegal.  Recent trips to the two countries conducted by USTDA Sub-Saharan Africa staff have resulted in several requests for consideration of USTDA funding for wastewater projects.  The definitional mission will analyze both direct requests made to USTDA for funding assistance and opportunities that may be discovered during the informational gathering and in-country travel stages of the definitional mission.  The selected DM consultant will be expected to travel to Nigeria and Senegal in the fall of 2005.  The DM consultant will meet with the Lagos Water Corporation and L’Office National de l’Assainissement (ONAS), as well as other governmental entities, parastatals, and/or private companies the DM consultant and COTR deem appropriate.  The U.S. Embassies in each country are supportive of this proposed USTDA definitional mission.

Nigeria

Although wastewater treatment and sanitation issues abound throughout Nigeria, the principal problems are found in Lagos.  Lagos, with an estimated population of 15 million, is one of the largest cities in the world.   The metropolitan area is a group of islands endowed with creeks and a lagoon.   The large expanse of water around Lagos is not potable and does not meet World Health Organization standards.  Due to inadequate sewage treatment much of the city's human waste is disposed of by the drainage of rainwater through open ditches that discharge into the Lagos lagoon or tidal flats.  

Only 5% of the inhabitants of Lagos are connected to wastewater treatment plants.  The existing plants do not treat the wastewater to acceptable standards, and are poorly maintained and operated. The existing wastewater system is served by a central plant with primary treatment.  The bulk of municipal and industrial wastewater is being discharged directly, untreated into water courses or the lagoon.  Open storm water drains are common and in many cases act as open sewers.        

The lagoon has been turned into a large refuse dump into which raw sewage, feces, industrial waste and other kinds of garbage are dumped.  Those responsible include the sawmills, pesticide-producing plants and other industries located near the lagoon as well as factories in far-away locations. Experts have established a relationship between the cholera and typhoid epidemics that often occur in Lagos and the pollution of the lagoon. The polluted lagoon accounts for the bulk of fresh water fish and other seafood consumed daily by the population of Lagos. 

A recent World Bank study reported that $2.5 billion will be needed over the next twenty years to meet the growing need for water treatment projects in Nigeria.  The majority of these funds will be utilized for new facilities, however rehabilitation of existing facilities and maintenance costs are also part of the estimated figure required.  Although clearly all of the needed projects will not be implemented, it can be expected that with significant World Bank support, many will.  The World Bank water program in Nigeria addresses two main areas of need: (a) a decaying infrastructure and insufficient investment; and (b) improved management and operational effectiveness in provision of services.  Major project focus areas that have been identified include: industrial wastewater source treatment, municipal wastewater treatment facilities, and storm water drainage networks. 

The definitional mission will investigate possible roles for USTDA’s assistance in the overall wastewater sector in Nigeria.  Potential activities could include the privatization efforts of the Lagos Water Corporation by the GON, involvement with development activities involved with on-site industrial and municipal wastewater treatment projects, and technical assistance in developing strengthened institutional enforcement capacity.   

Senegal

By 2015, it is estimated that Dakar’s population, currently 2 million, will grow to over 5 million.  Today, half of the population of Dakar has access to primary wastewater treatment, and the goal is that by 2015, this figure will be over 85%.  Dakar also has the Camberene Wastewater Treatment Plant, a modern wastewater treatment facility, with both primary and secondary treatment, and utilization of biogas for 25% of the facility’s energy requirements.  The plant services roughly 200,000 homes.  Expansion plans, for which Agence Francaise de Developpement (AFD) already has funded a feasibility study, will build out the capacity to serve an additional 100,000 homes.  

In February 2005, the Government of Senegal published a report titled, “Strategy and Action Plan for Implementing the Millennium Goals for Sanitation in Senegal.”  This report is part of a larger report on water challenges for the country.   The water sanitation plan divides itself into rural and urban components.  The plan calls for: (1) the rehabilitation of existing treatment stations; (2) construction of new treatment stations in the peri-urban zones of Dakar, utilizing best available technologies; (3) a new interceptor project for the Corniche Ouest area of Dakar that will involve primary treatment before releasing effluent into the ocean; and, (4) a de-pollution project for the bay of Hann.  

L’Office National de l’Assainissement (ONAS), which is the GOS entity responsible for wastewater issues, plans to privatize certain elements of its operations by 2007.

The definitional mission will investigate possible roles for USTDA’s assistance in the overall wastewater sector in Senegal.  Potential activities could include the privatization efforts of ONAS by the GOS, involvement with activities associated with on-site industrial and municipal wastewater treatment projects, and technical assistance in developing strengthened institutional enforcement capacity.   
 
Annex I

IMPACT ON U.S. LABOR STATEMENT

The Foreign Operations, Export Financing and Related Programs Appropriations legislation restricts U.S. foreign assistance from being used to provide: (a) any financial incentive to a business enterprise currently located in the United States for the purpose of inducing such an enterprise to relocate outside the United States if such incentive or inducement is likely to reduce the number of employees of such business enterprise in the United States because United States production is being replaced by such enterprise outside the United States; (b) assistance for any project or activity that contributes to the violation of internationally recognized workers rights; and (c) direct assistance for establishing or expanding production of any commodity for export by any country other than the United States, if the commodity is likely to be in surplus on world markets at the time the resulting productive capacity is expected to become operative and if the assistance will cause substantial injury to United States producers of the same, similar, or competing commodity. 

 
Annex II

USTDA Nationality Requirements

The purpose of USTDA's nationality, source, and origin requirements is to assure the maximum practicable participation of American contractors, technology, equipment and materials in the pre-feasibility, feasibility, and implementation stages of a project.


USTDA STANDARD RULE (GRANT AGREEMENT STANDARD LANGUAGE):

Except as USTDA may otherwise agree, the following provisions shall govern the delivery of goods and services funded by USTDA under this Grant Agreement: (a) for professional services, the Contractor must be either a U.S. firm or U.S. consultant; (b) the Contractor may use U.S. subcontractors without limitation, but the use of subcontractors from host country may not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the USTDA Grant amount and may only be used for specific services from the Terms of Reference identified in the subcontract; (c) employees of U.S. Contractor or U.S. subcontractor firms responsible for professional services shall be U.S. citizens or non-U.S. citizens lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S.; (d) goods purchased for implementation of the Study and associated delivery services (e.g., international transportation and insurance) must have their nationality, source and origin in the United States; and (e) goods and services incidental to Study support (e.g., lodging, food, and transportation) in host country are not subject to the above restrictions. USTDA will make available further details concerning these standards of eligibility upon request.

NATIONALITY:
1.	Rule

Except as USTDA may otherwise agree, the Contractor for USTDA funded activities must be either a U.S. firm or a U.S. consultant. Prime contractors may utilize U.S. subcontractors, but the use of host country subcontractors is limited to 20% of the USTDA grant amount.
2.	Application

Accordingly, only a U.S. firm or U.S. consultant may submit proposals on USTDA-funded activities. Although those proposals may include subcontracting arrangements with host country firms or individuals for up to 20% of the USTDA grant amount, they may not include subcontracts with third country entities. U.S. firms submitting proposals must ensure that the professional services funded by the USTDA grant, to the extent not subcontracted to host country entities, are supplied by employees of the firm or employees of U.S. subcontractor firms who are U.S. individuals. 

Interested U.S. firms and consultants who submit proposals must meet USTDA nationality requirements as of the due date for the submission of proposals and, if selected, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. These nationality provisions apply to whatever portion of the Terms of Reference is funded with the USTDA grant. 
3.	Definitions

A "U.S. individual" is (a) a U.S. citizen, or (b) a non-U.S. citizen lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S. (a green card holder).

A "U.S. consultant" is (a) a U.S. citizen whose principal place of business is in the United States, or (b) a non-U.S. citizen lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S. (a green card holder) whose principal place of business is in the U.S.

A "U.S. firm" is a privately owned firm which is incorporated in the U.S., with its principal place of business in the U.S., and which is either (a) more than 50% owned by U.S. individuals, or (b) has been incorporated in the U.S. for more than three (3) years prior to the issuance date of the request for proposals; has performed similar services in the U.S. for that three (3) year period; employs U.S. citizens in more than half of its permanent full-time positions in the U.S.; and has the existing capability in the U.S. to perform the work in question. 

A partnership, organized in the U.S. with its principal place of business in the U.S., may also qualify as a "U.S. firm" as would a joint venture organized or incorporated in the United States consisting entirely of U.S. firms and/or U.S. individuals.

A nonprofit organization, such as an educational institution, foundation, or association may also qualify as a "U.S. firm" if it is incorporated in the United States and managed by a governing body, a majority of whose members are U.S. individuals.
SOURCE AND ORIGIN:
1.	Rule

In addition to the nationality requirement stated above, any goods (e.g., equipment and materials) and services related to their shipment (e.g., international transportation and insurance) funded under the USA Grant Agreement must have their source and origin in the United States, unless USTDA otherwise agrees. However, necessary purchases of goods and project support services which, are unavailable from a U.S. source (e.g., local food, housing and transportation) are eligible without specific USTDA approval.
2.	Application

Accordingly, the prime contractor must be able to demonstrate that all goods and services purchased in the host country to carry out the Terms of Reference for a USTDA Grant Agreement that were not of U.S. source and origin were unavailable in the United States. 
3.	Definitions

"Source" means the country from which shipment is made.

"Origin" means the place of production, through manufacturing, assembly or otherwise.
Questions regarding these nationality, source and origin requirements may be addressed to the USTDA Office of General Counsel by calling (703) 875-4357.

<DESC>The proposal submittal date for W912PQ-05-R-0008 is extended until July 29, 2005 @ 3:00 P.M. EST. Questions/Clarifications Please clarify what is expected of the contractor electrically.  At the walk thru, it was mentioned that we will be providing conduits & power wiring from the turnstiles to the nearest building and that the Government would be responsible for all work from  this point back to the panel to provide power to the unit.  On the unit itself we would only be responsible for hooking up the walkway lights.  It was also mentioned that the government would pull all control wiring and hook up all control points in the h ead mechanism that the turnstile may require. I am assuming that two of the four conduits for the front turnstile will be used for power.  Is this correct? Do the bollards have individual footings or should the footings or should the footing be continuous connect the bollards? Creating a large footing connecting multiple bollards is what Leda describes as the preferable method of installation. Will the cost estimate spreadsheet be provided to input pricing? Responses:    ·Question 1: I am assuming that two of the four conduits for the front turnstile will be used for power.  Is this correct?
