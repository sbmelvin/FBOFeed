<DESC>The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), intends to negotiate a base year with four (4) one-year option periods for the toxicology analysis of samples obtained from various railroad employees subject to FRA?s mandatory Post-Accident Toxicology Testing Program as implemented pursuant to Title 49 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 219 Control of Alcohol and Drug Use.  To be eligible for award, a prospective offeror must have prior to award, Department of Health and Human Services/Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (DHHS/SAMHSA) certification for the laboratory proposed and licensure under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA).  The FRA requires special testing of rail crews to determine if drugs or alcohol were either a primary or contributing cause to a significant rail accident or incident.  Samples are collected by carrier-selected medical facilities using FRA mandatory post-accident split-sample toxicology kits.  Specimens include urine and whole blood for surviving crew members, and urine, whole blood, and tissue for deceased crew members.  Samples are analyzed by utilizing FRA-established cut-offs in urine and whole blood, and results obtained must be scientifically sound and legally defensible.  This program does not fall under 49 CFR Part 40 authority, it is specifically excluded.  Analyses of specimen sets from approximately 250 employees after 80 ? 100 events are projected for each performance period (base & options) under the anticipated contract.  The successful offeror?s laboratory must be capable of the following: (A) Receiving and preserving specimen sets 24 hours a day, seven days a week, either at its laboratory or through some other FRA-approved, forensically acceptable manner.  (B) Accessioning specimens and implementing strict chain-of-custody procedures.  (C) Analyzing specimen sets based on FRA-approved screening and confirmatory protocols.  Urines are to be screened for drugs of interest by an approved immunoassay (e.g. KIMS, EIA, RIA or FPIA).  Presumptive drug positives are to be confirmed in urine by Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS).  The corresponding whole blood is to be evaluated by GC/MS for any confirmed urine positive drug group.  Where no acceptable urine sample exists, the laboratory must have the capability to directly screen the whole blood using an acceptable immunoassay procedure.  For deceased crew members, the laboratory must also have the capability to screen and confirm for the presence of drugs and alcohol in various other body fluids and tissues, including vitreous, brain, liver, etc.  Whole blood samples will always be directly evaluated by headspace Gas Chromatography (or equivalent) for the presence of ethyl alcohol.  The laboratory will also be responsible for screening/testing of adulterants and substitutions consistent with DHHS/SAMHSA guidelines.  For negative drug screens (regardless of the alcohol results), reports are to be issued as a group, no later than three working days after receipt of samples of surviving crew members, and five working days where one or more fatalities are involved.  For cases with presumptive positive on screening tests, reports are to be issued as a group, no later than ten days after receipt of samples.  Prospective offerors failing to meet the certification, licensure, and/or technical capability requirements identified in the solicitation will not be considered.  As of the release/posting of this notice, it is anticipated that on or about November 28, 2006 the subject solicitation will be issued (i.e. made available) in electronic media and posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website (formerly known as Electronic Posting System (EPS)).  Once posted, the solicitation may be download or printed from the following Internet address: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/ (the same site is also accessible/co-located at http://www.eps.gov). The FRA does not intend to make the solicitation available in hard copy.  (Note: The anticipated solicitation release date cited above is a target date and is provided for information purposes only. The actual date of posting of the solicitation at FedBizOpps may be before, on, or after that date).  As of the release/posting of this notice, it is anticipated that the closing date for receipt of offers for the subject solicitation will be on or about January 11, 2007 (Note: The anticipated solicitation closing date cited above is a target date and is provided for information purposes only. The solicitation and the solicitation alone, shall establish and specify the closing or due date for receipt of offers). FRA will accept, review and evaluate proposals that provide services for 1) the Screening and Confirmatory Drug and Alcohol Tests in Urine & Blood; 2) the Post-Accident Toxicological Testing System; and 3) the Manufacture, Warehousing and Shipment of FRA Post-Accident Toxicology Boxes.  This is an unrestricted, competitive procurement.  All eligible, responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the Agency.

17. The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIRSYSCOM) PMA-275 intends to award a Delivery Order on a Sole-Source basis under BOA N00019-05-G-0008 to Raytheon Technical Services Corporation (RTSC) to provide services and products in the area of V-22 maintenance data ground stations.  This effort requires intricate knowledge of the diagnostic ground station used by the V-22 platform which is poised for two key program milestones - Initial Operational Capability (IOC) for MV-22 anticipated in June 2007 and Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E) for CV-22 anticipated in October of 2007.  RTSC is the only known source independent of the V-22 prime contractor that has the prerequisite knowledge and expertise required to execute the following efforts without significantly impacting schedule and cost constraints to the program.

V-22 Aircraft Maintenance Event Ground Station (AMEGS).

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center - Panama City, 110 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, Florida intends to solicit Wing Inflatables, Inc., 1132 Somoa Blvd., Arcata, CA 95521, on a sole-source basis for sponson parts for the 11 Meter Naval Special Warfare Rigid Inflatable Boat  (11M NSW RIB).  The 11M NSW RIB is a high-speed combatant craft used by the Special Boat Teams to support the Maritime Special Operations mission. This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition because the government does not own the technical data package or specifications for the sponsons and the sponsons manufactured by Wings Inflatable are the only sponsons that have been tested, certified, and approved by the US Navy for use on the RIBs.  Firms desiring to have their product certified for future requirements must contact Mark Brinkerhoff at Mark.Brinkerhoff@navsoc.navy.mil, phone 619-437-0840.  The certification process would take between 12 and 18 months and would require the contract!  or to provide approximately 5 complete sets of sponsons, at no charge to the Government, for testing.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) has a requirement to procure the services of Ms. Sharon Bradley, Kensington, MD 20895.  Ms. Bradley would be responsible for several NICHD functions that cannot be reassigned to the already overburdened RP AB Biologists. These include the proofing of coding for the CHIRP database, and the referral and coding for the ENG, DBGT and OPP Branches. Moreover one of the annual official duties for the branch has been the reporting of approximately 240 disease categories to Congress, or the Moyer Report. The Office of the Director has mandated that all budget numbers for the 240 diseases/conditions submitted to Congress be complete by December 15, 2007 and 2008. All of the scientific coding for NICHD funded grants, contract, and intramural projects must be coded by approximately the first of November in order that Congress will have the end of the fiscal year budgetary information for the Institute. RP AB does not have the adequate FTE staff to comply with this short turn around time for the projects. In addition, despite the advance of the Knowledge Management of Disease Coding (KMDC) System, it is still in the developmental and experimental stages, and the Institute will be responsible for not only providing material and lists of grants for KMDC, but also will need to keep its own system and coding ongoing, To compensate, the Branch will rely on the expertise of Ms. Bradley to help with the preliminary coding, scientific programmatic assignments, initial coding of grants and programmatic analysis. The Referral and Program Analysis Branch (RPAB) serves as the NICHD's office for scientific programmatic assignment of scientific research grants, contracts and intramural projects; for developing and maintaining the official scientific, administrative and fiscal database;  and for analyzing and reporting on the Institute's scientific/administrative research programs. The Branch and its scientific staff are responsible for the scientific coding and updating of the Child Health Information Retrieval (CHIRP) system. The Branch uses this and other data bases to support NICHD's decision making and to respond to ad hoc inquires from governmental officials, congress and the public, concerning the Institute's scientific portfolio. Given the importance of this work, and the increasing number of requests, it is critical that the Branch maintain the accuracy, quality and quantity of its work. Several years ago, RP AB had to contend with the retirement of two very senior staff members.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, however, all responses received, before the closing date, of this announcement will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition is based upon responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  It is anticipated that the Request for Quotation (RFQ) NIH-NIDDK-07-057 will be available fifteen (15) days after the release of the RFQ.  Receipt of quotations will be due ten (10) days after the release of the RFQ.  The anticipated award date is December 1, 2006.  Request for copies of the RFQ must be in writing to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, 6707 Democracy Boulevard, Two Democracy Plaza, Room 774B, Bethesda, MD 20817 Attention: V. Lynn Griffin.  FAX quotations must contain offerors name, address, telephone number and fax number.  FAX quotations will be accepted if dated and signed by an authorized company representative.  FAX NUMBER 301-480-8501. All requests for quotation must include a valid email address.

<SUBJECT>R -- FOSTERING SCIENTIFIC EVALUATION OF DONOR-FUNDED HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Fogarty International Center (FIC) has a requirement to procure the services of Temina Madon, Washington, DC to establish framework for exploring role of FIC in promoting and fostering scientific evaluation of Donor-Funded Health Care Programs in developing countries.  High quality, rigorous scientific evaluations are rarely included in the planning and implementation stages of development programs for health. As a result, the international development community has missed numerous opportunities for "learning while doing." More importantly, thousands of lives have been lost as a result of using scarce development funds to support ineffective programming.  A recent report by the Center for Global Development's Evaluation Gap Working Group (When Will We Ever Learn?: Improving Lives through Impact Evaluation, CGD, May 2006) has catalyzed conversations between development experts and health sciences researchers, resulting in a consensus that we must seize opportunities for applied research created by recent growth in funding for international health.  This project will establish a framework for exploring the role of the Fogarty International Center in promoting and fostering scientific evaluation of donor-funded health care programs in developing countries. The project coordinator will be responsible for analyzing existing efforts to support scientific evaluation and operations research in developing countries. As part of this process, key stakeholders will be identified, including foreign assistance providers, development program implementers, academic researchers, and multi-lateral organizations. A second phase of the project will involve the coordination and implementation of a stakeholder meeting, to discuss the Center's potential contributions to such activities. The stakeholder meeting will include members of other Federal agencies, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator, as well as non-governmental organizations like the Institute of Medicine and the Center for Global Development. Academic researchers and multi-lateral institutions, such as the World Bank and the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, will also be represented. The purpose of the meeting will be to identify gaps in existing scientific evaluation activities that might benefit from the Center's particular expertise in facilitating international research collaborations and building scientific capacity abroad.  The meeting will result in the development of a strategic plan for the Center's involvement in scientific research on the implementation and impacts of development programs for health. Meeting participants will also develop recommendations for the mechanics of such involvement.   This position also requires close collaboration with the Director of the Division of Advanced Studies and Policy Analysis (DASPA).  While working with the Committee, Ms. Madon has established relationships with representatives of numerous global health and health sciences organizations, including the World Health Organization, the Global Fund, the Global Health Council, the Gates Foundation, and the Center for Global Development. Ms. Madon also has relationships with staff at several Federal agencies, including the CDC, USAID, and the State Department. These contacts will prove invaluable in the convening of stakeholders involved in this project.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, however, all responses received, before the closing date, of this announcement will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition is based upon responses to this notice and is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<SOLNBR>PR-HQ-06-14395
<RESPDATE>053006
<CONTACT>JOHN J. NANARTOWICZ, Placement Contracting Officer, Phone: 202-564-4756, E-Mail: nanartowicz.john@epa.gov
<DESC>THIS REQUIREMENT WILL BE PROCURED AS A SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE COMPETITIVE ACTION.  THE APPLICABLE NAICS CODE IS 541710 WITH A SIZE STANDARD OF 500 EMPLOYEES!! BACKGROUND: The Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Research and Development established the National Center for Computational Toxicology (NCCT)  in 2005 to research the utility of computational chemistry, high-throughput screening (HTS) and various toxicogenomic technologies for Agency use in chemical prioritization, quantitative risk assessment and biological modeling. As part of this, the NCCT is developing computational tools for interpreting data from these technologies to classify chemicals, predict toxicity, and prioritize limited testing resources towards chemicals and endpoints that present the greatest risk to human health and the environment. Thus a chemical prioritization research program, entitled ToxCast, is being initiated with the purpose of developing the ability to predict, or forecast toxicity.  The proof-of-concept phase of ToxCast will focus upon chemicals with a rich toxicological database (e.g., registered pesticide actives), in order to provide an interpretive context. Following this proof-of-concept, the ToxCast program will move on to other environmental chemicals domains relevant to EPA. The ToxCast program will evaluate chemical properties and effects across a broad spectrum of information domains: physical-chemical properties, predicted biological activities based on existing structure-activity models, biochemical properties based on HTS assays, cell based phenotypic assays, and genomic and metabolomic analyses of cells.  SCOPE: Much of the data in these various domains will be generated through a series of seven (7) integrated Performance Work Statements (PWS). The contracts that will be awarded from these PWS will be essential components of the ToxCast program over the next five years, providing data populating the various domains that can be interpretively linked to known or predicted toxicological properties of environmental chemicals. This Request for Proposals (RFP) (# PR-HQ-06-14395) will be soliciting proposals for five (5) of the seven (7) PWS that make up the laboratory services requirement of the ToxCast Program.  Potential offerors and interested parties should visit the EPA website to review all documents that relate to the program and these procurements.  The EPA website is  at: http://www.epa.gov/oamhpod1/adm_placement/prhq0614395/prhq0614395.htm  The five (5) performance work statements under this RFP are SET-ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESS competition.   It should be noted that hard copies of the RFP will not be mailed out, but will be available for down-loading from the EPA website along with all associated and supporting documents. Email the Contracting Officer at "nanartowicz.john@epa.gov" to express your interest in this solicitation package.  Please include in your e-mail your firms complete name and address for Source List purposes.  Due to the anticipated large volume of interest, we will be unable to return phone calls or respond to e-mail inquiries for these procurements.  You may be able to retrieve a copy of the RFP package on or about June 1, 2006.

<SOLNBR>RFQ-OH-07-00015
<RESPDATE>112206
<ARCHDATE>12222006
<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Scott Fogle, Purchasing Agent, Phone (513) 487-2049
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   This is a combined synopsis/request for quote (RFQ) for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The identifying RFQ number is RFQ-OH-07-00015.  The RFQ and incorporated provisions/clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-13.  A firm fixed price purchase order is anticipated to result from the award of this RFQ.  The NAICS code is 541710.   STATEMENT OF WORK I.   Project Identification:  Report on Emission from Green Power  Sources (Wind,                                                               Landfill Gas (LFG) and Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) II. Period of Performance:   Duration of 12 months from award date. III. Type of Purchase Order:  Firm Fixed Price  IV. Estimated Labor Hours:  680 hours Background  and Objectives Although "green power" is an imprecise term, it generally includes renewable (i.e., wind, solar, and biomass) and other clean energy technologies (e.g., municipal solid waste and landfill gas) that generate electricity. Most green power generated in the U.S. is sold in the form of  green tags. Electricity consumers can opt to pay a premium for green tags, which give them exclusive ownership of the positive environmental attributes of the purchased electricity . As a result, many private and commercial customers buy green tags to reduce the greenhouse gas and air pollutant  emissions associated with their electricity use. The estimation of net consumer emissions is complicated by the purchase of green tags because it requires knowledge of which conventional generators are being offset by the purchased green power. There is no simple way to precisely determine which  conventional generators are displaced by the purchased green energy. Accurate estimates require detailed knowledge of electric power system operation, particularly the inter- and intra-hour dispatch schedules of available generators by the North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) sub  region, as well as the emissions rates of each plant.  The EPA has developed a methodology that estimates the net emissions including green power purchases using average annual emission rates by NERC sub region, obtained from eGRID. The analysis recognizes that using such aggregate estimates is  likely to produce misleading single-value estimates of emissions offsets. As a result, three offset scenarios were defined to quantify the uncertainty associated with estimating emissions offsets when detailed system dispatch data are unavailable. Each scenario assumes that purchased renewables  displace the electricity from different types of power plants: fossil capacity (environmental scenario), gas turbines with high marginal cost (economic scenario), and all conventional units (proportional scenario). These three offset scenarios form upper and lower bounds as well as a median  estimate that characterizes the uncertainty associated with system dispatch. The next step in the analysis and the subject of this requirement is to accurately report on emissions from green power sources (i.e., wind, landfill gas, and municipal solid waste) by identifying the conventional units  that are likely to be displaced. The output of this project can serve as the basis for developing decision-making strategies that maximize the benefit of green power purchases.  V. Scope of Work The Contractor shall conduct a national assessment of emissions offsets from wind, landfill gas, and  municipal solid waste by NERC sub region. Emissions of primary interest are SO2, NOX, Hg, and CO2. Task 1: Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) The Contractor shall provide a Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) as required by Attachment #1. No additional work shall be initiated until the QAPP  has been provided, reviewed, and approved by the EPA Project Officer (PO). Task 2: Collect operating data on green power technologies  A)	The Contractor shall collect (from less than 10 organizations) hourly wind power time series specific to each NERC sub region for use in Task 5. Recorded wind  power time series are preferable, but simulated time series are acceptable. The hourly wind power data shall span the latest year (as of October 2006) for which Task 2 and 3 data are available. B)	The Contractor shall collect (from less than 10 organizations) dispatch data on LFG and MSW  generation. Because LFG and MSW generation are quasi-dispatchable, time series data for these technologies are not required. Instead, the Contractor shall assume simple dispatch schedules for LFG and MSW based on the operational characteristics of existing plants. The Contractor shall also  determine whether there are significant regional variations in the operating characteristics of LFG and MSW. If so, the Contractor shall use dispatch schedules specific to each NERC sub region. If not, the Contractor shall apply the same LFG and MSW dispatch schedules to all NERC sub regions.  Although LFG and MSW directly produce emissions during operation, work to characterize these emissions is underway in a separate analysis and need not be addressed for this requirement. Task 3: Collect operating data on conventional power plants The Contractor shall collect (from less than 10  organizations) plant-specific, hourly generation and emissions data grouped by NERC sub region. Hourly heat input and emissions rates for existing power plants are available from the U.S. EPA's Clean Air Markets Division (CAMD).  The hourly data shall cover an entire year, and correspond to the  same year as the wind data gathered in Task 2. Task 4: Develop methodology to identify conventional units displaced by green power  The Contractor shall develop a methodology to identify the conventional units that will be displaced by generation from green power sources. The methodology must take  into account the different operating characteristics of wind, LFG, and MSW. Because wind is not dispatchable, it must be offset by load-following units capable of ramping output to compensate wind. On the other hand, landfill gas and municipal solid waste plants produce power at relatively constant  levels, which may affect system dispatch differently than wind power. Without marginal prices for each unit by hour and control area (cost data are proprietary), it is not possible to fully recreate the precise order of system dispatch. However, statistical methods can be used to categorize units  by their mode of operation (i.e., baseload, spinning reserve, and standby). Depending on the production characteristics of the green power technology, units from particular operating categories will be displaced. Using the data gathered in Tasks 2 and 3, green and conventional power production  shall then be compared on an hourly basis to determine which conventional plants (and therefore emissions) is displaced hour-to-hour. For a detailed methodological example, see Berlinski and Connors (2006) . Because the methodology relies on statistical methods, the Contractor shall address the  uncertainty inherent in using statistical methods to identify the plants being displaced by green power. In addition, the Contractor shall characterize the temporal variability in emissions offsets using standard statistical methods. Task 5: Estimate emissions offsets  The Contractor shall utilize  the output from Tasks 2 through 4 to estimate the hourly emissions offsets by NERC sub region for wind, LFG, and MSW. The Contractor shall perform this analysis for the latest year in which all required data are available, as of October 2006. The Contractor shall include the following in the  analysis and report: "	A detailed description of the methodology developed to calculate emissions offsets. "	Average hourly emissions rates from conventional plants displaced by green power, in units of g/kWh, by NERC sub region. o	An area plot showing each hourly value (24?365) for the entire  year. o	A scatter plot that shows the average values by time-of-day and season.  "	Average hourly wind power production, relative to 1 MW of capacity, by NERC sub region. o	An area plot showing each hourly value (24?365) for the entire year. o	A scatter plot that shows the average production values  by time-of-day and season.  "	Average hourly emissions offsets, in units of g/kWh, by green power source and NERC sub region. o	An area plot showing each hourly value (24?365) for the entire year. o	A scatter plot that shows the average offset values by time-of-day and season.  Optional Task Task  6 (a modification will be processed to exercise this task, as needed ): The Contractor shall perform Tasks 2 through 5 for both the latest year available (as of October 2006) and an earlier year for comparative purposes. The Contractor shall select an earlier year for comparative analysis prior to  the realignment of NERC sub regions (according to recently formed ISOs) and the steep ramp in natural gas prices that began a couple of years ago. VI. Reporting Requirements The Contractor shall provide written products to the PO as specified in the above tasks.  All products must be of high  quality, written in a clear concise style, with a logical organization and presentation.  Products not adhering to these standards, or substantially lacking scientific quality, will not be accepted.  The Contractor shall use current EPA guidelines for performance of work, unless otherwise  specified.  The Contractor shall provide all written materials and responses in both hard copy and electronic format, (ie: Microsoft Word and CD-ROM). VII. Deliverable Schedule 1. In accordance with Task 1, the QAPP shall be provided within 3 weeks after award or an order. 2. 120 days after the  QAPP is approved, the Contractor shall deliver an interim report, in accordance with Tasks 2 through 5 that outlines the data used in the analysis, describes the proposed methodology (including treatment of uncertainty), and provides sample results. The PO shall review the interim report and  provide feedback in NLT 30 days. 3. 120 days after receiving feedback on the interim report from the PO, the Contractor shall deliver a draft final report.  The PO shall review the draft final report and provide feedback in NLT 30 days. 4. 60 days after receiving feedback on the draft final report  from the PO, the Contractor shall deliver a final report. ***Note:  Due to the length of the SOW, Technical Evaluation Criteria, and Attachments 1, the EPA could not post the entire information to the Fed Biz Ops website.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The starters will be replaced with new units with an available parts source. Slide Gate Chamber Level:  In order to monitor True gate position at all times, the Selsyn motor position indication system will be replaced with more accurate position indicating resolvers.  Redundant resolvers and FULL OPEN, HALF OPEN, and FULL CL OSED limit switches will be added to each gate to verify position .  The existing gate position staff gages will be retained and two PTZ cameras will be added to permit remote assessment of the actual position of each gate.  Redundant high water level floats will be added to the sump pump pit to alert the operator of wat er in the Slide Gate Chamber.  Backup manual operation of the control system will be maintained on this level.  The manual controls in the chamber will be replaced and a hydraulic power unit pump ON/OFF pushbutton and EMERGENCY STOP pushbutton will be added to allow the operator to start system from the Slide Gate Chamber Level. Outlet Works:  A separate PTZ camera, illumination fixtures, and network connection will be installed to assess the discharge channel. Connect and interface the control system to the existing USGS gauging system to monitor the outflow from the gates.

Space will not be considered where apartment space or other living quarters are located within the building.  The Government requires a fully serviced lease including a total of fifty-six (56) on-site parking spaces.  The agency shall have access to their space 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  Normal hours of operation for the agency are Monday through Friday 6:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and federal holidays).

17.  The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIRSYSCOM) PMA-275 intends to award a Delivery Order on a Sole-Source basis under BOA N00019-05-G-0008 to Raytheon Technical Services Corporation (RTSC) to provide services and products in the areas of V-22 Avionics Systems Engineering and V-22 Software Support Activity (SSA).  This effort requires intricate knowledge of avionics systems and software used by the V-22 platform, which is poised for two key program milestones - Initial Operational Capability (IOC) for MV-22 anticipated in June 2007 and Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E) for CV-22 anticipated in October of 2007.  RTSC is the only known source independent of the V-22 prime contractor that has the prerequisite knowledge and expertise required to execute the following efforts without significantly impacting schedule and cost constraints of the program:

(A) V-22 Development Avionics Systems Engineering.  RTSC will continue to provide avionics developmental engineering, Configuration Management (CM), Data Management (DM), and logistics engineering for Full Authority Digital Engine Controller (FADEC), engine and aircraft health monitoring systems (Vibration, Structural Life, and Engine Diagnostics (VSLED)), Drive System Interface Unit (DSIU), Ice Protection System (IPS), Wing Fire Protection Controller (WFPC), Fuel Management System (FMS), Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR), Digital Map System (DMS), Auxiliary Power Unit (APU), Directed Infrared Countermeasures (DIRCM), Suite of Integrated Radio Frequency Countermeasures (SIRFC), and a Multi-Mode Radar (MMR) for low altitude "nap of the earth" flying. Engineers are shared between V-22 Development Avionics Systems Engineering and the Software Support Activity (SSA) so that the same engineer working on the latest V-22 avionics development is also working to solve V-22 fleet issues and recommending fleet enhancements.  RTSC engineers also provide extensive inputs into avionics development, integration, and production by working on V-22 avionics Integrated Product Teams (IPTs) with the prime contractor (Bell-Boeing), avionics suppliers, and the Government.  RTSC is the Governments designated representative to perform Formal Qualification Testing (FQT) of the V-22 Operational Flight Program (OFP), JVX Application System Software (JASS).

(B) V-22 Software Support Activity (SSA) and Software Development. RTSC will continue to provide avionics systems and software engineering to resolve post-production issues and develop enhancements for autopilot (a.k.a. Flight Director), navigation, control of communication systems, aircraft & engine health monitoring, mission management and mission planning correlation, sensors & EW management, and reporting and management of various other subsystems.

The Navy intends to award a Sole-Source, Cost Plus Fixed Fee Delivery Order for this requirement.  The period of performance is to start 02 January 2007 through 31 December 2007.  The estimated issue date for this Order is 02 January 2007.  Services under current contract number N00421-02-D-3073 with Raytheon Technical Services Corporation expire 31 December 2006.  This synopsis is for information purposes only.*****

The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIRSYSCOM) PMA-275 intends to award a Delivery Order on a Sole-Source basis under BOA N00019-05-G-0008 to Raytheon Technical Services Corporation (RTSC) to provide services and products in the areas of V-22 Mission Planning System (VMPS), V-22 Desktop Test Environment (DTE), V-22 Interactive Situational Awareness System (VISAS), V-22 Laboratory Management and Update, and V-22 Avionics Simulation Software. This effort requires intricate knowledge of avionics systems, V-22 avionics simulation software, V-22 avionics laboratories, and related products used by the V-22 platform, which is poised for two key program milestones - Initial Operational Capability (IOC) for MV-22 anticipated in June 2007 and Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E) for CV-22 anticipated in October of 2007. RTSC is the only known source that has the prerequisite knowledge and expertise required to execute the following efforts without significantly impacting schedule and cost constraints of the program: 

(A) V-22 Mission Planning System (VMPS).  The VMPS is comprised of two Computer Software Configuration Items (CSCIs).  These items have been procured from RTSC under a multi-year ongoing phased developmental effort.  The VMPS CSCIs are the Joint Mission Planning Software (JMPS), which is the software framework that is used as a basis for VMPS, and the V-22 Unique Planning Component (UPC) that implements V-22 unique mission planning functionality.

(B) V-22 Interactive Situational Awareness System (VISAS) Development and Production.  The VISAS was designed and developed by RTSC.  It is a system that will connect to the Troop Commander Panel provided in the V-22 passenger cabin, and will provide situational awareness data to V-22 passengers.  The VISAS uses simulation software products developed by RTSC.  This is an ongoing project that has been in development for six years, and will continue to be updated during the MV-22 Block C and CV-22 Block 20 developments. The initial version of
VISAS is required for CV-22 IOT&E in October 2007.

(C) V-22 Laboratory Management and Upgrade, and Avionics Software Simulation Products. The main avionics facility that is used by all RTSC Indianapolis projects is the V-22 Avionics Integration Laboratory (VAIL).  RTSC will continue to expand the VAIL capabilities as new hardware is received to support the Software Support Activity (SSA).  Avionics Software Simulation Products include V-22 Dynamic Display System (VDDS), Simulation Control
(SIMCNTRL), JVX Simulation Support Software - Automated Test Tool (JSSS-ATT), Virtual Emulated Mission Data Loader (VEMDL) and Bus Controller Tool (BC-Tool).  Desktop Test Environment (DTE) software takes all of the Avionics Software Simulation products and migrates
them from a Unix-based workstation to a Personal Computer (PC) environment.  Additionally, DTE adds a simulation of the V-22 Operational Flight Program (OFP), JVX Application Support Software (JASS) so that software developers have a "virtual lab" available to help test and develop avionics
software.

The Navy intends to award a Sole-Source, Cost Plus Fixed Fee Delivery Order for this requirement.  The period of performance is to start 02 January 2007 through 31 December 2007.  The estimated issue date for this Order is 02 January 2007.  Services under current contract number N00421-02-D-3073 with Raytheon Technical Services Corporation expire 31 December 2006.

Original Announcement:
The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) is interested in identifying Small Business organizations with requisite qualifications to assist with the conduct of two large scale nationally-representative school-based surveys on adolescent health behavior.  The Prevention Research Branch (PRB), an intramural research group of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), conducts research on child and adolescent health behavior.  One of the PRB areas of emphasis is assessment of the prevalence and determinants of health behavior among adolescents.  Toward this end, the PRB plans to conduct two surveys beginning in the 2009-2010 school year: a cross-sectional national probability survey of U.S. 6th-10th graders that is also consistent with the requirements of the international Health Behavior in School-aged Children (HBSC) survey; and a 4-year longitudinal survey of independent national probability samples of U.S. 11-year-old and 15-year-old students.

The HBSC survey is conducted among national or regional samples of students at ages 11, 13, and 15 in about 40 countries.  The cross-sectional international HBSC survey requires at least 1536 youth in each age group and a total of 5000 students.  The goal of the cross-sectional HBSC survey is to obtain data about adolescent health behavior and to make this information available so as to enable the improvement of health services and programs for youth. The goals of the cross-sectional U.S. survey are to provide health behavior information about adolescents nationally (U.S.-specific protocol) and to enable international comparisons by incorporating the mandatory HBSC protocol.

The U.S. longitudinal survey requires a probability sample that will permit estimates of population percentages with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points at the 95% confidence level for each age. The goals of the U.S. longitudinal survey include: to identify the trajectory of adolescent health behaviors from pre-adolescence through the post high school year; to examine the predictors of the onset of key adolescent risk behaviors during this period; to identify family, school, and social/environmental factors that promote or sustain positive health behaviors; and to identify transition points in health risk behaviors and changes in family, school, and social/environmental precursors to these transitions.

Surveys consistent with the cross-sectional HBSC were conducted in the U.S. in 1997-1998, 2001-2002, and 2005-2006. In international comparisons, previous HBSC surveys showed that U.S. 15-year-old youth are less likely to smoke than students in most other countries surveyed, even though 13-year-old US students experiment with tobacco in comparable proportions to youth in other countries.  U.S. youth are more likely to be overweight than students in the other HBSC countries.  U.S. eating habits were also shown to be less healthy with a comparatively high proportion of youth consuming high fat foods and soft drinks with sugar.  Analyses of the U.S. national data set have addressed bullying, unintentional injury, behaviors related to obesity, and utilization of health care.  
            
The 2009-2010 U.S. surveys will address health-related factors according to rigorous protocols to be developed by the HBSC by June of 2009, and should also include additional factors and dimensions that are relevant to the U.S. experience.  To be deemed capable, a small business must demonstrate their ability to: 1)  develop a school-based, national probability sampling plan that would provide a nationally-representative sample, including appropriate over-sampling of racial minority students; 2) employ contacts at state and local departments of education and school districts to gain access to schools for surveys;  3)  identify and recruit in a period of 4 months two national samples of middle and high schools, one involving > 15000 students and > 400 schools (representing a national probability sample from which the total of 5000 11.5, 13.5, and 15.5 year-old  students for the HBSC sub-sample will be drawn) with an 80% rate of participation, and a second national sample of > 6000 11- and 15-year-old students meeting the same criteria as the cross-sectional sample;  4) identify, establish, and maintain a national network of data collectors; 5) recruit, train, and manage data collectors working in locations dispersed across the country; 6) conduct a national school-based survey involving >15000 students and >400 schools; 7) conduct a 4-year longitudinal assessment of >6000 11- and 15-year-old students that may include both in-school and at-home assessments; 7) employ SUDAN or similar statistical programs for basic management of weighted cross-sectional samples; 8) manage large data sets with students nested within schools; 9) prepare data summaries and preliminary analyses; and 10) prepare public use data sets. 

AT THIS TIME THE NICHD IS ONLY REQUESTING CAPABILITY STATEMENTS FROM SMALL BUSINESSES.    THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.   The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 541710.  Therefore, the small business size standard for this announcement is 500 employees or less.  See http://www.sba.gov/size/ for information on what is a small business and part 121.106 of the SBA's Small Business Size Regulations on how the SBA calculates the number of employees. 

Small Businesses that meet the applicable size standard and believe that they have the capabilities described above are encouraged to submit a written Capability Statement to attention of Elizabeth Osinski at the address provided by 3:00 PM Local Time on Thursday, November 16, 2006. Overnight deliveries should be mailed to the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Contracts Management Branch, 6100 Executive Boulevard, MSC 7510, Bethesda, Maryland 20852. See Numbered Note 25. No collect calls or facsimiles will be accepted.  The Capability Statement should be limited to no more than 15 pages and it should address each of the competencies stated above.  If responses indicate a reasonable expectation of obtaining competitive offers from two or more responsible and capable small business concerns the anticipated subsequent Request for Proposals will be set-aside for small businesses only.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation to amend Solicitation Number SAQMPD07Q0001 posted 10/23/2006.  The awarded contract shall provide the Department of State's Office of Medical Services (MED) with clincial laboratory testing services.  MED performs physical exams to determine availability of Foreign Service Officers and their families to assignments overseas to approximately 200 embassies and consulates.  As such, MED performs 6500 to 7000 physical examinations per year that require laboratory tests and results.  Although most testing is done in house, some tests cannot be performed within MED and must be sent out for testing.  MED also receives samples from overseas activities for testing.

Further, our overseas posts will be required to send some time sensitive tests directly to the testing laboratory to maintain the viability of the sample. The awarded contract will include a base year and one option year.

Approximately 5 miles east of Angels Camp, take Parrotts Ferry Road south.  About 1-1/4 miles south of the Parrotts Ferry Road/State Route 4 junction, Camp Nine Road branches off to the east.  The bridge is located about 7-8 miles east of the Parrotts Ferry turnoff.  The Camp Nine Road is steep, narrow and winding.  Access by large vehicles may be limited.  Access to the north end of the bridge has been eliminated by reconstruction or realignment of the Camp Nine Road.  Access to the south end of the bridge can be obtained by crossing the New Camp Nine Bridge, located about two miles downstream of the Old Camp Nine Bridge.  After crossing over the new bridge, turn left and travel in a northeasterly direction to the site of the old bridge.  BACKGROUND--Old Camp Nine Bridge is a steel bridge consisting of three spans.  On the center span, the steel stringers are supported by steel floor beams which in turn are supported by Warren trusses.  The stringers on each of the two approaches to the center span are supported by two steel bents.  The timber deck of the bridge, though severely deteriorated, is still present on the north span and central span.  Timber guardrails are still intact on the north approach span.  The timber guardrails and timber decking have been stripped from the southern span of the bridge.  The construction date of the bridge is unknown and no drawings of the structure are known to exist.  It has been speculated that the bridge was originally built to serve the town of Camp Nine which once stood where PG&E's Stanislaus Powerhouse is now located.  The bridge may have been built to provide access to the old Stanislaus Powerhouse. During the construction of New Melones Dam, the New Camp Nine Bridge, a modern concrete and steel bridge with increased load-carrying capacity, was built approximately 2 miles downstream from Old Camp Nine Bridge.  With the introduction of this new bridge, Old Camp Nine Bridge was no longer required to provide access across the upper Stanislaus River.  Following construction of the new bridge, the approach road at the north end of Old Camp Nine Bridge was apparently realigned, cutting the bridge off from traffic at that end.  The bridge has been inundated from time to time due to the fact that it lies below the high lake surface elevation of 1088.00 feet above mean sea level.  The pavement for the north approach road to the bridge consists of an 18-inch thick concrete slab, half of which is now missing.  The upstream half of the slab is missing and the downstream side of the roadway is severely undercut.  This undercutting ranges between 1'-6" and 3'-10" depending, on location.  Because of the undercutting, the remaining concrete slab has sagged slightly under its own weight.  The concrete slab that remains is in good condition.  Photographic evidence implies that the steel components of the bridge were coated with a red- lead primer paint, covered by an aluminum overcoat.  THE REQUIREMENT--The Contractor is required to remove the bridge, as described below.  Due to fluctuating lake surface levels, the onsite demolition work will have to be performed during the months of August and September, 2007.  Prior to commencing onsite work, the Contractor shall obtain Government approval of the Contractor's proposed method of preventing debris from entering the waterway.  The Government will obtain all environmental permits required to perform the work, based on the method of removal proposed by the Contractor and accepted by the Government.  The Contractor is required to comply with all conditions of the permits in force during the contract work.  The Contractor shall:  1.  Remove the timber deck (two spans). 2.  Remove all steel (stringers, trusses, bracing, bents, and all embedded anchor rods projecting above the rock line). 3.  Remove the two concrete piers (one located at each end of the center span) down to the rock line.  4.  Remove six (6) short concrete walls, three (3) per side.  Four of the six are foundations for steel bents that provided intermediate support for the bridge stringers on the outer spans.  5.  Preserve abutment, wing walls, and pavement slab on the north side of the river.  6.  Remove guardrail from roadway slab on north side of river.  7.  Remove south abutment and wing walls.  8.  Preserve rubble walls adjacent to and in the vicinity of the abutment wing walls on both sides of river.  9.  Remove miscellaneous debris (timbers, broken concrete, scrap steel).  10. Remove fence barriers that have been placed at each end of the bridge to close off access. All removed materials shall become the property of the Contractor and disposed of offsite in an approved manner.  RESTRICTIONS--It is imperative that the demolition work be performed without damaging the rubble walls adjacent to the north abutment and the rubble walls in the vicinity of the south abutment.  Also, the roadway on the south end of the bridge must be preserved.  These rubble walls are part of the historic Camp Nine Road and must be protected under federal cultural resource protection laws. Damage to the walls or to the roadway resulting from the Contractor's operation will be required to be repaired by the Contractor at the expense of the Contractor.  The Contractor shall comply with all federal, state and local laws and regulations, including but not limited to: National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), Endangered Species Act (ESA), Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, National Historic Preservation Act, Archeological Resources Protection Act, 49 CFR for Hazardous Materials, 40 CFR for Solid Wastes, OSHA for Safety, Department of Transportation for transportation issues, Federal Aviation Administration for air transport etc.  Contractor shall comply with Reclamation Safety and Health Standards.  Some species that may be impacted by the work are:  kokanee salmon, bald eagles, ospreys, and valley elderberry longhorn beetles.

<CONTACT>JOHN J. NANARTOWICZ, Placement Contracting Officer, Phone: 202-564-4756, E-Mail: nanartowicz.john@epa.gov
<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS FOR INFORMATION ONLY FROM ALL TYPES OF SMALL BUSINESSES (SB, SDB, SDVOSB, Woman-Owned SB, etc.).  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541710.  RESPONSES ARE DUE, Close of Business, May 8, 2006. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS INFORMATION REQUEST.   NO REIMBURSEMENT WILL BE MADE FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO THIS REQUEST, OR ANY SUBSEQUENT FOLLOW-UP REQUESTS.   NO TELEPHONE CALLS REQUESTING A SOLICITATION WILL BE ACCEPTED OR ACKNOWLEDGED.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.   RESPONSES SHALL NOT EXCEED 20 PAGES AND STANDARD COMPANY BROCHURES ARE NOT DESIRED. INFORMATION SHALL FOCUS ON THE CAPABILITY TO PROVIDE LABORATORY SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL SERVICES AS DEFINED BELOW.   The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is performing a market survey to identify small businesses that have technical capabilities that can support the National Center for Computational Toxicology (NCCT) in the Office of Research and Development (ORD).  Specifically, the EPA is conducting a market survey to determine the potential for small businesses to perform the services defined in this synopsis and in the draft Statements of Work, which have been posted at the following EPA website: http://www.epa.gov/oamhpod1/adm_placement/prhq0614395/prhq0614395.htm.   THIS SYNOPSIS represents the research laboratory services requirement previously published under SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS PR-NC-06-10151, entitled "HIGH-THROUGHPUT SCREENING (HTS) AND TOXICOGENOMIC SERVICES."  BACKGROUND: EPA/ORD established the NCCT in 2005 to research the utility of computational chemistry, high-throughput screening (HTS) and various toxicogenomic technologies for Agency use in chemical prioritization, quantitative risk assessment and biological modeling.  As part of this, the NCCT is developing computational tools for interpreting data from these technologies to classify chemicals, predict toxicity, and prioritize limited testing resources towards chemicals and endpoints that present the greatest risk to human health and the environment.  Thus a chemical prioritization research program, entitled ToxCast, is being initiated with the purpose of developing the ability to predict, or forecast toxicity.  The proof-of-concept phase of ToxCast will focus upon chemicals with a rich toxicological database (e.g., registered pesticide actives), in order to provide an interpretive context.   Following this proof-of-concept, the ToxCast program will move on to other environmental chemicals domains relevant to EPA.  The ToxCast program will evaluate chemical properties and effects across a broad spectrum of information domains: physical-chemical properties, predicted biological activities based on existing structure-activity models, biochemical properties based on HTS assays, cell based phenotypic assays, and genomic and metabolomic analyses of cells.   SCOPE: Much of the data in these various domains will be generated through a series of eight integrated Performance Work Statements (PWS).  The contracts awarded relative to these PWS will be essential components of the ToxCast program over the next five years, providing data populating the various domains that can be interpretively linked to known or predicted toxicological properties of environmental chemicals.  Thus the structured strategy developed within ToxCast to classify chemicals, identify or predict potential toxicities and pathways, and to prioritize chemicals for subsequent testing will be dependent on the data and resources available through these contracts.   Small businesses with the capability of providing these services are invited to submit, in writing, sufficient information within the page limitation (20 pages) which demonstrates their ability to perform this type of work. Responses, including the vendor?s business status (e.g.:  small, small disadvantaged, minority-owned, 8(a), SDVOSB, etc.) should be sent electronically to the Contracting Officer, John J. Nanartowicz III, at the following e-mail address? nanartowicz.john@epa.gov.   If vendors so desire, hardcopy information supplementing the electronic submission can be sent to the following address: U.S. EPA; ATTN.: Sue Davis (Mail Drop D-305-01), Research Triangle Park, N.C., 27711.  COURIER/OVERNIGHT CARRIER ADDRESS: U.S. EPA; ATTN.: Sue Davis (Mail Drop D-305-01); 4930 Old Page Road Durham, NC   27703.  Capability statements shall be submitted no later than May 8, 2006.

All replacement parts shall be new, OEM approved parts. The Unites States Coast Guard will not provide Government Furnished Material for this requirement.  Offerors must possess a current FAA certification or an OEM certification to perform overhaul and service on the items listed above and must provide proof of these certifications with the proposal; or other certifications; (such as DOD Certification), to be submitted to the Contracting Officer for review and approval on a case by case basis.

Nonreworkable items replaced during overhaul shall be disposed of as scrap, which means to render those items unusable for their intended purpose.  Should any of the reparables be determined "Beyond Economical Repair", the contractor shall immediately notify the Contracting Officer and await disposition instructions.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date ( if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011

<DESC>This Broad Agency Announcement is for Basic and Applied Research in accordance with FAR 35.016.  This BAA is listed at http://www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations/ and also the Joint Precision and Approach Landing System (JPALS) website at https://home.navair.navy.mil/pma213/jpals_industry/login.asp.  Responses to this BAA should be submitted in accordance with the guidelines set forth herein and will be accepted at the Contracting Office for a period of one (1) month from the date of this announcement. No formal solicitation will be issued; this BAA is the solicitation.

1.0	INTRODUCTION

The Government JPALS Team is releasing this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as an unclassified solicitation to seek proposals for research support in developing concept and architectural solutions for precision approach and landing system technologies.

2.0	 BACKGROUND  

The Government JPALS Team is conducting research to develop, acquire, integrate, test, and field a GPS-based aircraft precision approach and landing capability by 2014.  The JPALS Program is preparing to enter System Development and Demonstration (SDD) for Increment 1 JPALS in early Calendar Year 2008.  Increment 1 SDD will provide ground systems and a prototype aircraft system to support a two-hundred (200) ft Decision Height (DH) and one-half (1/2) nautical mile (nm) visibility precision approach and relative navigation capabilities in support of Sea-based operations.  Increment 1 also includes growth requirements for ground and aircraft systems to support two hundred (200) ft DH and one-half (1/2) statute mile (sm) visibility in support of fixed-base and tactical landing operations.  

The purpose of the BAA is to achieve additional risk reduction efforts by gaining additional insight and feedback on JPALS capability requirements, potential solution concepts and architectures, and program cost drivers.  Additionally, the information obtained through this BAA may be used to investigate growth paths for fixed land-based and mobile land-based JPALS variants, and future JPALS incremental capabilities as described in the Capabilities Description Document (CDD), and to provide industry support of the OSD Technology Readiness Assessment (TRA) process.  

3.0  AREAS OF INTEREST 
  
3.1  Sea-Based Trade Studies.  Explore the available trade space to determine a range of cost versus attainable operational effectiveness. Each trade study topic below includes areas to be addressed. Contractors are encouraged to include additional areas affecting cost and system effectiveness in their analysis. Results should be accompanied by supporting technical and business case analyses. When modeling and simulation is used to support analysis, a concise description of the model, how it works and how it was validated, should be included. Both development costs and Life Cycle Cost (LCC) should be considered in the analyses.

a. Sensors: Consider possible sensor or suite of sensors required to accomplish the functions, e.g., relative navigation, surveillance, and precision approach. In examining the sensor options and performance requirements, at a minimum, consider the operating environment, air-vehicle constraints, weather, and day/night operations. This analysis shall also assess the trades involved in optimizing current air-vehicle equipage with additional sensor requirements.
b. Aircraft Platforms: Consider current military aircraft avionics equipage and planned upgrades for suitability to meet JPALS subsystem level requirements.  In examining aircraft, consider numbers of Type/Model/Series (TMS) and levels of system commonality.  Additionally, consider achievable performance of new avionics systems installations as compared to use of existing avionics systems. 

3.2  Sea-Based System Requirements Reconciliation.  Conduct system requirements review and analysis to verify that your technical baseline meets the System Requirements Document (SRD) requirements and that the requirements are complete and consistent with the program CDD.

3.3  Sea-Based System Architecture.  Provide a description of a notional Modular Open System Approach (MOSA) architecture (Hardware/Software).  The approach shall provide a logical and cost effective progression to capabilities that are identified in the SRD and CDD, including future JPALS capability increments.  It shall leverage the commercial sector computing hardware technology investments for technology refresh and growth to future requirements beyond those identified in the SRD for Increment 1 and identified in the CDD as future increments. The description shall provide a modular, open system approach which has a sound basis for system development, sustainment and maintenance, capability enhancement, and future capability growth. The approach shall demonstrate a functionally partitioned construct that permits functional integration and test at the functional interface.  The architecture shall integrate non-proprietary, proprietary, military, and commercial applications whose selection within the system concept is substantiated by a business case analysis and shall establish key interfaces for hardware and software components that utilize widely-accepted open standards where possible.  Where open standards do not exist, establish non-proprietary logical and physical interface specifications to support the key interfaces.  Pertinent architecture attributes such as net centricity for support of Net Centric Operations and Warfare, interoperability with network enabled and disadvantaged users, multilevel security, data latency, C2, and safety of flight should be considered.  For each approach, thoroughly explore the architectural design to determine feasibility.  Contractors are encouraged to include additional areas affecting cost and architectural effectiveness in their analysis.  Results should be accompanied by a supporting technical baseline, including high level operational and system architectural views, and business case analyses.

3.4  Sea-Based Technical Baseline.  Allocate mission critical system functions, e.g., precision approach to major subsystem(s) and identify required subsystem performance parameters to support the capability. Identify candidate physical system components compliant with the allocated performance specifications. Use technical and business case analyses from Section 3.1 to support design selections. Treat major software functions, e.g., navigation solution, as individual components, assign to a software configuration item and estimate size and complexity.  Characterize and document the technical maturity of physical components (hardware and software) and support the OSD TRA process.

3.5   Reliability and Maintainability.  In order to update the Government R&M model, provide reliability block diagrams and simulations including:  the block diagram; dependencies; assumptions; failure rates and distributions; repair rate and distributions; related cost estimates; BIT methodology; and application used in the concept.

3.6   Sea-Based Program Management  

3.6.1 Program Plan.  Prepare a program plan to develop, integrate and test the technical baseline described by task in Section 3.4. The plan should address resource requirements, including labor, and time for each phase of the hardware and software design and development, integration and test. The program schedule should specify planned engineering development activities for each major subsystem, with a roll up to the top level program milestones.  

3.6.2 Systems Engineering Management Strategy.  Develop a systems engineering management strategy that outlines the overall method for performing the systems engineering process for the JPALS system. 

3.6.3 System Certification Plan.  Develop a proposed system certification plan for a Sea-Based landing system.  

3.6.4 Test and Evaluation Strategy.  Develop a TES to describe proposed test strategy and test phases (including M&S, ground, and flight testing) for the integrated system.  

3.6.5  Software Design and Development Strategy.  Prepare a software development strategy that provides a plan to derive requirements, develop a software design, perform software coding and unit test, perform software integration, and support system testing through all test phases of the program.  The plan should address resource requirements (to include labor phasing and development environment), software development schedules, software tracking metrics (both technical metrics and earned value metrics), configuration management, and software corrective action.  The software development plan should take into consideration emerging DoD information assurance and anti-tamper requirements.
 
3.6.6 Risk Assessments.  Develop a Risk Management Plan (RMP) and perform a risk assessment associated with realizing the technical baseline.  The risk assessment should address technology risks (e.g., risks associated with new science, exploring unknown physical phenomena and advancing the state of the art) as well as development risks (e.g., system integration, manufacturing, and software development based on well understood science). Develop a risk assessment for cost, schedule, and technical performance aspects of the program.  Risk assessments pertaining to staffing, external dependencies, programmatic, supportability and maintainability should also be included. Develop risk mitigation plans for any moderate or high likelihood/consequence risks.

3.7  Land-Based Growth.  Provide a description of the proposed JPALS architecture that will be developed to meet Sea-Based Increment 1 ground and aircraft system requirements. Explain your approach for expanding or modifying the proposed architecture to meet growth requirements to support future Land-Based incremental capabilities.  With reference to the CDD capabilities for each future increment, describe how the resulting architecture(s) would support Land-Based requirements including availability under jamming, civil interoperability, and mobile system deployability.  Discuss the use of MOSA and the ability to use common software and hardware.  Describe how the resulting architecture(s) will enable certification to be achieved for the Land-Based ground and airborne subsystems, and identify any technical issues which could have an adverse impact on certification.

3.8  Land-Based Category II/III Requirements and System Architectures.  The JPALS program has developed Guidance Quality (GQ) requirements for Land-based Cat I operations that were modeled on the civil (LAAS/GBAS) Cat I requirements.  The civil Cat I requirements were largely derived from Instrument Landing System (ILS) performance, but some recent proposals in the civil community have suggested that an extension of this ILS paradigm may not be the optimum method for determining Cat II/III requirements.  Assess the relevance of different GQ concepts to a Land-Based JPALS Cat II/III capability and access the ability of Land-Based architecture(s) to support Cat II/III.

4.0  CONTRACT INFORMATION

Contracts will be Firm Fixed Price using traditional FAR/DFARS/NAVAIR clauses.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation number is NIH-NIDDK-07-051 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-27.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  However, this solicitation is not set aside for small business.  It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH); National Institutes of Health (NIH); National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) to procure from Illumia Inc, 9390 Towne Center Drive, Suite 200, San Diego, CA 92121.  WG-30-503: Infinium Human Hap 550 Whole-Genome Genotyping Kit.  Each Sentrix Human Hap550 Genotyping BeadChip can process one sample and genotype > 550,000 local.  Each package contains ninety-six BeadChips, along with reagents for amplifying, fragmenting, hybridizing, labeling and detecting twenty-four whole-genome genotyping samples. The reagents are required for performing a whole genome association study in a Native American population. Infinium arrays are compatible with the Illumina Beadstation already installed in the LNG laboratory. To the best of our knowledge no other manufacturer produces a genotyping array that is compatible with this hardware, which requires us to obtain arrays directly from Illumina.  The Illumina reagent chemistry is preferred because the chemistry is compatible with the TECAN liquid handling robot currently in use in the laboratory. Use of Illumina arrays allows the experiment to be performed by LNG. The absence of suitable hardware for both running the arrays and scanning them would require that the arrays be run at another facility which increases the actual cost per chip. The Illumina 550K Whole Genome chip hip represents highest SNP density currently available and utilizes a haplotype maximization approach to SNP selection. Other vendors use a random SNP utilization approach to SNP selection and although using a similar number of SNP assays is unable to capture an equivalent amount of genetic information to the Illumina 550K array. The offeror must include a completed copy of the following provisions: 1) FAR Clause 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors ? Commercial; 2) FAR Clause 52.212-2, Evaluation ? Commercial Items.  As stated in FAR Clause 52.212-2 (a),  ?The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.?  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Technical Evaluation, Price, and Past Performance; 3) FAR Clause 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications ? Commercial Items;  4) FAR Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statues or Executive Orders ? Commercial Items, Contract Terms and Conditions ? Commercial Items; and 5) FAR Clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders ? Commercial Items ? Deviation for Simplified Acquisitions.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations however; all responses received within 15 days from the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition is based upon responses to this notice and is solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive acquisition. The offeror must include in their quotation, the unit price, the list price, shipping and handling costs, the delivery period after contract award, the prompt payment discount terms, the F.O.B. Point (Destination or Origin), the Dun & Bradstreet Number (DUNS), the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), and the certification of business size.    The clauses are available in full text at http://www.arnet.gov/far.

Current access information may be obtained by calling 1-877-RAPIDGATE (1-877-727-4342).  (a) Unless the contractor voluntarily participates in the Fast Access Gate Program (see the cla use entitled Identification Of Contractor's Employees  Fast Access Gate Program), commercial vehicle access to Fort Lewis will be allowed only at the Logistics Center Gate (Exit 123 from I-5) and through the D St. Commercial Vehicle Inspection Point on No rth Fort. Both gates are open Monday through Friday, excluding federal holidays.  These gates will be open for inbound commercial vehicle access and inspection between 0530 hours and 2100 hours.  These gates may be closed on weekends (Saturdays and Sundays ) and federal holidays.  On Saturdays, Sundays, federal holidays, and on other days on which these gates are closed, commercial vehicles must use the Main Gate (Exit 120 from I-5).  Main Gate is open 24 hours per day everyday. A visitor pass must be obtain ed.  All commercial vehicles will be searched.  The Contractor should anticipate delays in getting commercial vehicles on post.  The Contractor must also allow additional time for commercial vehicles to reach their destination by driving through Fort Lewis .  If the commercial vehicle is carrying a load of cement concrete or hot asphalt concrete for delivery, the driver shall notify the gate guard as soon as poss ible and request that the vehicle be given priority for being searched; however, the Government does not guarantee that the vehicle will be given priority.  On weekends large vehicles (needing greater than 12'-5 inch clearance) will require a time stamped searched label to gain access to North Fort Lewis.  Searched labels will be issued at the Main Gate, as appropriate.  Drivers needing access to North Fort Lewis must inform the gate guard that their vehicle is over 12'-5 inch in height and that they will r equire access to North Fort Lewis.  The driver will receive a briefing on proper procedures and a searched label.  The Contractor shall ensure that its drivers, including drivers of subcontractors at any tier, comply with the procedures as explained to the m for access to North Fort Lewis.  (b) If the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program, contractor vehicles may enter the installation through any fast access gate lane except at Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta.  During Force Protect ion Level Charlie or Delta, all contractor vehicles must enter through the Logistics Center gate or, if the Logistics Center Gate is closed, through the Main Gate.  All passengers in the contractor vehicle must have a fast access identification card; other wise, the contractor vehicle must enter through the Logistics Center Gate or the Main Gate, as appropriate and obtain visitor passes.  Once the Fast Access Gate Program is fully implemented, fast access gate lanes will be at the Main (Liberty) Gate, the 41 st Street Gate (North Fort Lewis), the East Gate, the DuPont Gate, the D Street Gate, the Logistics Center Gate, the Madigan Army Medical Center Gate, the Rainier Gate, the Transmission Line Gate, and the Scouts Out Gate.  The contractor shall use only tho se lanes specifically marked as fast access lanes.  (c) If the Fast Access Gate Program is terminated for any reason, the contractor will be allowed access only through the Logistics Center Gate or the D St. Gate or, when they are closed, the Main Gate unl ess the contractor is otherwise notified by the Contracting Officer.  Local clause 52.111-4132 states:  a.  Each employee who requires access to Fort Lewis to perform work under any contract, at any tier, must obtain either a fast access identification bad ge or a visitors pass to obtain access to Fort Lewis.  A fast access identification badge will only be issued to an employee, at any tier, if the employee requires access to Fort Lewis more than twice per week.  Contractor employees, at any tier, who requ ire access to Fort Lewis twice per week or less often or who do not participate in the Fast Access Gate Program shall obtain a visitors pass at the Main (Liberty) Gate or the Logistics Center Gate (or the DuPont Gate when the Logistics Center Gate is clos ed).  The visitors pass will be issued for a maximum of 30 days at a time.  A fast access identification badge will only be issued to contractor employees if the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program.  The Fast Access Gate Program is a v oluntary program.  b.  The contractor shall provide information as required by the Fast Access Gate Program contractor (FAGPC), to enable the FAGPC to conduct a criminal history background check (CHBC) on contractor employees who are to have access to Fort  Lewis.  The contractor is responsible for paying the FAGPC any set-up fee and the fee per employee for conducting the CHBC and issuing the fast access identification card.  If the CHBC is not adverse, a fast access identification badge will be issued by t he FAGPC to the contractor employee.  If the CHBC is adverse, the FAGPC is prohibited from issuing a fast access identification badge to the contractor employee.  If a fast access identification badge is denied for any reason, the contractor employee may o nly enter the installation by obtaining a visitors pass; however, if the contractor employee does not meet the criteria for being issued a fast access identifi cation badge, the Government may, in its sole discretion, decide not to issue a visitors pass to the contractor employee.  c.  If an employee no longer needs an identification badge for any reason (e.g., quits his/her job or no longer performs work under the contract), the contractor shall return the identification badge to the FAGPC within two (2) calendar days of such change.  If the identification badge cannot be returned within the required time frame for any reason, the contractor shall immediately no tify both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer verbally, followed up in writing the next work day.  An employees inability to obtain entrance to a Government installation because he/she does not have the required identification badge or visitors pass sh all not excuse timely performance of the requirements of this contract.  The FAGPC or the Government may change the location at which identification badges are issued or returned, with or without advance notice to the contractor.  Any such changes shall no t be a basis for adjusting the contract price under any clause of this contract.  d.  Fast access identification badges shall not be reproduced or copied by the contractor, its subcontractors, or their employees.  If an employees identification badge is l ost, stolen, or reproduced, the contractor shall verbally report the loss, theft, or reproduction to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer on the day such loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered, followed by a written report of the circumstances to  both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer within one (1) calendar day after the loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered.  e.  Each contractor employee shall wear the fast access identification badge while performing work under the contract.  The ident ification badge shall be worn on the upper front of the outer garment unless precluded by OSHA regulation(s).  The identification badge shall not be used for access to any Government installation except for performance of work under the contract for which it was issued.  f.  The contractor shall, upon expiration or termination of the contract, collect all identification badges and turn them in to the FAGPC. The final invoice will not be considered proper for purposes of the Prompt Payment Act (FAR 52.232-25  or FAR 52.212-4(i)) until all identification badges have been accounted for.  g.  If the Fast Access Gate Program is terminated for any reason, the contractor will be notified by the Contracting Officer as to whether the fast access identification cards w ill remain valid (and, if so, for how long) and which gate(s) may be used for access to the installation.  Local clause 52.111-4004 states:  In accordance with the FAR Part Two electronic commerce definition and FAR Subparagraph 4.502 (Electronic Commerce  in Contracting Policy), the Contractor shall communicate with the Government utilizing electronic mail.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals  are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The Electronic Proving Ground, Fort Huachuca, Arizona is soliciting proposals for the following requirement:  1 each, Rapid Scan Module for an Aeroflex CS35020-F with the following specif ications:  SOW -- Additional  BSA data collection mode.  It is desired to operate the broadband signal analyzer in a mode (Mode Rapid Scan) that enables a rapid scan over several (nominal) 60 MHz spectral bands, revisiting the entire set in as short a time  as possible.  It is believed that the process of retuning the receiver, allowing time for the local oscillators to settle, will take no more than approximately 50 milliseconds (msec).  If further detailed investigation indicates that the time required wil l be significantly longer, then this SOW must be revisited.  Mode Rapid Scan.  Rapid scan/ short dwell. (A schematic concept is available upon request.  The numeric values are illustrative only. )  The vendor will provide software that will Enable the oper ator to enter a table of up to 33 individual signal collection frequency bands of up to 60 MHz each in the range of 20 to 6000 MHz.  Each entry in this table will include a center frequency and bandwidth (or equivalent specification), as well as system gai n and/or RF attenuator settings to allow system dynamic range to be adjusted independently for each band in the table.  Allow the operator to specific a coherent dwell time interval ranging from 1 to 1000 msec in suitable increments (e.g. logarithmic incre ments:1,2,5&500, 1000).  Allow the operator to specify a total number of complete cycles through the band list for data collection in this mode.   This should permit the operator to fill the solid state memory in this mode.  At the operator's command comme nce to collect time series data on each band in the list for the specified coherent duration and then step automatically to the next band in the list, continuing till the entire list has been covered repeatedly for the specified number of cycles.  The data  collected will be recorded in the BSA solid state memory.  Enable the operator to quickly assess the validity of the data collected by providing calculations of the average and maximum signal levels in each band, along with the percentage of A/D conversio ns at full scale.  Enable the operator to copy validated data to a mass memory.  Enable the operator to skip step 5 and automate step 6 so data collection can proceed without operator intervention once instrument settings have been validated.  Enable the o perators', at a later time of discretion, to examine the data stored on mass media and perform additional quality control checks, including spectral analysis, signal level calibration, instrument settings, meta-data entries, etc.  It is intended that the o perator's be able to rapidly and conveniently switch data collection modes (standard and Mode Rapid Scan) as conditions and opportunities arise.  An SAS-260HV/12FS is required to support this data collection mission.  FOB Destination (Fort Huachuca, Arizon a 85613).  Payment will be made by Government Credit Card under Net 30 Terms.  Offers are due no later than 1200 hours, Wednesday, 15 November 2006 and shall be submitted electronically at virginia.miller@epg.army.mil.

<DESC>In order to better preserve competition and understanding of this requirement, the following questions and answers are posted for all interested vendors.  Additionally, as part of all proposals received, each offeror must acknowledge all amendments posted to the original solicitation.

1.      Under the terms of the contract it is stated that it is a ?Total Small Business? set aside.  Does this mean that a large organization cannot sub-contract to the small business in putting together a proposal? ? This means the prime contractor must be a small business.  In accordance with 13 CFR 125-6, the prime contractor must do 51% of the work.  13 CFR 125-6 describes how work is defined for purposes of the set aside. 

2.      Is there an incumbent, and if so what is the organization?s Name? - USIS is the current incumbent.

3.      How many secure areas/SCI Facilities (SCIF) are being manned? ? Please see Section C, paragraph C.10 of the solicitation.  

4.      How many SCIFs are required to be manned on a 24/7 basis? ? 24/7 manning will be on an as needed basis.  

5.      Is the program/project manager included in the hours requested? ? A program/project manager is requested to be identified in Section G.  However, it is up to each offeror how the program/project manager position is to be filled, whether it be an indirect charge employee, SSO also acting as PM, etc.  

6.      What is the number of key personnel? ? The number of key personnel is not specifically defined in this contract.  It is up to each offeror to decide which personnel are designated as key.  The number of lines at the end of the key personnel clause in Section H has no inherent meaning.  

7.      What is the start date of the Contract? ? The start date as envisioned is in Section B of the solicitation.  

8.      Under what wage classification on the Wage Determination would SSO fall?  The 27000 series lists Security Clerk.  Is this closest to the mark? ? The current contract does not contain a wage determination requirement as the position requirements fall more under professional services.

9.      Is this a new requirement or an existing requirement being re-bid? - The current contract is expiring at end of year.  

10.  If existing, what is the current billing rate for these services? - This information, if determined releaseable at all,  will only be released via FOIA request to TSA?s FOIA office as the current contract is ongoing.

11.  If this is an existing requirement, are incumbent personnel considered fully qualified for duty under the new solicitation? ? Any person currently working at a TSA facility has passed TSA?s background check and security screening requirements.    

12.  Are incumbent personnel, if existing, subject to a CBA or Wage Determination? ? See #8.

13.  What wage determination number is appropriate for this contract? ? See #8.

14.  Under what wage classification on the wage determination do SCIF personnel fall?  For example, under the 27000 series for law enforcement and security, security clerk is listed; is this the proper wage classification or is some other classification more applicable? ? See #8. 

15.  The solicitation, in the pricing section, indicates that travel is not to exceed $4000 per year?  Please clarify what type of travel this entry is referring to. ? Travel is related to Section C, paragraph C.4 tasking.  

16.  Is any type of uniform required for these services? ? No.
