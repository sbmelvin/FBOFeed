FPI 1000E1, IDENTIFICATION OF QUALIFIED LABORATORY AND SOURCE SAMPLING SOURCE SELECTION

Reference FAR Clause 52.246INSPECTION OF SUPPLIES FIXED(AUG 1996), paragraph (i) (1) AND (2), inspection of material to source sampling, the following clause titled: IDENTIFICATION OF QUALIFIED LABORATORY AND SOURCE SAMPLING is hereby incorporated into and made a part of this contract:

(a)	The offeror or bidder shall indicate in paragraph (e) below the name and address of the laboratory or laboratories where components or end items will be tested during the course of any resultant contract. A Qualified Laboratories List (QLL) is available through the Commander, DPSC, 2800 South 20th Street, Philadelphia, PA 19101, ATTN: DPSCPOL. Any laboratory proposed by the contractor not on the QLL is subject to the approval of the Contracting Officer.

(b)	The Government QAR will cut samples from a lot at the textile component source and send them for testing to the Qualified Laboratory (QL) cited below. (The acceptability of each lot will be determined through the testing of these samples). In addition, the QAR will simultaneously cut samples from the same rolls of material and send them to the DPSC Laboratory. For end items, duplicate samples will be drawn. Source sampling procedures are detailed further in DPSC Manual, Quality Systems Requirement, 4155.3, which is incorporated by reference.

(c) 	The prime contractor will notify the DPSC Laboratory in writing at least ten (10) days in advance when lots are to be presented to allow Government witnessing of QL testing. If the Government intends to witness testing, a representative from the DPSC laboratory will notify the QL. In the absence of Government notification, testing should proceed as scheduled.

(d)	If a laboratory is removed from the QLL during the course of a contract, DPSC will perform the required testing for up to 30 calendar days from the date of removal. The contractor is responsible for securing the services of another QL during this period. The charge for testing will be the DPSC Laboratory's effective cost rate on the date of testing.

(e) 	Any change in the laboratory (laboratories) specified below is prohibited unless approved in advance by the Contracting Officer:

	NAME AND ADDRESS OF LABORATORY: [                        ].
	COMPONENT IDENTIFY: [                                    ].
	NAME AND ADDRESS COMPONENT SOURCE: [                     ].

* When a single lot of material requires testing by more than one laboratory for difference characteristics, list the name of the secondary laboratory and test characteristics below:

	NAME AND ADDRESS OF LABORATORY: [                        ].
	COMPONENT IDENTIFY: [                                    ].
	TEST CHARACTERISTICS: [                                  ].

(f) 	It is solely the prime contractor's responsibility to schedule QL testing and to obtain test reports. The cost of QL testing shall also be borne by the prime contractor.

(g) 	Shipment of component materials to the prime contractor need not be deferred pending test results except when shade approval is required (see paragraph (h)). Cutting production lots without a passing QL test report on the corresponding samples is done at the contractor's own risk.

(h)	Shade evaluation is acceptance testing. Therefore, component lots may not be shipped to the prime contractor until the DPSC Laboratory accepts the shade of the material.	

Additional Requirements:

Upon receipt of the final decision in the protest, the Contracting Officer shall either- (1) Cancel the stop-work order; or (2) Terminate the work covered by the order as provided in the Default, or the Termination for Convenience of the Government, clause of this contract. (b) If a stop-work order issued under this clause is canceled either before or after a final decision in the protest, the Contractor shall resume work. The Contracting Officer shall make an equitable adjustment in the delivery schedule or contract price, or both, and the contract shall be modified, in writing, accordingly, if- (1) The stop-work order results in an increase in the time required for, or in the Contractor's cost properly allocable to, the performance of any part of this contract; and (2) The Contractor asserts its right to an adjustment within 30 days after the end of the period of work stoppage; provided, that if the Contracting Officer decides the facts justify the action, the Contracting Officer may receive and act upon a proposal at any time before final payment under this contract. (c) If a stop-work order is not canceled and the work covered by the order is terminated for the convenience of the Government, the Contracting Officer shall allow reasonable costs resulting from the stop-work order in arriving at the termination settlement. (d) If a stop-work order is not canceled and the work covered by the order is terminated for default, the Contracting Officer shall allow, by equitable adjustment or otherwise, reasonable costs resulting from the stop-work order. (e) The Government's rights to terminate this contract at any time are not affected by action taken under this clause. (f) If, as the result of the Contractor's intentional or negligent misstatement, misrepresentation, or miscertification, a protest related to this contract is sustained, and the Government pays costs, as provided in FAR 33.102(b)(2)  the Government may require the Contractor to reimburse the Government the amount of such costs. In addition to any other remedy available, and pursuant to the requirements of Subpart 32.6, the Government may collect this debt by offsetting the amount against any payment due the Contractor under any contract between the Contractor and the Government.

FPI 1000E1, IDENTIFICATION OF QUALIFIED LABORATORY AND SOURCE SAMPLING SOURCE SELECTION

Reference FAR Clause 52.246INSPECTION OF SUPPLIES FIXED(AUG 1996), paragraph (i) (1) AND (2), inspection of material to source sampling, the following clause titled: IDENTIFICATION OF QUALIFIED LABORATORY AND SOURCE SAMPLING is hereby incorporated into and made a part of this contract:

(a)	The offeror or bidder shall indicate in paragraph (e) below the name and address of the laboratory or laboratories where components or end items will be tested during the course of any resultant contract. A Qualified Laboratories List (QLL) is available through the Commander, DPSC, 2800 South 20th Street, Philadelphia, PA 19101, ATTN: DPSCPOL. Any laboratory proposed by the contractor not on the QLL is subject to the approval of the Contracting Officer.

(b)	The Government QAR will cut samples from a lot at the textile component source and send them for testing to the Qualified Laboratory (QL) cited below. (The acceptability of each lot will be determined through the testing of these samples). In addition, the QAR will simultaneously cut samples from the same rolls of material and send them to the DPSC Laboratory. For end items, duplicate samples will be drawn. Source sampling procedures are detailed further in DPSC Manual, Quality Systems Requirement, 4155.3, which is incorporated by reference.

(c) 	The prime contractor will notify the DPSC Laboratory in writing at least ten (10) days in advance when lots are to be presented to allow Government witnessing of QL testing. If the Government intends to witness testing, a representative from the DPSC laboratory will notify the QL. In the absence of Government notification, testing should proceed as scheduled.

(d)	If a laboratory is removed from the QLL during the course of a contract, DPSC will perform the required testing for up to 30 calendar days from the date of removal. The contractor is responsible for securing the services of another QL during this period. The charge for testing will be the DPSC Laboratory's effective cost rate on the date of testing.

(e) 	Any change in the laboratory (laboratories) specified below is prohibited unless approved in advance by the Contracting Officer:

	NAME AND ADDRESS OF LABORATORY: [                        ].
	COMPONENT IDENTIFY: [                                    ].
	NAME AND ADDRESS COMPONENT SOURCE: [                     ].

* When a single lot of material requires testing by more than one laboratory for difference characteristics, list the name of the secondary laboratory and test characteristics below:

	NAME AND ADDRESS OF LABORATORY: [                        ].
	COMPONENT IDENTIFY: [                                    ].
	TEST CHARACTERISTICS: [                                  ].

(f) 	It is solely the prime contractor's responsibility to schedule QL testing and to obtain test reports. The cost of QL testing shall also be borne by the prime contractor.

(g) 	Shipment of component materials to the prime contractor need not be deferred pending test results except when shade approval is required (see paragraph (h)). Cutting production lots without a passing QL test report on the corresponding samples is done at the contractor's own risk.

(h)	Shade evaluation is acceptance testing. Therefore, component lots may not be shipped to the prime contractor until the DPSC Laboratory accepts the shade of the material.	

Additional Requirements:

DPSCM 4155.3 TOXICITY REQUIREMENT - The contractor is responsible and must assure that all components are made from non-toxic materials.  The government reserves the right to verify that components are non-toxic in accordance with the following:

b.  As an alternative to animal and human testing, the contractor may provide information which certifies that components are composed of chemicals and/or materials which have been safely used commercially where prolonged skin contact has occurred.

APPROVED FINISHES:  The government is no longer responsible for publication of the list of approved finishes for textiles goods.  The contractor is responsible to assure that chemical substances used to finish textile goods are non-toxic in accordance with the above provisions.  All chemical finishes previously approved by the government for textile items do not require recertification of approval for use.  Any substances not previously approved by the government or significant changes in existing products shall require verification testing by the U.S. Army Testing Command, Aberdeen Proving Grounds, Edgewood, MD.

<DESC>This notice serves as a presolicitation notice/procurement synopsis for the AMRAAM AIM-120 future Lot buys (envisioned for Lots 20-24 (FY06-10)) production/sustainment program and software upgrade (SWUP) development.  The Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) Joint Systems Program Office, in preparation for its 20th production run of Air Intercept Missile (AIM)-120 missiles is envisioned to award sole source contract(s) for production/sustainment including Software Upgrade Program (SWUP)/System Improvement Program (SIP) (SWUP/SIP) for the AIM-120 variants.   SWUP/SIP includes the design, development, integration, and test improvements for production incorporation into the AIM-120 variants to maintain system effectiveness in future combat environments and Total System Performance Responsibility (TSPR) of the AIM-120 System which must meet the requirements of the AMRAAM Missile Performance Specifications (MPS).  TSPR is defined as the contractor’s acceptance of responsibility to do what is necessary and sufficient to deliver, warrant, and support missiles that are affordable, combat capable, and readily available.  
Any solicitation/award is anticipated to either incorporate a Long Term Pricing Agreement (LTPA) or be discreetly priced for any/all supplies and services necessary for the production/sustainment of the AIM-120 missile.  The solicitation/award is expected to include a basic period (Lot 20/FY06), and four option periods (Lot 21/FY07, Lot 22/FY08, Lot 23/FY09, and Lot 24/FY10).  Specific production/sustainment requirements, in addition to the underlying TSPR concept, may include, but are not limited to:  AIM-120C7 and AIM-120D missiles (USAF/USN/USA/USMC), AIM-120 missile variants authorized for release to Foreign Military Sales (FMS), sustainment (including repair and a Service Life Prediction Program), associated spares, support/support items [i.e., program management/engineering/logistics/test support, support equipment, spares, (FMS) offset administration and associated data.  Total missile production is expected to be from a minimum of 300 up to a maximum of 900 missiles per year.  Deliveries:  Lot 20/FY06 begins Oct 07 at a rate of approximately 25 missiles per month; Lots 21/FY07, 22/FY08, 23/FY09, and 24/FY10 at rates of approximately 40 per month.  Sustainment requirements are anticipated to include a 1 lot repair capability for each missile lot buy, that covers non-warranted missile and support item repair for each 12 month period.  Inasmuch as Raytheon Company, the current producer and sustainment provider of the AIM-120 missiles is in current production, the JSPO will not be able to provide government property/government special tooling/special test equipment/technical data package to any prospective new source.  Therefore the fulfillment of the supplies/services listed above requires substantial initial investment and an extended period of preparation for manufacture.  Anticipated date of letter of solicitation for Lots 20 – 24 production and sustainment is on or about Feb 05; date of closing response is on or about Mar 05.  
This acquisition is contemplated sole source under authority of FAR 6.203-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements (10 USC 2304(c)(1)) to Raytheon Company, 1151 E Hermans Rd. P.O. Box 11337, Tucson, AZ 85734-1337.  Should your firm desire subcontracting opportunities, contact Mr. Tom Gillman (Raytheon Co.) at the above address or phone (520) 794-9794. The date for response to this synopsis for the AIM-120 PRODUCTION/ SUSTAINMENT PROGRAM is fifteen (15) days after the date of this synopsis publication.  Facsimile responses or requests to the Contracting Officer at (850) 882-8050 are authorized if you also call and verify receipt.  Communication concerning this acquisition should be directed to Ms Margie Naylor, Contract Specialist, (850) 883-0161, or Ms Dana Sillars, Contracting Officer at (850) 883-0152, AAC/YAK, 207 West D Ave, Suite 622, Eglin AFB FL 32542-6844.

Through the rehabilitation of an historic federal building, this project continues the legacy of outstanding public architecture. In accord with this tradition, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission our nation’s most talented designers and artists to prepare our historic federal buildings for the next 50 to 100 years of service.  These projects are to demonstrate the value of integrated design that balances historic significance with current needs; balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; creates environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian federal employees; and gives public expression to our democratic values. In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of architectural/engineering design in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements.  As required by law, all facilities will meet federal energy goals and security requirements.  All projects will be LEED certified.


PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The project is the repair and renovation of the Robert S. Vance Federal Building and U.S. Federal Courthouse located at 1800 5th Avenue North in Birmingham, Alabama.  The building maintains a prominent presence in the downtown financial / business district and is a local landmark and the historic symbol of the Federal presence in Birmingham.  The historic structure is a four story marble and brick Neo-Classical style building constructed in 1921 with two floors added in 1926 and is approximately 17 350 gross square meters (gsm) 174,000 gross square feet (gsf) without parking.  There are no interior parking spaces.  The existing courthouse will maintain a total of four (4) existing courtrooms: one (1) historic district courtroom and three (3) bankruptcy courtrooms.   The building will house portions of the District, Magistrate and Bankruptcy Courts; U.S. Attorney; U.S. Marshals Service; U.S. Probation; Senators Field Offices GSA and other federal agencies. This project will provide superior workplaces for civilian federal employees, and shall serve as an example of successful historic preservation while making a distinct architectural statement that is responsive to the existing character of the building.  The design will follow the Secretary of Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings and Building Preservation Plan (BPP) guidance, respecting the existing historic character of the building while at the same time supporting the needs of a modern workforce.  GSA will contract separately during the design phase for Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) services and Construction Manager as Agent (CMa) services.  The CMc and CMa will be active participants in the design process to provide (in addition to the A/E):  construction expertise, estimating and cost information, and functionality and constructability reviews.

SCOPE OF WORK
The facility will be designed using English units of measurement with “soft metric” units shown in parentheses.  The scope of professional services will require at a minimum: professional architectural, landscape architectural, engineering, interior design, and related consulting services for clear and concise communication of the design intent to contractors who will construct the work.  The scope of work will require at a minimum:  metric design development drawings, specifications, cost estimates, schedules, value engineering services, life cycle costing, space planning, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD) and construction phase services (option to be exercised at a later date) for a facility that includes the renovations and alterations to the existing building and related systems, site development and parking, client program requirements, and sustainable features.  The facility must be designed to meet the energy goal established by GSA.  The design is also to include the GSA design standards for secure facilities; P100-Facilities Standard for the Public Buildings Services; the Courts Design Guide requirements; the U.S. Marshals design requirements, and any other agency specific guidelines as part of the design.  The design of the facility shall include sustainable design and construction practices following the LEED format with a requirement for Certification and will incorporate total building commissioning as defined by GSA design guides.

The CMc will be competitively chosen using Source Selection Procedures (FAR 15.3).  For this procurement, technical factors when combined are more important than cost or price.  
Project Summary:  Selection of the CMc – type firm will be in accordance with the federal acquisition regulations, source selection procedures and the “Best Value Trade-Off” process. All elements of work to be executed must be within the congressionally mandated cost limitation. As part of the CMc Pre-Construction Phase, the CMc shall work with the A E and the Government in a cooperative team effort to ensure a quality project, within the mandated schedule and budget. For the Pre-Construction portion of this contract, GSA intends to have the contractor perform services such as: preliminary evaluation of design concepts, monitoring A-E progress, coordinating design reviews, reviewing designs, reviewing cost estimates, preparing independent cost estimates in various formats, controlling schedules, keeping records, reporting on design and construction progress, resolving problems, conducting Value Engineering (VE) exercises, conducting constructability reviews and performing administrative and other services as defined in this scope of work, in addition to other related services deemed necessary to provide for a completely functional facility.  For the Construction Phase of this project, the major work items include the Restoration of the Exterior Building Plaza, Installation of a New Fire Life Safety System and Upgrading Existing HVAC and Building Automation Systems. Construction will be phased and the building will be occupied during construction process.  All building systems will remain in operation during construction and the project phased to avoid disruption of occupants. The Total Estimated Construction Cost range is $25 million to $40 million.  Of the Total Estimated Construction Cost, the Plaza portion of the work is estimated to be in the $12 to $15 million range and the HVAC and Fire Life Safety work is estimated to be in the same $12 to $15 million range. The construction duration will be approximately 30 months. This amount or duration does not include Pre-Construction Phase services (Base Contract). CURRENTLY FUNDS ARE NOT AVAILABLE FOR THE BASE CONTRACT. 
Definition of Construction Manager as Constructor:  A CMc contractor is defined as a firm engaged under direct contract to a building owner or client (in this case the GSA) to provide services such as design review, cost estimating, sustainability review, scheduling and general construction services.  The services requested of the CMc shall cover a wide range of design and construction activities which are often performed by both Construction Managers (CMs) and General Contractors (GCs).  In contrast to a CM that is not also a constructor; the CMc is at risk and is involved with project development and administration of the construction.  The CMc shall be a member of the project development team during the design and construction phases, working with the A/E and the Government to ensure a quality project, within the mandated schedule and budget.  The CMc contractor will perform services including, but not limited to:  evaluating design concepts, monitoring A-E progress, coordinating design reviews, reviewing designs, reviewing and preparing cost estimates, controlling schedules, keeping records, reporting on design and construction progress, conducting Value Engineering (VE) exercises, conducting constructability reviews, constructing the facility at or below the defined budget or Estimated Construction Cost at Award (ECCA), administering the construction contract and all subcontracts, coordinating construction meetings, CPM scheduling, monitoring construction costs and performing administrative and other services as defined in the scope of work to provide for a completely functional facility.  At the time of the CMc contract award, which is projected to coincide with the Design Development Phase, project development shall occur in general conformance with the process described in the American Institute of Architects Document A121/CMc (also known as AGS Document 565) and “Standard Form of Agreement Between Owner and Construction Manager Where The Construction Manager Is Also The Constructor”.

A “best value, trade-off” process will determine which offer is in the best interests of the Government.  For this procurement, technical factors when combined are more important than cost or price.  The Government reserves the right to make an award based on initial proposals without conducting negotiations.

Technical Evaluation Factors:  Proposals will be evaluated using a two stage, source selection process.  Under Stage 1, offerors must submit information regarding qualifications, past experience, past performance, personnel, and management plan.  Submissions shall clearly address the evaluation factors identified in the Stage 1 Request for Proposal (RFP) as well as pricing for pre-construction and contruction.

<DESC>CDC, NIOSH, National Personal Protective Technology Branch intend to negotiate on a sole source basis a purchase order to the Wheeling Jesuit University, National Technology Transfer Center (NTTC).  The proposed contractor is the only known responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  With experience in the identification, assessment, and commercialization of marketable research and technologies, the NTTC is uniquely positioned to assess relevant technologies, identify partners and facilitate partnerships that will provide all of the expertise necessary to successfully complete the project.   The purpose of the contract is to fund the NTTC, WV to collect literature on advanced efficient technologies for the development of an advanced self-contained self-rescuer (SCSR) system, conduct workshops/meetings with stakeholders/technology developers to discuss SCSR user needs, analyze various efficient technologies and select appropriate technologies for improving the SCSR system.  The new system must be small and light weight, provide optimum oxygen generation and carbon dioxide scrubbing, and have a long shelf-life that can be monitored.  The ultimate goal is the creation of a commercial product that supersedes the current capabilities of the state-of-the-art SCSR technology.  The scope of work is available, if requested.  This is not a request for quotation and no solicitation is available.  Firms that believe they can provide the required services are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the date of this synopsis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Inquiries may be sent to Margaret L. Mooney  by e-mail at zia3@cdc.gov.  This acquisition is being processed under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.

<CONTACT>Tina M. Landes, Contract Specialist, Phone (321) 867-1500, Fax (321) 867-4848, Email Tina.M.Landes@nasa.gov
<DESC>NASA/KSC plans to issue a Request for Quotations (RFQ) for the following Commercial item/services:	Beta Testing of SINDA/G – GFSSP Interface.   Task Description / Objective: The Mission Analysis Branch of the Launch Services Program at NASA KSC has the responsibility to ensure that the predicted thermal environments associated with each launch vehicle are met.  In general, the Launch Service Provider (LSP) performs the necessary analyses to predict the thermal environment; however, incidents arise where the NASA Launch Services Program (referred to as the Program hereafter) will perform independent verification and validation (IV&V) analyses.  When the Program dictates said analyses, adequate modeling tools are necessary.  In order to provide efficiency, it may be necessary for tools to interface directly with each other.  Such is the situation between two of the codes used by the Program’s thermal team: SINDA/G (Systems Improved Numerical Differencing Analyzer / Gaski) and GFSSP (Generalized Fluid System Simulation Program).  SINDA/G is one of the industry standard, commercially available, heat transfer codes.	GFSSP, co-winner of the 2001 NASA Software of the Year, is a MSFC developed fluid network code.  Currently, the Program’s thermal team has built off of earlier work at MSFC (developed by a current member of the Program’s thermal team) to provide a link between these two codes in order to provide an integrated conjugate heat transfer capability for SINDA/G.   The development of the interface has matured to a point where independent testing is necessary to ensure proper functioning.  Beta testing of the interface is necessary to ensure its proper functioning via independent testing from an end user perspective.   The purpose of this task is to identify, independently develop conjugate models and exercise the interface in order to work out programming bugs and deficiencies prior to release to the community at large.  Upon successful completion of this beta testing, the coding, user documentation and supporting testing documentation will be released to the public through the KSC technology transfer program. The contractor will supply labor and necessary infrastructure (computer and necessary basic software) to perform the testing; whereas, the Government will supply the interface with basic documentation as of the start of the task.  The contractor will identify, develop requisite models, and conduct the aforementioned beta testing and supply to the Launch Services Program the results of the testing in a final report.  The final report will serve as a contract deliverable. Requirements of the Contractor:  The individual assigned to perform the testing must have a background in the following areas: -  Expertise in Fluid Mechanics    -  Including: compressible and incompressible flows,  -  Expertise in Thermodynamics    -  Including: multiphase, equilibrium and non-equilibrium transient thermodynamics -  Expertise in Heat Transfer    -  Including: conduction, convection (both forced and natural/buoyancy driven), and radiation -  Proficient in SINDA/G -  Expertise in the computer language FORTRAN -  Significant background on spacecraft thermal requirements    -  Spacecraft-launch vehicle interface thermal requirements       -  Prelaunch and launch phases -  Knowledge of thermal requirements/constraints (demonstrated acceptance and qualification levels) for the launch vehicle, such as Delta IV, Atlas V, or Pegasus. The following background is highly desirable in the individual assigned to perform testing: -  Expertise in numerical modeling of fluid behavior    -  Including: one dimensional, unsteady flows    -  Working knowledge of the FLUINT half of SINDA/FLUINT -  Experience with expendable launch vehicle, and/or spacecraft research and development centers within NASA (GSFC, KSC, MSFC, JPL), in any of the following capacities:  direct employee, contract employee, etc.   Travel Requirements: None anticipated. Deliverables and Milestone Dates: Deliverables include monthly status reports and a final technical report. Anticipated project milestones: Obtain training on GFSSP 3.0:  4/2005 Identify classical convection benchmark cases:	4/2005 Identify case(s) of interest to Launch Vehicles/Payloads:  4/2005 Prepare benchmark thermal and fluids models (including interface connections):	5-8/2005 Provide feedback on modeling (incl. errors/bugs/suggestions) via weekly activity report:  5-8/2005 Prepare thermal and fluid models for case(s) of interest to LV/SC:  7-8/2005 Prepare final report on BETA testing:  9/2005 Delivery of final report on BETA testing activities:  9/2005 Weekly activity reports (bullet list of work performed and planned) _____ The NAICS Code and Size Standard are 541710 and 500 employees, respectively.   The anticipated release date of RFQ No. NNK05103401Q is on or about 3/25/2005 with an anticipated bid due date of on or about 4/8/2005. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency. An ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA Specific Note "B".

POSITION DESCRIPTION

1.	Background


Nicaragua will carry out national elections in November 2006.  This will be the fourth general election since the restoration of democratic rule in 1990.  As such, the election of 2006 will be a consolidation election rather than a transition election.  Despite this, the last election in November 2001, revealed a number of flaws in the process of registering voters and conducting the elections. Most notable were problems with the preparation of voter rolls and the delivery of voter identification documents.

USAID/Nicaragua wishes to contract with an individual under a Personal Services Contract (PSC) to plan, manage and monitor a significant set of USAID-funded Elections and Political Processes (EPP) related activities.  The contract will be for 20 months (subject to availability of funds).  The contractor will be stationed in Managua, work from the USAID/Nicaragua offices in the USAID compound, and travel as necessary outside the capital city.  

The Democracy Initiatives technical office staff consists of one Foreign Service Direct Hire, one USPSC (EPP Advisor), and four Foreign Service Nationals.

2.	Specific Duties and Responsibilities

The USAID/Nicaragua Elections and Political Processes (EPP) Advisor has a broad range of strategic, programmatic, administrative, and coordination responsibilities pertaining to the implementation of USAID’s extensive EPP and governance activities in Nicaragua.  Management and provision of technical assistance to EPP activities require attention to an array of substantive issues including but not limited to: strengthening the ability of the GON, political parties, and civic representatives to more effectively advocate for and assist in the implementation of electoral and governance processes that are more transparent, competitive, open and efficient including election-related activities as well as a range of governance endeavors that may include anti-corruption/transparency efforts and military transition to civilian control, among others; enactment and implementation of appropriate amendments to the electoral law; preparation of the voter rolls and the delivery of voter identification documents; improving the enforcement of elections procedures; better oversight of the electoral process; more informed and increased voter participation; strengthening the relationship between political parties and their constituencies and improving parties’ representation of constituency interests; strengthening the democratic management and organization of political parties; and donor coordination and collaboration including the establishment of a donor coordination group for the November 2006 election.

4.

These documents should be well written and timely, requiring no editing or minimal editing; 

5.	Provide performance monitoring and evaluation of EPP programs and ensuring acceptable performance and attainment of defined objectives of USAID activities.  S/he must oversee the collection of EPP performance monitoring data, reviewing to ensure data quality, timeliness, and on-going utility of the data for documenting program performance and identifying management issues.

6.	Engage in public outreach and coordination.  The advisor will team with USAID Mission public outreach/relations staff in the development of briefing materials for public outreach.  In addition, the Advisor must maintain dialogue with in-country partners, customers, and stakeholders as well as relevant Washington stakeholders to build their support for the Mission’s EPP activities.

This performance evaluation will include a review of program objectives as well as the performance of the Contractor.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) has a requirement for development of molecular genetic markers to assess hybridization between Cyprinella species.  The award of a fixed price contract will be for 12 months.  The U.S. EPA intends on soliciting Duquesne University as the sole candidate  pursuant to FAR 13.106 (b) - Soliciting from a single source for the (1) development and validation of an adaptable set of mitochondrial (mtDNA) genetic markers to study the present and potential invasion genetics of red shiner hybrid swarm in Alabama and Georgia;  validation will involve use of the markers with a variety of southeastern Cyprinella species to assess whether the markers are species-diagnostic (2) Application of the mtDNA markers to characterize the red x blacktail shiner hybrid swarm in the upper Coosa River system (3) Application of the mtDNA  markers to evaluate single versus multiple introduction events in the upper Coosa River system.  The work encompassed by these three tasks will directly support the EERD invasive species project (Task #19121) entitled, "Invasion Dynamics of Red Shiner (Cyprinella lutrensis) Across Southeastern U.S.  Watersheds".  All three tasks will support project objective #2: molecular genetic characterization of hybridization between red shiners and native congeners.  This action is being pursued on a sole source basis because the development of molecular genetic markers to assess hybridization between  Cyprinella species involves special expertise and training.  No other candidates, during a 3 month period of market research, were identified with sufficient expertise and training to undertake the aforementioned tasks.  NAICS Code 541710 applies with a small business size standard of 500  employees.  The intent of this notice is to determine if any other sources(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available.  Consequently, any response failing to provided the aforementioned data and instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will be  ignored.  Interested parties who can meet the above requirements may submit written qualification statements, fully explaining their capability no later than 15 days after the date of this publication.  Submit response to the U.S. EPA, Attn: John Southerland Jr (MC-E105-02), RTP Procurement  Operations Division, research Triangle Park, NC 27711.

<SUBJECT>39 -- Request for Information (RFI) from Industry for a Submarine Launched Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile (SLIRBM) Launcher Subsystem (SLS)!
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-GPO381249
<RESPDATE>033105
<ARCHDATE>04152005
<CONTACT>Thomas Heilig, Contract Specialist, Phone 202-764-1704, Fax 202-764-2162, Email SPN62@SSP.Navy.Mil - GERARD MISKELLY, Contract Officer, Phone 202-764-1706, Fax 202-764-2162, Email GMISKELLY@SSP.SPHQ.NAVY.MIL
<DESC>17.1.	BACKGROUND:

SSP is assessing the feasibility of developing the Launcher subsystem necessary to support the SLIRBM mission.  SSP has developed baseline programmatic and technical information necessary to conceptualize the SLIRBM Launcher Subsystem (SLS).  SSP requires input from industry resources to refine their understanding of the technical feasibility, risk and cost implications associated with this effort.  Specifically, this RFI documents a Government request from industry for the preliminary conceptual design and rough order of magnitude cost information associated with SLS development and production.   
2.	DISCUSSION

2.1	The SLIRBM

The SLS shall be designed to accommodate multiple SLIRBMs within the SSGN missile tube.  Preliminary missile design information is available in the SLIRBM RFI Contractor Data Augmentation Request (RFI Solicitation Number 08252003-0358).  For purposes of design of the SLS, preliminary SLIRBM specifications are as follows: 

			Total Length = 32 ft ± 1 ft
			Missile Diameter = 31.5 in +1 in/-1.5 in
			Gross Lift-off Weight = 15,000 lbs

The development of the SLS is to include a four-year program for a sea-based (though not from a submarine) system demonstration/risk reduction flight test, with design and production to follow.  

2.2	Information Requested:  Provide conceptual technical information, comments and ROM cost assessments for the following items:

1.	Concept of Operations (CONOPS) and associated operational scenarios to be employed for SLS concepts.  Design should minimize required SSGN platform modifications for SLS integration.  Launch preparation, maintenance and downtime should be minimized.  Ability to launch the missile from a wide range of depths, speeds and sea conditions should be optimized, but design should emphasize a low-cost approach.  Minimizing cost of the SLS shall be a predominant programmatic consideration.  Ideas that limit CONOPS in favor of cost savings should be considered.

2.	Methods to mechanically support SLIRBMs in the SSGN missile tube (MT) including a discussion of the technical advantages and disadvantages of encapsulated missile (e.g., All-up-Round Canister) and bare missile (e.g., Trident D5 Launcher) concepts.

3.	Discussion of the expected trade space available for lateral/vertical support and retention and how this space may be impacted if two, three or four SLIRBMs are to be integrated in each SSGN MT.

4.	Mitigation of shock, minimization of vibration transmission and discussion of the proposed method for systems level shock qualification.

5.	Approaches for converting the SSGN to/from a SLIRBM strike configuration and replenishing (i.e., refurbishment and reload) fired weapons.  Responses should address potential trades that will facilitate reduced conversion/replenishment timelines.

6.	Release/eject mechanisms including a discussion of the feasibility of “cold gas” vs. traditional gas generator concepts.  Responses should emphasize “cold gas” launch as a potential lower life cycle cost alternative to an ordnance-based gas generator.  Discuss potential operational limitations (e.g launch depth) of a cold gas eject mechanism relative to gas generator.  CONOPS limitations that result in significant cost savings will be considered when finalizing an approach for missile eject.

7.	Methods for providing services to the missile including tube pressurization/environmental control, communications and power. Responses should be sure to address the technical feasibility of both wireless and wired (i.e., an umbilical cable) communications/power concepts.

8.	Closure design concepts including a discussion of the technical feasibility and cost implications associated with domed, flat, hard-shell and fly-through closure variations.

9.	Discussion of the challenges associated with the release/ejection, underwater trajectory and post-broach flight of a SLIRBM.  Include comments on feasible approaches for mitigation of adjacent launch affects and debris fallback.

10.	Design to Cost concept for an affordable design and life cycle support cost.

The response shall comment on requested design considerations.  Discuss items that are not clear or may be construed as overly restrictive.  If appropriate, recommend additional capabilities or considerations that may not have been documented in the RFI.  

Ensure that response adequately addresses the following:

a.	Description of concepts (Use drawings, diagrams, etc. as necessary).

b.	Technical advantages, disadvantages and perceived implementation risks associated with these concepts.

c.	ROM development costs for proposed, four-year demonstration program.

d.	If necessary, provide the rationale for concepts that may have been difficult to fit within the specified system architecture.

3.	STRUCTURE FOR RESPONSES

Contractors should respond to this RFI in writing and should provide their responses both in electronic and hardcopy form.  Limit response to a maximum of 150 pages.  One electronic copy of the response shall be provided in PDF format and must be received by the specified due date.  Contractors shall also submit five hardcopies to the Government.  The hardcopies must be typewritten on single-sided 8½” by 11” paper with one-inch margins on all sides and double-spaced text, and bound in standard binders.  Use 12-point font with normal (uncondensed) spacing.

4.	INFORMATION EXCHANGE MEETING

The Government reserves the right to arrange an Information Exchange Meeting(s).  These private sessions would provide a closed forum for individual contractors to share proprietary conceptual information with the Government. The exact format and date of these meetings has yet to be determined; however, the decision to hold an Information Exchange Meeting will be based on the number of requests to participate that are received. 

5.	LEGAL DISCLAIMER 

This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes.  It does not constitute a solicitation and should not be viewed as a request for procurement.  All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned. The responses will not be considered offers and will not be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Responders are solely responsible for their expenses associated with responding to this RFI.

<DESC>Subject to final approval, the Bureau of the Public Debt, Administrative Resource Center  intends to award a sole source purchase order for the Inter-American Foundation (IAF) to Harvard University, Hauser Center for event coordination and tasks described herein. 

The Inter-American Foundation (IAF) requires a sole source contract with Harvard University, Hauser Center, for this project.  Harvard is the only qualified entity that can carry out the multiple tasks described herein. Of particular interest are the following qualifications of Harvard University in regards to this requirement: 

The Hauser Center for Nonprofit Organizations.  The Hauser Center for Nonprofit Organizations is an interdisciplinary research center at the John F. Kennedy School of Government (KSG) at Harvard University. Based in Cambridge, the Center seeks to expand understanding and accelerate critical thinking about nonprofit organizations and civil society among scholars, practitioners, policy makers, and the general public. 

The Center aims to illuminate the vital role the voluntary nonprofit sector plays in aiding societies to discover and accomplish important public purposes. Faculty and researchers at the Center help equip policy makers and nonprofit leaders with the knowledge and tools they need to develop to their full potential. The Hauser Center is well known and highly respected among members of RedEAmérica for its multiple programs and initiatives in Latin America. 

Harvard’s power to convene:  IAF through BPD intends to task Harvard to plan a CEO Hemispheric Workshop in the summer of 2005 to bring together business leaders from the Americas to discuss and promote grassroots development (GRD) as a strategy for poverty alleviation. High attendance to this important event will depend in great part on who convenes the meeting. Business owners and CEOs will be asked not only to give of their time to attend this event but also to pay their own travel, hotel, and other expenses. Harvard University (the Hauser Center in conjunction with the Business School) has a unique power to convene such a meeting. In addition to the general world-wide prestige of Harvard, the university is especially known and respected among Latin America business leaders for multiple programs and initiatives that it has carried out over the years with these leaders. Harvard’s power to convene business leaders in the America’s can be linked to multiple efforts, including the Program on Philanthropy, Civil Society and Social Change in the Americas (PASCA) created to better understand to the role of private philanthropy and of organized civil society in the development of Latin America. 

Broad multi-sector expertise of Harvard: The Hauser Center will be able to tap into other relevant units within the university, and in this way directly contribute to quality, state of the art products. These are:

-The Corporate Social Responsibility Initiative (CSR) at the Kennedy School of Government. This initiative is a multi-disciplinary program that undertakes research, education and outreach activities to study and enhance the public role of private enterprise.  It focuses on exploring the intersection between corporate responsibility, corporate governance and strategy, public policy, and the media.  The CSR Initiative is a cooperative effort between the Center for Business and Government, Hauser Center for Nonprofit Organizations, Center for Public Leadership and the Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy.  
-The Social Enterprise Program in the Business School. Includes the following Executive Education Programs that will contribute to capacity-building for business support to GRD:
1. Governing for Nonprofit Excellence (GNE): Critical Issues for Board Leadership is an Executive Education program developed at Harvard Business School to help maximize the contributions of nonprofit board leaders. Three distinguishing characteristics of GNE are: (a) A strong leadership focus—reflected in both the level of participant experience and the issues that the program addresses; (b) The effectiveness of Harvard Business School's interactive approach to learning; and (c) Harvard Business School faculty who combine extensive research and experience in board leadership and nonprofit management with world-class teaching expertise. 
2. Performance Measurement for Effective Management of Nonprofit Organizations (PMNO): is an Executive Education program developed by Harvard Business School's Social Enterprise Initiative and the Hauser Center for Nonprofit Organizations at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government. PMNO enables nonprofit leaders to address the challenging work of measuring the performance of nonprofit organizations. Specifically, the program focuses on the strategic use of performance measurement to improve the key areas of management concern, such as resource allocation, organizational learning, internal processes, and internal and external accountability.
3. Strategic Perspectives in Nonprofit Management (SPNM) Effective nonprofit leaders face many challenges in successfully leading their organizations. First, there has to be clarity regarding the mission itself—they have to define the very reason that the nonprofit exists. Then, there are the pressures to become more professionally managed, and to articulate and achieve bottom-line performance objectives that are pertinent to the organization. All of this must be undertaken in the context of shifting demands for services, changing operating environments, and recurring financial pressures.

NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT IS AVAILABLE.  Public Debt will consider all affirmative responses received no later than April 7, 2005.  Affirmative responses shall reference IA-12000-05-0002 and shall be accompanied by sufficient documentation to clearly show the ability to provide the required services or functional equivalent at terms more advantageous to the Government.  Requests for more information or a copy of the solicitation will not be considered affirmative responses.  If no affirmative response is received that clearly demonstrates the ability to meet all requirements and that it is more advantageous to the Government, a sole-source purchase order award will be made to the Harvard University-The Hauser Center for Nonprofit Organizations, 5 Bennett Street,
Cambridge, MA02138.

<DESC>DESC:  The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), in conjunction with the Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (ACSIM), Northeast Region (NERO), plans to offer the privatization of the water and wastewater distribution systems at Aberdeen Proving Ground and Edgewood, MD.  Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements.  As a result of this solicitation, the firm will be selected to assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility systems.  The successful firm will be required to provide expansions to the system to meet future needs of the government.  The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility systems.  The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the systems to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility systems in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract. Offerors will not be required to submit offers on all of the utility systems and may submit offers on individual system(s) or on groups of systems on an all or none basis.  For purposes of economic comparison required by 10 U.S.C. 2688, each system will be analyzed and considered for award separately.

The Utility System being privatized is described as follows:

INSTALLATION DESCRIPTION:
 
Opened in 1917, Aberdeen Proving Ground – Edgewood Area (APG–EA) is the Army’s oldest active proving ground. Located approximately 35 miles northeast of Baltimore on a 69,000-acre tract extending along and into the Chesapeake Bay, APG–EA is home to the U.S. Army Test and Evaluation Command, and is home to approximately 50 tenant activities with a daytime population of about 10,000. 

Utility Systems to be privatized: The following is provided only to give an approximation of the size, scope, and general description of the system.  Any numbers should only be used for estimating purposes.  The following system parameters are approximations.

Description of Facilities:  The utility systems consist of the following estimated Capital assets:

A.   Potable Water System Description
The APG-EA potable water system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to the system. The system may include, but is not limited to, water source treatment facilities, pump stations, pipelines, valves, fire hydrants, storage facilities, and meters. The actual inventory of items sold will be conveyed to the Contractor using the Bill of Sale at the time the system is transferred. 
Water Source
APG-EA is supplied potable water from two sources. One source is the Winters Run River and the other is from Harford County.
The water from Winters Run River is withdrawn from the river, treated and supplied to the water system. Water from Harford County is supplied as potable water and is directly supplied to the water distribution system without any further treatment.
Winter Run River Water Supply
On the Winters Run River is a small dam, Van Bibber Dam. The dam has an approximate height of 15 feet. The dam backs up water in the river so it can be withdrawn through the plant’s intake structure into the APG-EA water treatment plant. Van Bibber Dam consists of an ogee weir, outlet structure, and a fish ladder.  The dam provides very little reservoir storage capacity. The dam and water treatment plant were initially constructed in the 1940s.
The design capacity of the water treatment plant is 4.0 MGD; however, due to equipment constraints the actual capacity is nearer 2.0 MGD. The average daily water production at the plant is approximately 1.0 MGD. The plant is manned 24 hours per day, 7 days a week.  
The plant is manually operated but has a SCADA system that provides information to the plant operators. The system provides turbidity of the inlet and finish water, headloss across each sand filter, operating status of finish water pumps, and the water level in the Hanson Reservoir.
Distribution System
Facilities within the boundary of APG-EA are supplied with potable water by the network of water pipes. All potable water supplied to APG-EA is via the 10-, 14-, and 24-inch lines from Hanson Reservoir. The pressure reducing valves on each of the supply lines near the northern edge of APG-EA reduce the pressure to 55 psi as it enters the APG-EA water distribution system.
The potable water distribution system is interconnected at various locations to create a looped distribution network. Most of the lines were installed in the 1940s and only minor additions or upgrades have been made to the system since then. The system is considered to be in poor to average condition with some section of lines considered to be in unacceptable condition. One section of 8-inch pipe along Otto Drive has five repair clamps on it. Generally, there are an adequate number of water valves at the pipe junctions to isolate sections of pipes for maintenance. However, many of the valves are reported to be in poor condition. The valves in the 5000 area are reported to be in unacceptable condition. Recently, many of the repairs to the water system have been completed under pressure, as isolation valves that would normally isolate the line could not be closed.
B.  Wastewater System Description
The wastewater system at APG-EA consists of collection lines, lift stations with force main, and a wastewater treatment plant. At some of the outlying facilities wastewater flows to septic tanks, and drain fields for treatment and disposal. The actual inventory of items sold will be conveyed to the Contractor using the Bill of Sale at the time the system is transferred.
Collection Lines
The wastewater generated generally flows from the facility to gravity collections lines where it flows to the wastewater plant located in the southeast portion of APG-EA. Some collection lines flow to lift stations where the wastewater is pumped to a gravity line through which it flows to the wastewater treatment plant.
Most of the wastewater lines at APG-EA were installed in the early 1940s. The most common type of collection pipe material is vitrified clay and the most common pipe diameter is 8 inches. Since the 1940s only minor areas have been added and there have been only minor upgrades within the system. From 1988 through 1995, approximately 30 percent of the collection lines have been relined.  
The wastewater collection system consists of pipe sizes raging from 1.5 inches to 30 inches. The total length of the pipes is 39.5 miles. 
The Contractor shall comply with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations governing the operation of the water and wastewater distribution systems.

Objective

<DESC>On December 17, 1999, the President signed legislation (P.L. 106-170) establishing the Ticket-to-Work and Self-Sufficiency Program.  Under the Program, the Social Security Administration (SSA) has a requirement to contract with vendors to become employment networks (ENs), with responsibility for the coordination and delivery of services necessary to prepare and place beneficiaries in employment.  The purpose of the Ticket Program is to provide disability beneficiaries more choices for receiving employment services and increase provider incentives to serve these individuals.  Under the program, SSA will provide disability beneficiaries with a Ticket they may use to obtain employment services, Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) services or other support services from an EN of their choice.  The Ticket-to-Work and Self-Sufficiency Program has been phased-in nationally (including the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico) over a three-year period.  Implementation of the Ticket Program has been accomplished in phases.  Phase 1 began in 2001 and Tickets were distributed beginning in February 2002 in 13 States:  Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Massachusetts, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, Vermont, and Wisconsin.  Phase 2 began in 2002 and Tickets were distributed beginning in November 2002 in 20 States (and the District of Columbia):  Alaska, Arkansas, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi,  Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Tennessee, Virginia, and the District of Columbia.  Phase 3 began in 2003 and Tickets were distributed beginning in November 2003 in 17 States (and U.S. territories and possessions):  Alabama, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Utah, Washington, West Virginia, Wyoming, American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.  As SSA continues to release Tickets based on new accretions to the disability roles, this solicitation will remain open continuously until further notice.  Contractors serving as ENs will be responsible for an array of duties including, but not limited to: (1) providing appropriate employment services, VR services or other support services consistent with the successful attainment of a clients employment goal(s), either directly or by entering into contracts or agreements with other providers of such services; (2) providing the client with a comprehensive explanation of the service offered, as well as the ENs responsibilities to its clients; (3) developing jointly with the client an Individual Work Plan (IWP) that defines the clients employment goals(s) and outlines the services and supports necessary to achieve and maintain that goal; and (4) reporting data to SSA on specific client outcomes achieved through the provision of services, a statement of finances, and other management information data.  Offerors will be evaluated in accordance with the Statement of Work, accompanying Response Pages, and required documentation.  It is anticipated that each contract will be for a 5-year term, with one 5-year option period.  The Request for Proposal (RFP), SSA-RFP-05-0010D, will be available for downloading on March 7, 2005 from the Federal Procurement website at www.fedbizopps.gov.  HARD COPIES WILL NOT BE MAILED.  IF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS REQUIRED, PLEASE CONTACT THE SSA PROGRAM MANAGER CONTRACTOR, MAXIMUS, AT 1-866-968-7842.  FOR THE HEARING-SPEECH IMPAIRED, CALL 1-866-833-2967.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Numbered Note 1. Applies: The U. S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) intends to acquire the services to design, deliver and install a professional office environment for existing leased trailers located at  853 Chandler Street, Fort Detrick, MD 21702. The solici tation number is W81XWH-05-T-0300.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this noti ce.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The requirement is restricted and being procured as a 100% small business setaside. The solicitation document and incorp orated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 01-16.  The NAICS code is 337214; small business size standard is 500 employees.  The Contract Line Item Numbers(CLIN): 0001 Individual Office workspace; 0002 Cont ract Specialist Workspace; 0003 Procurement Technician Workspace; 0004 Common Area space; 0005 Conference Room; 0006 Cabling; and 0007 Moving and Cleaning in accordance with the following Statement of Objectives (SOO): A.  General.The USAMRAA desires a com fortable, professional  work environment for 39 individuals in leased trailers across the street from its main offices.  The trailer configuration and dimensions is available for review at www.usamraa.army.mil; select RFPs not online and look for Attachme nt 1 to W81XWH-05-T-0300. The contractor shall design, deliver and install a professional office environment for the trailer complex.  The design should be modern, open, interesting, and professional.  The design should encourage collaboration, yet offer a  modicum of privacy and noise attenuation features.  Partitioned, high-walled cubicles are not desired.  The complete office environment shall include workstations (including work station lights, pencil drawers, mouse pads, keyboard trays, and tack boards) , chairs (desk, visitor and conference), filing systems (for workstations and common areas), tables, bookcases or any other item of office furnishing  needed to produce a turn-key delivery.  B.  Workforce Description.  1.  The workforce occupying the trail er complex will be comprised of two organizational units.  Unit A will be comprised of a supervisor, two contracting officers, 14 contract specialists, and four procurement technicians, for a total of 21.  Unit B will be comprised of a supervisor, two cont racting officers, 12 contract specialists, and three procurement technicians, for a total of 18.  The total number of individuals/workstations in the trailer complex is 39.  Offerors should consider this a minimum number of occupants for the trailer comple x.  Designs that can reasonably and comfortably accommodate more than 39 individuals, providing these organizations opportunities for growth, will be seen as positive enhancements.  2.  The two supervisors and four contracting officers will occupy the six separate offices indicated on the floor plan.  The contractor shall provide a suitable, professional office environment for each separate office.  The separate offices should be able to accommodate at least two visitors comfortably and facilitate collabora tion between the office occupant and his or her visitors.  3.  The remaining 33 work spaces should be located by organizational unit to the extent practicable.  Contract specialists work primarily on the computer and on the telephone.  They require filing space for assigned contracts and reference materials.  They need enough horizontal workspace to comfortably lay out contract files and manuals.  Contract specialists frequently work collaboratively with customer representatives, other specialists, contract ing officers and supervisors.  Designs should facilitate this collaboration by providing space and a chair for at least one vis itor for each contract specialist workstation.  Procurement technicians maintain files and perform administrative tasks associated with contract management.  They dont have to store files at their desks, but each technician may have actions to perform on multiple contract files at any one time.  Procurement technicians also have desktop computers to send and receive email and check status of various contract management systems.  Technicians make frequent use of printers, copiers, and facsimile machines.   C.  Current Space Utilization.  1.

<DESC>1.  Does this solicitation include the people to operate the plant, or just the training of people there? 
ANSWER:  Yes the contractor needs to include the labor costs to operate the plant as well.

2.  Before we can submit a serious time line and articulate an offer with the possible variants you are open to, we would need till April 1st, 2005. Is this deadline acceptable?
ANSWER:  1 APR 05 will probably be too late.  But if the offer has not been filled by then and it is still in the open market then the vendor is free to bid.

3.  With Baghdad as our departing point, what sort of arrangements do you offer for visiting the sites? Can you indicate where the sites 
are?

The equipment will become the property of the US Government.  It is the intent of the government to purchase the water capabilities while having the contractor run the operation.

7.  Will the government provide electrical power for these water plants in all locations? 
ANSWER:  The Government will provide all power at Government expense.  

8.  Will there be a charge for government supplied power? 
ANSWER:  No.  The contractor needs to provide its own power generation sufficient enough to run the bottling capability at each site.  If prime power is available, the government will provide unimpeded access.
 
9. Will the government provide suitable wastewater disposal facilities? 
ANSWER:  The contractor will be required to provide all equipment associated with bottling water capability.

ANSWER:  The contractor is responsible for maintenance.  Structural defects or upgrades to the foundation will be the responsibility of the Government. 

11.  What power sources will be available or will our units need to have their own generators using local diesel fuel?  
ANSWER:  A back-up to the actual power source provided by the Government is a good idea in case of an outage or disturbance.  The contractor needs to supply the sufficient amount of power generation in order to run the bottling capabilities.  If prime power is available, the government will provide unimpeded access.  Government will provide the fuel necessary to operate any generators or equipment requiring fuel.
 
12.  Are there bottle blowing plants in Iraq that we would have access to for liter bottle supply or will they have to be transported in from abroad? Which gets back to the convoy transportation issue that you are wanting to avoid.  
ANSWER:  I have no information to provide you on this, however, you can team up with another company that can give you the item.  The contractor will be responsible to provide all equipment and transportation of that equipment into Iraq in order to produce the requirement at each site.  Convoys from the south can integrate into other convoys for security escort up to desired locations.  Once bottling capabilities are at their respective sites, the contractor will not be responsible to distribute the bottled water to units.  

 
13.  To confirm our interest in participation what will be required of us, i.e., letter of interest with all pertinent contact info and corporate officers by March 11? Or is another document required?  
ANSWER:  This will suffice, a Request for Quotation/ Proposal will be forthcoming in the next few weeks.   
 
14.  Is there a working telephone number that you can be reached at? 
ANSWER:  Phone numbers will not be provided at this time.  During the RFQ/RFP phase, contact numbers will be provided.

17.  Storage of bottles raw material (perform), caps, labels etc.- should we provide storage container(s) for 14 days or  (? ? ) days stock 
ANSWER:  Contractor needs to stock sufficient amounts of material in order to be able to meet the requirements at each location for bottling water.  That will be vendor dependent.

18.  Storage of bottled water should we provide roofing or tents for this purpose
ANSWER:  That will be vendor dependent.  Our intent is to minimize construction.  We want to stay away from as much as possible any fixed facilities.  

19.  Do you prefer fully automatic production or semi automatic with employment of local workers.
ANSWER:  However you decide to run the operation is up to you

20.  Can we consider that the maximum production will be during 3 shifts and minimum in 2 shifts. 
ANSWER:  However you decide to run the operation is up to you.
This will be vendor dependent.  As long as the vendor can meet the requirements per day, then the vendor has met the intent.  
  
21.  We have to provide bottled water capability as requested , start up, production run test and train the personnel, we understand that we will not be responsible for the production and supplying of raw materials for bottled water production, if  we should produce bottled water then specify the period of time. For bottled water production certain quantities of bottles raw material (perform), caps, labels, chemicals for water treatment etc. should be supplied on a regular basis.
ANSWER:  The contractor is required to supply all equipment and supplies in order to run the operation to meet output requirements.

22.  Can you provide any details on the Inlet Feed Water that the contractor will be required to purify? (i.e. Quality, Quantity, Source etc.) 
ANSWER:  The government will be responsible to provide sufficient quantities of untreated water to produce the required amounts of bottled water.
Water is untreated water from either river, canal, or well.  As for analysis, this is Iraq so think the worse conditions.

23.  Do you expect the facility to run 24h/7/365?
ANSWER:  As long as the output requirements are reached, the contractor can run the operation as he/she sees fit.

24.  Is there a consideration on frequency and volume of supplies delivery? Specifically, do you expect the contractor to make plastic bottles with caps out of raw plastic (which at most requires quarterly deliveries)  or buy bottle forms and caps?  
ANSWER:  All production must be accomplished at the site.  If plastic bottles are to be transported in, the Government will not assume responsibility for convoys nor provide convoy security.  It is at the contractor's risk.

25.  Similarly, should a maximum of spare/replacement parts be included with the original shipment to minimize future deliveries? 
ANSWER:  It is the contractor's responsibility to maintain the plant operational to meet the required output per day.  

26.  The smallest line is 3000 bottles per hour, and it includes about 5 modules from bottle preparation to marking and packaging. It requires at least 300kW/h of energy, compressed air and ice-cold water supply. Is it provided on the site or the contractor must build facilities for those too?
ANSWER:  the contractor is required to provide all requirements for the production of the output requirements.  Power will be provided by the Government.  A backup system is a good idea to have in case of power failure or disruption.  The contractor is responsible to provide the necessary power generation to power the bottling capability.  If prime power is available, the government will provide unimpeded access.
 
27.  Is the building/warehouse provided or the contractor builds one according to the line specifications?  
ANSWER:  Contractor is to provide the building. The contractor is responsible to provide all equipment necessary to produce the requirements at each specified location.
 
28.  If the facility is re-locatable, is the contractor responsible for relocating it on demand? How long is such a commitment? Is the relocation expense included in the contract amount? What is the time expectation on relocation?
ANSWER:  Yes, the contractor is responsible to re-locate at the request of the Government.  If bottling capability is relocated per government request once the sites are established, the government will incur the transportation costs to relocate.  The contract is for one year with several option years (Firm Fixed Price).  Relocation time has not been defined yet.  

29.  Given the complexity of the equipment (electronic/mechanical parts), the manufacturer will void the warranty if equipment is moved by a third party. In some instances, the equipment will not survive the move. What is the consideration for those? Must the contractor then replace those modules at his own cost? 
ANSWER:  The contractor is responsible for the maintenance and repair of equipment along with the relocation of such said equipment. 
 
30.  The contractor expects to purchase/lease the necessary equipment from various international sources. The manufacturer usually installs the equipment, which translates into a team of engineers who will come to assemble and fine-tune the production line. Any restrictions on countries?  
ANSWER:  Due to the nature of this product only countries that are not considered hostile and or are considered friendly to the Multi-National Force will be allowed to compete

31.  Once the line is up and working, who will maintain and operate it? Is there an expectation that the contractor must maintain certain presence on all sites? If so, for how long? 
ANSWER:  The contractor is responsible for the maintenance, repair, and operation of all facilities for the duration of the contract terms and conditions. 

32.  Installation takes about a month. Where will the engineering team reside, eat, etc? What are the considerations for coming and leaving the country?
ANSWER:  The personnel will be given life support by the Government.  Transportation costs will be the responsibility of the contractor.

33.  When do you think is the last date to accept offers?
ANSWER:  There is no requirement with the RFI to submit an offer.  The RFQ/RFP will soon be out, at which time it will indicate when proposals are due.  

34.  when is the last date for site surveys? Where? How if the locations is limited to only badge carriers and military only? Please explain?
ANSWER:   If the vendor is capable in meeting all the government’s requirements and timeline, site survey visits will be worked out with the potential vendors.

35.  Is it one location supplying all other locations, or it might be more thean one producing location? 
ANSWER:  Each site identified has a specific requirement that the government needs to be met.  There are 8 different producing locations.

36.  Is it an opened competition for all companies from all countries (except the terrorist countries) or limited to some restricts, as it was limited to Turkish companies?
ANSWER:  This is an opened competition to any vendor that is able to meet the requirements and timeline of the government.

37.  The contractor will be responsible for providing the purification equipment placed on site, continuing operation and the government will purchase the water produced for a period of one year, with option years to be determined. At the end of the contract period the government will own all facilities. During the operations period the contractor will be responsible for and all operations, maintenance, power supply, disposal of waste water, and any other necessary items to provide continuation of water production.

42.  Question 3 , Are you saying that if power is available there will be no cost to the contractor, but if for some reason the /government cannot provide power that the contractor must provide their own power at their own expense?  
ANSWER: The contractor needs to provide own power generation…i.e. generators.  The contractor should add that into there price.

43.  Will the government provide fuel for contractor supplied generators? 
ANSWER: Yes the government will provide all fuel.

44.  Will the government provide any assistance to the contractor in setting up each purification facility? Like equipment to unload etc.

ANSWER:  Answer:  Currently nothing is on site…but the contractor is able to contract such things from the local area.

46.  Shall the contractor supply all bulding materials and skilled workforce (electricians, plumbers, painters, etc) to build the required facilities? 
ANSWER:  The contractor will supply all building materials and skilled workforce.  But it is the government’s intent that these water capabilities are not fixed – permanent sites.

47.  What is available in terms of basic utilities: running water (tech-grade), electric power, drainage/sewage, garbage disposal, etc.

ANSWER:  Yes the government will furnish fuel for power generations.

ANSWER:  Yes there will be site visits

50.  Are there any space restrictions? For a location 6 with the output of 318K liters/day, it may need up to 100K sq. feet. 
ANSWER:  Spacing is limited, however, the Government will work with the contractor to make it happen.  

51.  What are the clearance requirments for personnel to install and operate this ffacility? 
ANSWER:  Clearance requirement will be basic criminal back ground checks.
  
52.  Will the Government be interested in training their own personnel to operate this facility?

53.  Since this equipment is not to be left in country after completion of the contract, will the Government be interested to install it in some other locations or the contractor assumes full responsibility for proper disposal / sale to interested parties outside of the country. 
ANSWER:  The equipment will become Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) at completion of the contract

<DESC>PERFORMANCE DECISION ON STREAMLINED COMPETITION (CONTRACT AND GRANT CLOSEOUT) under solicitation no. DOL051RP20017. A-76 FINAL DECISION- This is an announcement of results of the recent Department of Labor (DOL), Employment and Training Administration (ETA), Office of Financial and Administrative Management, streamlined competition of the Contracts and Grants Closeout Unit function that included such positions as financial management specialist and closeout specialists. DOL has completed a streamlined competition for accounting services support (contracts and grants closeout function) in accordance with OMB Circular A-76. On March 3, 2005, the streamlined competition form (SLCF) was certified by the Source Selection Authority and the Contracting Officer, indicating the study completion. As a result of this study, performance of this function will remain in-house (performance by incumbent Government personnel totaling 3 Full Time Equivalents (FTEs)). Of the three FTEs that were compared (Closeout Specialist, Grade GS-13, Series 1101; Closeout Specialist, Grade GS-11, Series 1101; and Financial Management Specialist, Grade GS-9, Series 501), two FTE positions (GS-13 and GS-11) became vacant during the course of the competition. ETA may or may not elect to fill the vacant positions and execute a letter of obligation (LOO) in the future based on organizational and resource considerations. In accordance with the revised OMB Circular A-76, effective May 29, 2003, no party may contest any aspect of this streamlined competition. A copy of the SLCF shall be made available upon request.

<DESC>The Naval Air Terminal utilizes a 2,500 square feet cold storage facility to store 463L pallets loaded with perishable cargo in Building LP-205.  A forklift is used to load the pallets onto the system.  The pallets are then manually positioned in the cooler via a non-powered roller deck.  The roller deck consists of a ball transfer system along with standard gravity roller conveyors.  The ball transfer system runs down the center of the cooler and allows the pallets to be moved in any direction.  The gravity roller conveyors extend from the sides of the ball transfers and are primarily used for final storage locations.  The requirement is to provide and install a new ball transfer system for the Naval Air Terminal Cold Storage Facility in Building LP-205.  The installation of the new ball transfer system should include the removal of activity’s current ball transfer system.  The new ball transfer system shall be capable of conveying loads weighing 10,500 pounds distributed over a 108-inch by 88-inch area without damage or permanent deformation to the conveyor system or pallet.

<DESC>TEMPORARY DESALINATION PLANT, FULLY OPERATED, FOR PRODUCTION OF 450,000 GALLONS OF POTABLE WATER AT THE USCG LORAN STATION AT PORT CLARENCE, ALASKA.  The U.S. Coast Guard is surveying the market for interest and availability, and possible options in regards to the following requirement:  The USCG LORAN Station at Port Clarence, Alaska is in need of a temporary desalination plant onsite and operationally capable of producing 450,000 gallons of potable water in no more than a 60-day treatment period starting no later than July 1, 2005.  The total dissolved solids in the seawater is 31,700 mg/L.  Pre-treatment of the water prior to contact with reverse osmosis membranes may be required due to concerns related to biological fouling.  The Coast Guard has received information that a Reverse Osmosis plant on Little Diomede Island, near Port Clarence, has had a problem with biological fouling of membranes.  The portable plant must be delivered to Kodiak, Alaska where it will then be transported to Port Clarence via C-130 aircraft.  Thus, the plant must be capable of breaking down into components which can be loaded inside a Coast Guard C-130 aircraft for transport - the C-130 cargo hold is 41 feet long by 8.75 feet wide by 8.75 feet tall - the contractor must allow for crating, palletizing and loading clearances to fit the plant within the available cargo hold space.  The C-130 maximum payload is 32,623 lbs and the maximum load per axle is 12,500 lbs.  Treatment plant must be fully self-contained with all necessary equipment, filtration, pumps, water hose, power generation, and manpower to successfully operate.  Existing Facilities Information: The remote U.S. Coast Guard facility is located near Point Spencer, Northwest of Nome, Alaska.  The station has access by air or water only. There is no road access.  Existing water storage tank capacity on site is 450,000 gallons.  Facility and water storage tanks are approximately 2,000 feet from the ocean beach.  The station will have depleted its potable water supply by early August 2005.  Production of potable water must begin prior to depletion of the existing supply.  The total production of 450,000 gallons must be completed by September, before onset of winter.  The station has chlorination equipment on site for chlorination of product water prior to use by station personnel.  Wastewater from the water treatment plant shall be discharged into the ocean.  The CG will provide food and lodging on site for water treatment operating personnel. There will be a charge of approximately $15 per person per day for meals.  Supplemental Information:  Bering Sea water from the bay will be the raw water supply.  Saltwater temperatures are expected to be between 35 and 50 degrees Fahrenheit during the summer.  Potable water output shall meet State of Alaska potable water quality standards.  The U.S. Coast Guard, in conjunction with the contractor, will work with the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (ADEC) to get the necessary permits.  Information Requested:  Interested vendors are asked to provide information regarding company background relating to similar projects/services; type of water treatment system that would be proposed based on the expected water quality, and water temperature information provided by the Government; capabilities and output of proposed water treatment plant; ability to meet the required timeline; system set-up information such as water intake, wastewater discharge, piping/pump systems to pump water to the storage tanks; and information regarding personnel who would operate the plant.  Provide information via fax, email or mail to Ron Klaudt, USCG Civil Engineering Unit, P.O. Box 21747, Juneau, AK 99802-1747.  Technical questions should be addressed to Kevin Darvell, phone (907) 463-2406, fax 463-2404; email kdarvell@cgalaska.uscg.mil.

<DESC>GENERAL INFORMATION

This is a Request for Information (RFI) only as defined in FAR 15.201(e) to obtain information about market information or capabilities for planning purposes.     This RFI is not a request for competitive proposals; therefore, responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.     

GENERAL INTENT

The Multi-National Forces - Iraq (MNF-I) contracting office at Camp Victory South, Iraq needs information on contractors that have the demonstrated capability to implement cell phone roaming agreements and provide carrier interconnect services.  The objective is to establish service in the form of one-way roaming and interconnect agreements with several telecommunications companies in Iraq.  These services will provide expanded connectivity to users of US Government (USG) GSM cell phone services, and USG wired phones in the Iraq AOR, to reduce costs, improve call quality and quantity for MNF-I forces throughout the Iraq AOR.

The primary focus of this request is to help identify a contractor that can provide:
1.	Scaleable, integrated, interconnects for Primary Rate services between the USG Avaya switch located at the USG Embassy Annex (Baghdad, Iraq), the Iraq Telephone and Postal Company (ITPC), and with the three largest Cellular Carriers in Iraq (Iraqna, AsiaCell and Atheer).
2.	One-way Roaming agreements to enable USG GSM cell phone users to roam on the networks of the three largest Cellular Carriers in Iraq (Iraqna, AsiaCell and Atheer). 

The goal is to secure a service that will establish interconnect and roaming agreements with the aforementioned carriers to expand the calling capabilities of MNF-I personnel throughout the country using both GSM Cell phones and wired telephones. This capability is needed to reduce the number and costs of International calls made within Iraq.  The contractor shall provide for the procurement, management, implementation, installation, configuration, maintenance, and detailed billing to operate both Roaming and Interconnect capabilities.
    
This RFI provides interested contractors an opportunity to present to the government their ideas, an approach, and capabilities to interconnect with the aforementioned carriers.  Responders that demonstrate the needed capabilities will be entered into a sources database and given the opportunity to compete on any future request for quote or request for proposal that results from this request for information.     

SUBMISSION OF DOCUMENTATION

Responses to this request must be received by the Government no later than close of business 2:00pm PST 10 Mar 05.     Responders shall provide one electronic copy (Microsoft Word or .pdf formats ) ten pages or less.  A page is defined to be one side of an 8.5 x 11 inch piece of paper with information on it.     Minimum print size is 10 point type, or 12 pitch.     If any information submitted is considered to be proprietary, then those pages should be marked accordingly.

Interested parties who have the capabilities to meet this need are asked to respond to SMSgt Michael Lemke via email at Michael.Lemke@iraq.centcom.mil with the time line and point of contact to include phone number and email address on or before 2:00pm PST 14 Mar 05.

<DESC>The following ammendment 0001 is made to W151KN-05-X-0438 to extend the date for submission of responses until April 7, 2005 and to clarify the requirement  for XM1068 as follows: ENHANCED 12-GAUGE NONLETHAL POINT ROUND, XM1068 MARKET SURVEY The U.S. Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command, Armament  Research, Development and Engineering Center (RDECOM-ARDEC), Picatinny Arsenal,  NJ is currently seeking sources for the manufacture and delivery of the  Enhanced 12-Gauge Nonlethal Point Round, XM1068.  This round will replace the  existing M1012 and is designed to provide an effective nonlethal point control  measure on a targeted individual through kinetic energy upon impact.  Unlike  the M1012, the XM1068 has an extended range of 5 meters to 30 meters  (threshold) and 1 meter to 75 meters (objective.)  The XM1068 point round shall  be a nonlethal device that produces enough non-explosive and non-fragmenting  kinetic force upon impact to create an intense stinging effect. TACOM-ARDEC is also interested in a point round that is a nonlethal device that  releases a visible, brightly colored, non-red substance that when seemingly  removed, maintains indelible UV properties up to three days (threshold) and  five days (objective) later in order to identify individuals with a device that  detects the stain. The Enhanced 12-Gauge Nonlethal Point Round shall be size-compatible with the  12-gauge utility pouch (GSA# GSAATIEAUPMS) and shall be transportable by  soldiers over all environmental domains.  The Enhanced 12-Gauge Nonlethal Point  Round must be compatible with the Mossberg 590, and will also be tested using  the Winchester 1200, Mossberg 500, Modular Accessory Shotgun System (MASS), and  the Joint Services Shotgun (XM1014). The probability of hitting an E-Silhouette  at the maximum effective threshold ranges should be at least .80 (threshold)  and .95 (objective.)   All responsible, interested sources are encouraged to submit their  capabilities/qualification data. The literature received from interested  candidates shall describe its functional and characteristics.  Request that any  prospective offers submit their literature no more than 30 pages within 30 days  from the date of publication of this notice.  Submittal of information is  requested via electronic mail only to Terry Niederhaus, Contract Specialist, US  ARMY TACOM-Picatinny, AMSTA-AQ-APD, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ; voice 973-724-3362;  e-mail at: tnieder@pica.army.mil no later than 30 days from date of this  notice, by April 7, 2005.   All information is to be submitted at no cost or  obligation to the Government. This is only a Market Survey Notice, not a Pre- Solicitation notice. If a formal solicitation is generated at a later date, a  solicitation notice will be published.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes the fulfillment of Public Law 2319 and is the periodic announcement of a Qualification Requirement, which is available for the repair of the Tactical Air Control System IF Receiver Circuit Card Assembly, NSN: 5998-01-281-0635ZR, part number 1D27308G01, AGAV END ITEM ID: AN/TPS-75 Radar.  The Intermediate Frequency (IF) receiver circuit card receives 32 MHz IF TARGET RETURNS from the radar antenna.  Each CCA acts as a separate channel.  The gain of each IF receiver card is varied dynamically by the STC ATTENUATION DATA (7 total) from the STC/Height calibration function.  The IF receivers receive an unencoded 32-MHz (COHO) signal from the transmitter/frequency generator/driver function.  The IF receivers use this signal as a reference to generate in-phase and quadrature-phase radar target detection analog signals, which are converted to 12-bit digital signals RADAR TARGET DETECTION DATA.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center, Aircraft Division, Patuxent River, MD plans on making an award for provision of access to specification and standards content from Standard Developing Organizations (SDOs). Such organizations will include but not be limited to the American Standards Associations, Civil Aeronautics Authority, Japanese Standards Associations, Underwriters Laboratories and other organizations listed on attachment A – “Acronyms” located on the NAVAIR website   "http://www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations/solicitation_view_action.cfm?Sol_No=N00421-05-R-0086".  Such SDOs will be grouped into related application groups such as aviation, ships, facilities, automotive, etc. but still be available through use of a single portal system to users across the entire country (USA). The system shall not be reliant on existing government portals but will be compatible with NMCI and other DOD computer systems.  

Access will be made available, in order of priority, to Naval Aviation, US Navy, and DoD customers. The government intends to utilize available commercial resources and any such system will not require Government funds for development. 

It is anticipated that a contract will be awarded for a Basic year, one or more Option years and one or more Award Term years (not to exceed 10 years) and that Contract Line Items (CLINs) will be by application utilizing stepladder quantities (by CLIN) in order to establish a long term government/contractor relationship, a stabile environment for such services without interruption, and the opportunity for expansion as requirements increase during the contract period of performance.  An informal estimate is that the value of the intended requirement is approximately $350 million over a 5-year period, not evenly distributed. 
  In order to verify and validate capability, a functional demonstration during source selection will be conducted. Letters of intent with SDOs will be required by the date the solicitation period closes. Availability of the system will be expected not later than 30 days after date of award.  
Interested parties are asked to contact the Contract Specialist, Miriam-Ellen Bonk, at miriam-ellen.bonk@navy.mil by 2:30 pm 22 March 2005. Respondees providing an email address along with point of contact information, including company name, address and phone number, will be added to the list of potential sources, and will receive in return, a request for proposal, which will be reviewed by the agency.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Cornell University (123 Day Hill Ithaca, NY) to continue performing woodchuck evaluations of candidate Hepatitis B therapies under the authority 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  The contractor shall provide a continuous supply of native controls and woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) chronic carrier woodchucks for therapeutic evaluation.  The Contractor will develop protocols for optimal in vivo testing.   Animal protocols may include optimizing dose requirements, preparing samples for pharmacokinetic analysis, determining efficacy and safety of drugs/immunomodulators approved for screening, assessing drug-drug interactions with other therapeutic candidates, performing all relevant assays, and preparing final reports of study results to suppliers.    Cornell, an experienced hepadnavirus drug evaluator, with an AAALAC-accredited colony of woodchucks will test NIAID assigned therapeutics for efficacy and safety against the diseases caused by hepatitis B infection. All woodchucks will be bred in the colony—not wild-caught—to prevent inadvertent complications by coinfections. Some of the newborn pups will be set aside for controls and for replenishing the breeding colony. Most new pups will be infected with a well-characterized pool of WHV and followed for the first six to nine months to determine if chronicity occurs.  Chronic carriers will be used for assessing efficacy, safety, optimal dose, and pharmacology. The Contractor will work with the NIAID staff and reagent sponsors to prepare optimal protocols, perform the experimental studies including assaying samples and analyzing results, and generate a final report. The Principle Investigator and contract staff should have published successes at performing these preclinical studies in woodchucks. The proposed award represents a continuation of work originally awarded to Cornell University under Contract N01-AI-05933 in 1999. Institutions which believe they have the requisite ability to perform this requirement may provide a capability statement identifying their business type e.g. educational institution, small business, large for-profit, etc.and a contact person and phone number within 45 days of this announcement. See Numbered Notes 22 and 26.  No collect calls will be accepted. Questions regarding this action may be submitted to Brenda K. Lee on 301-402-2443.

<DESC>The Maritime Administration is conducting a survey of the availability of Contractors qualified and capable of providing the Maritime Administration with technical support and administrative oversight services relating to the advance planning for and project management of the decommissioning, dismantling (partial) and remediation of the primary nuclear reactor and its associated components aboard the nuclear steam ship N.S. Savannah.  A Level of Effort type contract consisting of reimbursable type line items (CLINs) as a well as firm fixed priced line items (CLINs) is anticipated for these services. 

A target date for commencing the decommissioning, decontamination and radiological remediation (DDR) is October 1, 2006.  The ultimate goal of the project is to free release the N.S. SAVANNAH and complete termination of its NRC license, thus rendering the N.S. Savannah, inclusive of its nuclear power plant, suitable for use as a national maritime museum.

The N.S. Savannah’s nuclear plant was rated at eighty (80) megawatts and has been “partially” decommissioned.  As part of a temporary lay-up, the reactor’s fuel rods were removed in 1971.  Once it was determined that the vessel would no longer be engaged in commercial operations; the reactor’s primary coolant was removed in 1975 as part of its permanent lay-up.  Since that time, as required by NRC regulations, annual radiological surveys have been performed.  In addition, the Maritime Administration has conducted annual material condition surveys, drydocked the vessel and performed hull gaugings.   As a precursor to the decommissioning, a comprehensive characterization survey of the reactor pressure vessel, the containment space and components therein, as well as secondary spaces near or adjacent to the containment vessel, is currently being performed. .
 
Those firms possessing the requisite qualifications and capabilities should respond to this Sources Sought Announcement on or before April 15th, 2005. The response should include, as a minimum, the following:

(1) Corporate/Company Information inclusive of Point of Contact 
(2) Current Qualification and Capabilities (Technical/Personnel/Support Services)
(3) Project Management, Scheduling/Cost Estimating and Documentation/Reporting
(4) Prior Related Type Contracts (Government and Commercial) 
(5) Past Performance Evaluations and Sources (Points of Contact) for (1) through (4)

For each of the above, the response should specifically address the following technical elements:

(a)	Advance DDR Planning/Project Scheduling/NRC Document(s) Preparation and Review 
(b)	DDR Scheduling and Cost Estimating
(c)	DDR Environmental Assessment
(d)	DDR Contract Oversight
(i)	Site Environmental Monitoring
(ii)	Waste Management
(iii)	Disposition and Tracking of Nuclear Materials
(iv)	Emergency Response
(v)	DDR Contractor Performance Assessment
(e)	NRC License Termination Requirements and Process

In compliance with the requirements of 10 CFR Part 50 and Part 70; responders to this survey shall also provide evidence that they currently possess a Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) approved Quality Assurance Plan(s).

It is requested that responders limit their response to no more than twenty-five (25) pages.

Responders are herein informed that a two-day site survey of the facility and preliminary information briefing will be conducted between April 11-22, 2005 at the conclusion of radiological characterization surveys to be performed onboard the  N.S. SAVANNAH.  The briefing will be held at MARAD’s James River Reserve Fleet in Ft. Eustis (Newport News), Virginia, and will include a physical inspection of the onboard reactor system.   Responders will be provided with notification of the exact dates and further details at least two (2) weeks prior to the survey/briefing.

<DESC>Information Needed SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS:  The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), Western Federal Lands Highway Division (WFLHD) is conducting a market survey for a software development toolkit with the following capabilities:
   - Vector graphics primitives  (lines, curves, fills, etc.)
   - Incorporation of images from external sources.
   - Place text at specified locations in pages displaying multiple fonts, and attributes such as color, size, style, and emphasis.
   - Justify blocks of text at specified locations on a page.
   - Work with multiple pages in arbitrary order during document creation.

The software development toolkit is necessary to provide a convenient programming interface for C & C++ programming language to format and output data to a portable document format (PDF).   (Note: The release version of the software will be used to create original documents “from scratch”. The purpose is not for conversion of existing documents to a PDF format.)

When partially or fully integrated into the “release” version of applications, the release software version must be redistributable without any royalty or copyright obligations.

The focus of the programming efforts will be on Materials testing and Quality management, not PDF per se: therefore the software development toolkit should provide a scalable high-level interface to maximize programmer productivity, as well as, such low level capabilities on an as needed basis.

This software development toolkit will be used to:
Assist in the creation of QL-PAY reports; and in the creation of MLT reports (Interim and Final Reports on Sample, SACA report, TLBA report, SNW, etc, for display, printing, online archiving, and transmittal. QL-Pay and MLT are applications developed by FLHD and unique to supporting the FLH core business function.

Currently, these programs either produce unformatted ASCII text files, or send formatted report output directly to a printer.

In all these cases, the goal is to construct documents to modern standards of formatting (style – fonts, graphics, etc) in a printer-ready format (file encoding) without targeting a specific printer, without requiring users to purchase third-party products. Users will be able to conveniently view and print such documents, to store them on-line, and transmit the files over the Internet. 

Information on the software being marketed must include:  manufacturer; technical capabilities and documentation that needs to show the software will perform and meet the requirements stated above.   Information material may be sent hardcopy or a website may be referenced for FHWA’s review.  Please respond by either mail, Fax or e-mail.   Hard copy submissions may be mailed to: Federal Highway Administration, ATTN: Toni Palmer, 610 East Fifth Street, Vancouver, WA 98661 or faxed to 360-619-7855, Attn: Toni Palmer.  E-mails may be sent to tmpalmer@mail.wfl.fhwa.dot.gov.  Please reference this sources sought inquiry.  This sources sought synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract nor does the government intend to directly pay for any information or responses submitted as the result of this sources sought synopsis.   The due date and time for responses to this announcement is 4:00 p.m. Pacific Standard Time, March 14, 2005.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST- University Research Infrastructure Enhancements Summary: The Department of Energyâ€™s (DOE) assistance to U.S. universities in the area of nuclear science and technology has had a profound effect on the field of nuclear engineering in the United States.  Specifically, DOE has helped to reverse the decline in the number of nuclear engineering programs and students at U.S. colleges and universities.  In 1998, fewer than 500 students in the United States were enrolled in the field of nuclear engineering, down from 1,500 in 1992.  After several years of focused cooperative programs by DOE and the university community, the U.S. now has again approximately 1500 students studying nuclear engineering.  This number is expected to increase as existing educational support programs are expanded and new programs are started. There are presently 25 universities operating 26 university reactors in 19 states. The primary purpose of university research reactors and related facilities is to educate those interested in working in the nuclear technology industry, nuclear medicine, or fundamental research areas.  The role of university research reactors has evolved from the study of basic reactor physics and nuclear engineering to more diversified applications involving reactor use in basic and applied research as well as technological studies encompassing many disciplines. Unfortunately, most research reactors at U.S. universities date from the 1950s and 1960s and were not designed for these changing requirements. To assist the Department in planning and implementing program activities intended to respond to the Nationâ€™s growing requirements in nuclear technology education and academic research, DOE is requesting input on potential actions that could enhance the university nuclear research infrastructure in this country. Scope of Work: DOE, by this notice, requests expressions of interest from U.S. universities, or consortia of universities and industry in identifying and developing enhancements and upgrades to major components of university nuclear engineering research infrastructure. The Department seeks expressions, which include a scope of work from universities, or consortia of universities and industries for research enhancements at university research facilities.  The enhancements must be located at or near and used by U.S. colleges or universities and may include the deployment of new facilities.  Expressions of interest should describe the design and/or development of major enhancements and/or upgrades and how these upgrades and enhancements would be beneficial in supporting nuclear education. Reactor activities, location, configuration, capabilities and user-base should be included as a part of this description.  These expressions should include an initial estimate of the cost to develop these concepts.  The expressions should also include an indication of private sector funding and commitments that may be available for these enhancements.  In addition, the expressions should describe how the upgrade or enhancement will improve performance, quality, safety, security, or efficiency of the reactor, facility or laboratory. Items typically funded by DOEâ€™s University Reactor Instrumentation (URI) Program, should not be included in the expression of interest. Expression of interest should be received by May 1, 2005. CONTACT INFORMATION: The Department seeks expressions of interest that describe the development, design, modification, and/or construction of major enhancements to the Nationâ€™s university nuclear and technology research infrastructure and how these upgrades will be beneficial in supporting nuclear education and academic research.  The expressions should identify university and partner organizations and provide points of contact.   After the Department receives the expressions of interest, DOE will evaluate the expressions for our use in developing future University Research Infrastructure solicitations. Proprietary information contained within a submission should be identified and marked accordingly.  The Department will protect proprietary information to the extent permitted by law. Interested parties may submit their expressions via email with the subject line, "RESPONSE TO EOI FOR UNIVERSITY RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE ENHANCEMENTS" to Seb Klein (Sebastian.Klein@nuclear.energy.gov) no later than 3:00 p.m. MST on May 1, 2005. Any questions to this EOI should be directed to Mr. Klein (Sebastian.Klein@nuclear.energy.gov) via email. Disclaimer:  The information obtained through this Expression of Interest/Request for Information may be applied in the implementation of the Department's formal acquisition process.  This document, which is intended to elicit information and comments for university reactor enhancements and upgrades, does not represent a commitment by the Government to enter into a financial assistance instrument for the work described herein. Neither is this document intended as a formal solicitation of competitive financial assistance applications.  No costs associated with responding to this Request will be borne by the Government.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement to upgrade an instrumented impact striker and data acquisition system.  The Government will provide a reusable striker.  The instrumented striker is from our Tinius Olsen (TO) Model 84 (264 ft-lbf capacity) impact machine, which should be regaged by the successful bidder and reinstalled on our TO Model 84 for use with this new system. The successful bidder shall take responsibility for the new upgraded system (including the striker).  Prototypes are not acceptable, only proven systems will be considered.  Our request is for the lowest total cost to obtain a complete system that meets the specifications listed below.  NIST plans to use this system to assign values to reference-grade instrumented impact specimens.  Thus, this system must be of very high resolution, and better than the average industrial system. 
1)	Strain Gages - Strain gages to be mounted on the TO 84 striker shall be of the bonded resistance type (semiconductor gages are not acceptable)
2)	Optical Encoder - An optical encoded with at least 20,000 divisions per revolution is required so that a useful estimate of the instantaneous velocity of the striker can be recorded through out the test. 
3)	Amplifier - The amplifier for the strain signals shall have the following minimum specifications:
a.	wideband operation without filtering
b.	DC to 100 kHz or higher full power bandwidth at all gain settings
c.	continuously variable gain of 1 to 3000
4)	Fast Acquisition Board - The fast acquisition board for acquiring the output from the amplifier shall have the following minimum specifications:
a.	20 MHz bandwidth or higher
b.	12 bit or higher resolution
c.	1.25 Megasample/second or higher sampling rate
d.	Capable of acquiring 50,000 points per test or higher
e.	Capable of acquiring at least 1000 points/msec
5)	Data Acquisition Computer - A computer to house the acquisition board and process the data with the following minimum specifications:
a.	Computer with Pentium IV or AMD processor (2.4GHz, 1Gb RAM, or better)
b.	Windows 2000 operating system
c.	Keyboard and mouse (The government will furnish the monitor.) 
6)	Software - The software shall meet the following specifications:
a.	Data acquisition and analysis program with flexible data analysis and plotting capability 
b.	Easily changeable test configurations to accommodate various test requirements, such as both full-size pendulum (TO 84) and table top plastics machine (Tinius Olsen machine for use with ASTM D256)
c.	Virtual digital voltmeter for easy load cell balance verification and shunt calibration check
d.	Ability to store the optical encoder, instrumented striker energy and velocity, percent shear, and lateral expansion in the instrumented data file
e.	ASCII data file storage format for easy transfer to other analysis and presentation programs
f.	User manual and extensive built-in program help
g.	Global unit change capability for easy conversion from English to metric
h.	Ability to create plots and custom tables which summarize results from any number of tests
It is understood that the absorbed energy calculated directly from the instrumented striker data will not be exactly the same as the absorbed energy measured on the dial of the impact machine.  However, the agreement for this system shall be reasonable, and this system shall perform at a level considered as state of the art for instrumented impact machines in 2004 (as reflected by general literature and round robin data).  It is expected that the performance of the system exceeds that required (or expected) by the ASTM work item on instrumented testing, WK383 (Method for Instruments Impact Tests of Metallic Materials).  This proposed standard prescribes the test method for performing instrumented Charpy V-Notch (CVN) impact tests.
***In the future, we plan to use the amplifier, computer, etc. from this system with our Tinius Olsen plastics impact machine.  At that time, we will need an appropriate instrumented striker, which shall be listed as an option on this bid.***
This procurement is being conducted under FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items(NTE 100K) as a combined notice/solicitation.  No separate solicitation is available.  The proposed procurement is non-restrictive, but small businesses will receive preference.  The award decision will be based on price, technical merit and proven performance.  Written proposals should address all of the required specifications and will be accepted until close of business on March 25, 2005.  FAR Clauses in full text are available at http://www.ARNET.gov/far/.  Any contractors doing business with the Government must now be registered with the Central Contractor Registry. The web site is http://www.ccr.gov/. Agency level protest procedures can be found on web site http://oamweb.osec.doc.gov/conops/reflib/alp1296.htm. Any questions regarding this notice must be submitted in writing to the attention of Ms. Rima (e-mail preferred). Anticipated award date is March 31, 2005.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition procedures pursuant to the authority of FAR Subpart 13.5, FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items (Title VIII of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 (Public Law 103-355)), and FAR Subpart 37.4, Non-Personal Health Care Services (10 U.S.C. 2304 and 41 U.S.C. 253.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; therefore, a written solicitation will not be issued. The Billings Area Indian Health Service (IHS) intends to award a firm fixed-price performance based commercial item contract in response to Request for Quotation (RFQ) 10-05-022-BAC to acquire Podiatry Services for the Wind River Service Unit located on the Wind River Indian Reservation, Ft. Washakie, Wyoming.  The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-26. The associated North American Industry Classification System code is 621391 and the small business size standard is $8.5 million. PRICE SCHEDULE:  Offers should be submitted for the BASE YEAR: 48 Clinics @ $________ per Clinic = $__________; OPTION YEAR ONE: 48 Clinics @ $________ per Clinic = $__________; OPTION YEAR TWO: 48 Clinics @ $________ per Clinic = $__________; OPTION YEAR THREE: 48 Clinics @ $________ per Clinic = $__________; OPTION YEAR FOUR: 48 Clinics @ $________ per Clinic = $__________.  Clinics will be scheduled two days per month between the hours of 8:00am and 4:45pm at the Ft. Washakie Health Center and two days per month between the hours of 8:00am and 4:45pm at the Arapahoe Clinic.  The proposal must be inclusive of transportation, food, and lodging.  This procurement is a non-personal health care service contract, as defined in FAR 37.101, under which the Contractor is an independent contractor.  The Government may evaluate the quality of professional and administrative services provided, but retains no control over the medical and professional aspects of services rendered (e.g., professional judgments, diagnosis for specific medical treatment).  The Contractor shall indemnify the Government for any liability producing acts or omissions by the Contractor, its employees and agents occurring during contract performance.  The Contractor shall maintain medical liability insurance, which is not less than the amount normally prevailing within the local community for the medical specialty concerned.  The Contractor is required to ensure that its subcontracts for provisions of health care services contain the requirements of the clause at 52.237-7, including the maintenance of medical liability insurance. MAJOR DUTIES:  Will provide podiatry services in general clinic.  The contractor shall provide on-site services for a podiatry clinic to outpatients scheduled by the Government physicians/ providers at the Wind River Service Unit.  During each clinic the contractor will see up to 15 patients scheduled by the staff of the Fort Washakie Health Center or Arapahoe Health Centers.  The contractor shall take a history and perform an appropriate examination.  The findings shall be correlated with the laboratory and x-ray findings.  The contractor shall make a verbal report to a Government physician and shall further make a written consultation on the patient’s medical chart or in the Electronic Health  Record.  The written consultation shall include the findings, impression, and recommendations about the management.  Any rescheduling of clinic days or times shall involve consultation with the Contractor by the Government, but shall be at the convenience of the Government.  Notification of change must be given at least two (2) weeks prior to the date of change.  The Contractor shall be available for consultation by telephone and shall give recommendations to the Government physicians about management of patients seen between clinics, at no charge to the Government.  The Contractor shall accept transfer for patients to his care at his private office or at a local contact hospital by formal written referral from a Government physician.  In the event that an emergency admission of an eligible person occurs in a local contract hospital, and that the Contractor is responsible for the care of the patient, the preferred procedure is telephone notification and request for the authorization by an IHS physician.  Such a request may be made after the admission by calling the IHS physician on call or the Service Unit Director.   In such an emergency admission, failure to notify the Wind River Service Unit within 72 hours removes the obligation of the Indian Health Service to participate in the responsibility for payment.  While the primary responsibility for notification is with the patient or the patient’s family, notification by the contractor or the hospital may often avert difficulties.  Referral from one hospital to another requires the prior approval by an IHS physician.  Initial oral permission is followed by written authorization by the IHS Physician.  Laboratory and other diagnostic tests including x-ray examinations shall be made in one of the Indian Health Service Centers whenever possible.  The Contractor will order these tests elsewhere when they are not available at the Indian Health Centers or when the patient is an inpatient at another facility under the care of the contractor.  Authorization shall be obtained from the referring IHS physician before tests are scheduled.  It shall be required that the Contractor’s private office and the hospital the Contractor utilizes for inpatient procedures be no farther than 60 minutes driving time from Fort Washakie, Wyoming or Arapahoe, Wyoming under normal driving conditions at posted speed limits in a private vehicle.  Physician fees for inpatients or outpatient office visits at another facility will be paid at Medicare rate or lower.  This contractor will be required to abide by all the rules and regulations that govern the Privacy Act, the Indian Health Service, and the Department of Health and Human Services.  All new employees are required to take HIPAA training within a few days after receiving their award letter, notice-to-proceed, access and annually thereafter.

In the event that an emergency admission of an eligible person occurs in a local contract hospital, and that the Contractor is responsible for the care of the patient, the preferred procedure is telephone notification and request for the authorization by an IHS physician.  Such a request may be made after the admission by calling the IHS physician on call or the Service Unit Director.   In such an emergency admission, failure to notify the Wind River Service Unit within 72 hours removes the obligation of the Indian Health Service to participate in the responsibility for payment.  While the primary responsibility for notification is with the patient or the patient’s family, notification by the contractor or the hospital may often avert difficulties.  Referral from one hospital to another requires the prior approval by an IHS physician.  Initial oral permission is followed by written authorization by the IHS Physician.  Laboratory and other diagnostic tests including x-ray examinations shall be made in one of the Indian Health Service Centers whenever possible.  The Contractor will order these tests elsewhere when they are not available at the Indian Health Centers or when the patient is an inpatient at another facility under the care of the contractor.  Authorization shall be obtained from the referring IHS physician before tests are scheduled.  It shall be required that the Contractor’s private office and the hospital the Contractor utilizes for inpatient procedures be no farther than 60 minutes driving time from Fort Washakie, Wyoming or Arapahoe, Wyoming under normal driving conditions at posted speed limits in a private vehicle.  Physician fees for inpatients or outpatient office visits at another facility will be paid at Medicare rate or lower.

Any rescheduling of clinic days or times shall involve consultation with the Contractor by the Government, but shall be at the convenience of the Government.  Notification of change must be given at least two (2) weeks prior to the date of change.  The Contractor shall be available for consultation by telephone and shall give recommendations to the Government physicians about management of patients seen between clinics, at no charge to the Government.  The Contractor shall accept transfer for patients to his care at his private office or at a local contact hospital by formal written referral from a Government physician.  In the event that an emergency admission of an eligible person occurs in a local contract hospital, and that the Contractor is responsible for the care of the patient, the preferred procedure is telephone notification and request for the authorization by an IHS physician.  Such a request may be made after the admission by calling the IHS physician on call or the Service Unit Director.   In such an emergency admission, failure to notify the Wind River Service Unit within 72 hours removes the obligation of the Indian Health Service to participate in the responsibility for payment.  While the primary responsibility for notification is with the patient or the patient’s family, notification by the contractor or the hospital may often avert difficulties.  Referral from one hospital to another requires the prior approval by an IHS physician.  Initial oral permission is followed by written authorization by the IHS Physician.  Laboratory and other diagnostic tests including x-ray examinations shall be made in one of the Indian Health Service Centers whenever possible.  The Contractor will order these tests elsewhere when they are not available at the Indian Health Centers or when the patient is an inpatient at another facility under the care of the contractor.  Authorization shall be obtained from the referring IHS physician before tests are scheduled.  It shall be required that the Contractor’s private office and the hospital the Contractor utilizes for inpatient procedures be no farther than 60 minutes driving time from Fort Washakie, Wyoming or Arapahoe, Wyoming under normal driving conditions at posted speed limits in a private vehicle.  Physician fees for inpatients or outpatient office visits at another facility will be paid at Medicare rate or lower.  
The contractor will be required to abide by all the rules and regulations that govern the Privacy Act, the Indian Health Service, and the Department of Health and Human Services.  All new employees are required to take HIPAA training within a few days after receiving their award letter, notice-to-proceed, access and annually thereafter.

Description

The Gas Metrology Team of the Analytical Chemistry Division requires a balance with the weighing chamber enclosed in a thermally controlled environment, which can be swept with a controlled flow of gas at a pressure up to 1 bar.  The weighing load is intended to be a permeation tube whose mass will be measured over long time periods.  As such the load shall be capable of being detached from the balance automatically, without opening the weighing chamber, such that the balance zero may be read or zeroed.  The weighing chamber shall be made of Pyrex glass, and allow the flow of temperature controlled water (from an add-on unit) around the glass to control the weighing environments temperature.  The balance mechanics shall be isolated from contamination from the gas in the weighing chamber, as it may be corrosive.  

The balance shall meet the following minimum specifications:

Measuring Load: 	 	0 to 20 g
Resolution:		1 microgram 
Reproducibility:		Plus/Minus 3 microgram
Uncertainty:		Less than 0.002 percent rdg.

This Center is located in a leased private facility in Boyers, Pennsylvania.  Timely, sanitary refuse removal services are required to keep the facility refuse free.  OPM requires timely dependable refuse removal services on a set daily schedule, with the flexibility to change or order additional deliverables (refuse pickup) based on the amount of the facility’s generated trash (refuse).  Timeliness and quality of the deliverables (refuse pickup) is a major priority as is the service providers’ ability to meet and comply with all Federal, State, and Local regulatory measures and licenses.  DEFINITIONS: Refuse:  Miscellaneous trash, rubbish, and garbage shall be defined as, combustible and non-combustible materials; paper, corrugated boxes, lumber, plastic, filled garbage bags, wasted food products, etc. Collection:  The times when the contractor shall empty the containers/dumpsters. Containers: Front loading type dumpsters. The contractor will provide containers and daily refuse collection services for the CFIS operation located within Government leased space.  Collection occurs at a pre-designated outdoors area that is maneuverable for frontload refuse collection trucks.  The contractor shall supply five, 8 cubic yard containers for storing the refuse until collection.  Collection shall occur three days weekly, Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, between the hours of 9:00 AM and 11:30 AM or 12:30 PM and 2:00 PM.  Government holidays shall be excluded from the scheduled collection times.  OPM requires the flexibility to alter collection times and/or number of containers for this service.  The Contracting Officer (CO) or his/her designated Representative shall be responsible for the providing 24 hour notice should changes to the collection times or changes in the number of containers be required.  Furthermore, the CO shall be the only Government official able to modify the terms and conditions for this requirement.  Contacts: The contractor must establish a contact person with the CO and designated COR at the service location.  They will serve as the main points of contact during unexpected circumstances such as an unanticipated federal holiday, inclement weather, etc.  Contractor Driver Responsibilities: The driver shall be responsible for loading, and transporting of the generated refuse from the pre-determined site location.  As part of each pick-up, the driver shall ensure the container holding area at the pre-determined site is free of refuse before departing the site.  Furthermore, it shall be the drivers’ responsibility to ensure the containers are placed in the container holding area in an organized fashion that provides the best access for facility personnel to empty generated trash into the containers.  Offerors are invited to submit firm, fixed price quotation responses for deliverables.  Deliverable 1 = monthly rental cost of each container; deliverable 2 = Cost per trip for refuse removal service.  Any and all additional costs (such as tipping fees, fuel/environmental charges, etc.) shall be absorbed by the offeror and shall not be included as a separate line item.  The governments’ requirement will be for a base period of six months, with an option period of one additional year.

<DESC>AMENDMENT 001:  The purpose of this amendment is to answer vendor questions.  The date for receipt of quotes is NOT extended.  

QUESTION 1. Is it necessary for the training to be conducted outside of Fort Bragg, or could we use Fort Bragg as the training Facility?  ANSWER 1. There are no suitable and available facilities on Fort Bragg to conduct this training.  

QUESTION 2. Questions were asked regarding student-instructor ratios.  ANSWER 2. Technical approaches to meeting the training requirements, to include  student-instructor ratio will be evaluated and considered in the best value determination. 

QUESTION 3. Various questions were asked about quotes being accepted for alternate locations (terrain) to conduct the training.  ANSWER 3. The requested terrain is believed to be an important factor in achieving realistic training.  As such, it is a key requirement.  However, quotes indicating alternate locations capable of meeting the training requirements will be accepted and evaluated.  A complete description of all proposed locations shall be included in the quote.  

QUESTION 4. Various questions were asked about an incumbent contractor.  ANSWER 4. There is no incumbent currently conducting this training.  

QUESTION 5. What length runway does a C-17 require?  ANSWER 5. The runway/airport location is required for quoted training locations that the Government would have to fly to.  Our research shows that a C-17 requires a 5,000 to 7,000 foot runway.  Although the Government will be responsible for flight arrangements, it is advisable that vendors contact their local airport to verify that a C-17 can utilize their airfield. 

QUESTION 6. What type of GPS units do the operators use?  Is it Garmin?  ANSWER 6. Yes, they will use the Garmin GPS system. 

QUESTION 7. Are the HMMWV's fully armoured?  ANSWER 7. The M1113 GMV-S Desert Variant will be used.  These vehicles are not fully armoured.

This modification is a combined synopsis/solicitation for comme rcial items prepared in accordance with format in subpart 12.2, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice; a written solicitation will not be issued.  Additional information such as specification and drawing can be accessed at htt p://doc.campbell.army.mil.   The following are questions/answers pertaining to this solicitation:  a). Question:  We have some modular buildings available that were constructed for the military and used for only one year; are buildings acceptable?  Answer:   No.  b).  Question:  In which offices do you want 28 oz carpet.  Answer:  All offices must receive carpet.  c)  Question:  Do you want 1/8 or 1/5 tile?  Answer:  1/8 tile.  d)  Question.  Do you want base cabinets only at the coffee bar? Answer:  Yes.   e) Question:  It is difficult to count the windows on the plans; are there 8 in the single wide and 12 in the large building? Answer:  Yes.  f) Question:  Do you want blank j boxes for data/phone wiring? If so, how many?  Answer:  No, wire completely, qu ad drops (with 2 data and 2 voice every six feet) on the wall of Trailer A & B.  For Trailer C, quad drops are required as well as dual drops every six feet (dual per station) home run in conduit.  g) Question:  Support posts will be required at the mateli nes in the large roomsis that going to be a problem?

I) Question:  The bid states that there a re a total of three buildings each measuring 14x70 feet (two of the to be seamed together); however the diagrams provided show a total of 5 buildings. Two are labeled in building 'A' for pilots, Two are labeled 'B' for crew members; and finally the single labeled 'C' for Command Group. I imagine that 'C' will stay as the single however which of the two double wides are we bidding on trailer 'A' or 'B'.  Answer:  There are modular buildings that are double wides and one set that is single wide.  J) Question:   Assuming that it is three units that would make a total of 4 exterior doors and you require  3 sets of wood steps with 5x5 landing and handrails and 3 sets of Handicapped ramps; I just wanted to clarify if we are only doing three buildings what is the st ep requirement.  Answer:  No, that would be 6 exterior doors requiring 3 sets of steps and 3 sets of handicap ramps.  We dont need steps on the ramp entrances.  K) Question:  You also ask for 3 sets of poured footers; did you mean the required amount of f ooters for each building?  Answer:  Yes, footers for each modular building.  L)  Question:  Is that for the foundation on the building our for the decks with canopy and ramps only?  Answer:  This is for the footers on the buildings, decks, and ramps.  M) Question:  Whos responsible for the Decks, ramps and stairs, Below grade piers, and canopies.  Answer:  The contractor.
