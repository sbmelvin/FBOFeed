FOB ORIGIN. The Government does not own the data or the rights to the data
needed to purchase this part from additional sources. It has been determined to
be uneconomical to buy the data or rights to the data. It is uneconomical to
reverse engineer the part. Interested parties may obtain copies of Military and
Federal Specifications and Standards, Qualified Products Lists (QPLs), Qualified
Product Databases (QPDs), Military Handbooks, and other standardized documents
from the DoD Single Stock Point (DODSSP) at Document Automation and Production
Service (DAPS) in Philadelphia, PA. NOTE: Patterns, Drawings, Deviation Lists,
Purchase Descriptions, etc. are NOT stocked at DODSSP. Most documents are

supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate
with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. All responsible sources

(BOA) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the
Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed
contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of
the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the

FOB ORIGIN. The design of this part is unstable. Engineering, manufacturing, or
performance characteristics indicate that the required design objectives have
not been achieved. Major changes are contemplated because the part has a low
process yield or has demonstrated marginal performance during tests or service
use. These changes will render the present part obsolete and unusable in its
present configuration. Limited acquisition from the present source is
anticipated pending configuration changes. Interested parties may obtain copies

<DESC>FMCS has a requirement to procure VOIP services for the agency headquarters and our regional offices. This requirement includes handsets/telephones that have standard communications and internet capabilities. The services are for 300 users, and involves commercially available VOIP services and hardware. The program manager conducted market reseach to determine what vendors exist in the VOIP community that could meet FMCS communications requirement. Based on the results of that market research, the contracting officer determined that it was in the Government's best interest to limit competition to six VOIP vendors as allowed by Simplified&nbsp;Acquisition Procedures (SAP). These vendors will be notified by email. Other vendors may submit a proposal for this solicitation; however, the contracting officer reserves the right to accept or reject that proposal in the best interest of Government under SAP procedures. A Fixed Price Purchase Order for a base year and 3-1 year options will be awarded on January 11, 2016. Responses are due not later than 3:00 PM on December 30, 2015.

This combined synopsis/solicitation SHALL be posted on both FEDBIZOPPS and NECO (https://www.neco.navy.mil/).  

The Solicitation number, N00189-16-T-Z070 is being used as a RFQ.  This solicitation documents and incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through FAC 2005-85 and DFARS Publication Notice 20151130  It is the responsibility of the contractor to be familiar with the applicable clauses and provisions.
  The clauses may be accessed in full text at these addresses: https://www.acquisition.gov/far/    and http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/dars/dfarspgi/current/index.html. The NAICS code is 611430 and the Small Business Standard is $11M. The Small Business Office concurs with the set-aside decision: Other than Full and Open Competition.

The NAVSUP FLC Norfolk Philadelphia Office intends to issue a sole source firm fixed price purchase order for the acquisition of this requirement.

The proposed contract action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.501.

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed procurement action based upon responses received is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government will not pay for information submitted in response to this notice.

 This acquisition will be sole sourced to World Institute of Leadership and Learning, Ltd. (dba. WILL Interactive)  10000 Falls Road, Ste. 305  Potomac, MD. 20854.
