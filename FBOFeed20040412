<DESC>Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) TCBAA-03-000R Development of Electrical Wiring Interconnect System Test and Inspection Systems 1. Background The continued safe operation of aircraft well into their expected service life depends on the safe and effective transfer of power and electrical signals throughout the aircraft electrical wiring interconnect system (EWIS).  This in turn requires the verification and monitoring of the EWIS physical and functional integrity.  In the event that the EWIS is treated as an indefinite life item, formal periodic inspections will be necessary to ensure its continued safe operation.  Whether the EWIS is eventually subject to a fixed service life, condition based monitoring, or other life management program, there will still be a need for periodic inspection to: 1) ensure the absence of accidental damage; 2) verify service life estimates; and, 3) confirm the adequacy of maintenance and repair activities on, around, and involving the EWIS. 2. Purpose The purpose of this BAA is to support development of testing, monitoring and inspection systems, technology, and techniques that identify or characterize the material or structural flaws which may impair the safe and effective transmission of electrical power and signals.  The proposed systems, technology, and techniques shall exhibit potential utility for either infrequent comprehensive examinations or frequent focused inspections in an airline maintenance environment. Non-destructive inspection technologies are required to: ÔÅ±	Ensure the absence of accidental damage and/or EWIS degradation due to aging and operations. ÔÅ±	Verify service life estimates. ÔÅ±	Confirm the adequacy of maintenance and repair activities on, around, and involving the EWIS. ÔÅ±	Locate and characterize EWIS damage due to aging and operation. ÔÅ±	Locate and characterize precursors to EWIS failure due to aging and operation. ÔÅ±	Determine location of arc faults when troubleshooting an arc fault condition. ÔÅ±	Determine location of open and shorted faults in the EWIS. 3. Submission Deadlines Technical summary proposals (see section 4) prepared in accordance with this synopsis will be accepted through 30 June 2004 or until fiscal year 2004 funding for this effort is committed, whichever occurs first.  Upon request of the FAA, formal technical proposals shall be submitted not more than thirty days after the date of the request.  This request will be made via email and letter. 4. Submission Requirements Offerors will submit two-page technical summaries prior to submitting a formal proposal.  The two page technical summary shall meet the requirements described below.  Mail the two page technical summaries to: William J. Hughes Technical Center Code AAR-480 (Attn: R. Pappas) Atlantic City Int‚Äôl Airport, NJ 08405 In addition (not as a substitute for the paper copy), an electronic version of the summary proposal will be emailed to Michael.Walz@FAA.gov rob.pappas@faa.gov.  The electronic version shall be provided in Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat format. Thirty days after receipt of the two-page technical summaries, the FAA will respond to offerors in one of three ways: a.	Request for the submission a formal technical proposal. b.	Recommendation to submit a formal technical proposal if certain changes are made or conditions met. c.	Rejection of the summary proposal. If requested, the offeror shall submit a formal technical proposal, containing a detailed discussion of the item presented in the two-page technical summary.  The formal technical proposal shall address the requirements described in the ‚ÄòFormal Proposal Requirements‚Äô section of this announcement.  The formal technical proposal will be mailed to the FAA at the same address as the summary proposal.  An electronic copy must also be provided. 5. Two-Page Technical Summary Requirements There is no specific format for the two page technical summary.  The summary may be preceded by a cover letter, but the cover letter will not be considered in the evaluation, nor will pages in excess of two.  At a minimum the summary shall contain the following items: a.	The specific purpose of the system, technology, or technique. b.	 Full Description of the system, including technology, or technique how the information will be conveyed to the operator. c.	Description of the class of applications for which the device is useful. d.	Description of how the device will be useful to the aviation community. e.	Information regarding interest or endorsements of aviation concerns. f.	Current state of development of the system, technology, or technique. g.	Estimated time for development, test, and validation, of a commercial prototype. h.	Estimated funds required for the proposed effort, including in-house funds. 6. Formal Proposal Requirements  a.	Offerors shall specify the development of a device with performance and cost specifications matching the requirements of some application or class of applications of interest to some segment of the aviation community.  The device may measure:  1.	Physical properties of the EWIS (elastic modulus, hardness, etc.);  2.	Material and structural anomalies (cuts, abrasions, chemical properties, etc.);  3.	Local electrical properties of the EWIS (dielectric constants, resistance, etc.);  4.	Bulk electrical properties of the EWIS (resistance, impedance, capacitance, isolation, AC&DC voltage drop, polarization ratio, dissipation factor, etc.); or, 5.	Any other relevant EWIS properties (thermal excursions under load, electromagnetic fields, etc.). b.	Offerors will identify a partner within the aviation community (i.e. an airframer or aircraft operator) who will serve as an advisor and advocate for the effort.  Proof of commitment by the partner will be provided with the proposal (The proof need not be a contract).  Matching funds or services-in-kind from the partner are not required but will be considered positively during proposal evaluation. c.	If the proposal includes means for test and inspection of aircraft wiring, offerors will select Polyimide, and one or more wire types from the list below that are inspectable by the proposed device.  These selections will be used to independently validate the performance of the device.  1.	PVC/Glass/Nylon (MIL-W-5086, QUAD 4, etc.). 2.	Cross Linked ETFE (MIL-W-22759, Tefzel, Spec 55, etc). 3.	Poly-X (alkane-imide). 4.	Composite construction involving Polyimide or Teflon (TKT, etc). d.	Using empirical evidence and sound logic, offerors will present a persuasive argument that the properties, states, and/or conditions (aging and non-aging conditions) measured by the device correlate with EWIS failure modes that threaten the safety of the aircraft.  The offerer‚Äôs proposal shall contain specific and detailed performance specifications for the proposed system. e.	Offerors shall propose to build a prototype device with the specifications identified above.  For the purposes of preparing the proposal and cost estimate, the prototype shall become the property of the FAA at the conclusion of the program. f.	Offerors shall propose to the FAA a validation plan, which includes double blind testing.  Validation will be performed on the Standard Wiring Testbed located at Sandia National Labs, Albuquerque, NM.  Contact Mr. Mike Dinallo, 505-844-0796, for more information on the testbed.  If the testbed is not suitable to the validation of the proposed technology, please address the rational for this conclusion and an alternative means for validation.  The proposal will address all costs related to the validation effort.  Use of the Standard Wiring Testbed is free of charge. g.	Offerors shall prepare an implementation and technology transfer plan, describing how the proposed technology will developed into commercial products practical for use in the inspection and maintenance of older aircraft.  h.	The proposal shall identify all areas risk related to development, implementation, and technology transfer, of the proposed system, technology, or technique.  The proposal shall include mitigating strategies for each risk area.  Proposals that do not identify risk areas will be considered non-developmental in nature and therefore outside the scope of this research program.  Implementation risks are associated with logistical issues, missing/inadequate support infrastructure, etc. i.	Offerors shall include in their proposals a detailed cost proposal.  In-house funding, cost matching, services-in-kind, will be identified in the cost proposal as necessary.  All manpower related to double blind testing and validation shall also be provided.  The cost of the delivered prototype shall be identified separately. 7. Method of Evaluation  Proposals will be evaluated in the seven technical areas listed in order of decreasing importance: a.	Technical merit. b.	Utility to the aviation community. c.	Investigative team competency and experience. d.	Logical and effective validation strategy. e.	Technical risks and implementation risks, and the mitigation plan for each. f.	Availability and quality of equipment and facilities. g.	Effective project management plan. Cost and cost realism will be evaluated as acceptable or unacceptable only.  Acceptable proposals will have costs commensurate with the work load proposed and will not be in excess of $400,000 in any fiscal year.   8. Period of Performance:  Efforts lasting between one and four years will be considered.  Multiyear efforts will be funded in yearly increments, providing measurable and adequate performance is shown prior to each new funding increment.

<SUBJECT>A -- Wide Band Gap Semiconductors for RF Applications (WBGS-RF)
<SOLNBR>BAA04-19
<RESPDATE>072704
<ARCHDATE>04122005
<CONTACT>Mark  Rosker, MTO Program Manager, Phone 571-218-4507, Fax 705 696-2208, Email mrosker@darpa.mil
<DESC>DARPA is soliciting innovative research proposals for the development of wide bandgap semiconductor (WBGS) technology for RF applications. Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, devices, or systems. Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvements to the existing state of practice. The overall objective of this effort is to exploit the properties of wide band gap semiconductors to enhance the capabilities of microwave and millimeter-wave monolithic integrated circuits (MMICs) and, in turn, enable future RF sensor, communication, and multifunction military capabilities. Successful approaches will lead to affordable, high performance, wide band gap devices and MMICs with performance and reliability characteristics consistent with DoD system requirements. 

Phase I of the WBGS RF program focused upon the demonstration of innovative processes for fabricating several types of wide bandgap semiconductor materials including silicon carbide (SiC), gallium nitride (GaN), and nitride-based alloys such as indium aluminum gallium nitride (InAlGaN). This BAA solicits research proposals for Phase II: Device Technologies and Phase III: Circuit Technologies. These Phases will exploit the advances made in material related capabilities during Phase I. Each Phase will be of 24 months duration (a total of 48 months).

Demonstrations that will validate that these objectives have been achieved will be a key aspect of the program. The program will consist of the following distinct Objective Demonstration Tracks:
Track 1:	X-band Transmit and Receive (T/R) Module
Track 2:	Q-band High Power Amplifier Module
Track 3:	Wideband High Power Amplifier Module
Additional information on these Objective Demonstration Tracks and their final Objective Demonstrations is provided in the BAA 04-19 Proposer Information Pamphlet referenced below.

DARPA seeks innovative proposals in the following areas:

I. WBG Materials Optimization: The objective of this task is to demonstrate the requisite improvements in the characteristics of WBG substrate and epitaxial materials and processes to enable the realization of high yields of high performance, reliable WBG devices that can be produced at an affordable cost. 

II. WBG Device Fabrication and Modeling: The objective of this task is to demonstrate WBG device structures with performance characteristics that consistently, repeatedly, and reliably exceed existing capabilities and which subsequently can be incorporated into high performance WBG microwave and/or millimeter-wave monolithic integrated circuits for use in achieving the goals of at least one Objective Demonstration Track. 

III. High Yield, Robust WBG MMICs: The objective of this task is to demonstrate and implement the capability to produce high performance, high reliability WBG MMICs at high yields and an affordable cost. The specific MMIC(s) developed should be targeted for use in meeting the requirements of an Objective Demonstration Track.

IV. Packaging and Thermal Management: The objective of this task is to develop and implement affordable packages/enclosures for WBG MMICs or combinations of MMICs. Activities should lead to designs and hardware that result in the ability of WBG MMICs to achieve their full performance, reliability, and environmental capabilities, minimize labor intensive assembly operations, and which are suitable for production at high rates. 

For each Track, a Proposer is strongly encouraged to address all of the Technical Areas of Interest. To best achieve this, offerors are also strongly encouraged to form teams with the requisite skills and capabilities.

Additional information on these technology areas is provided in the Areas of Interest section of the BAA 04-19 Proposer Information Pamphlet referenced below.

PROGRAM SCOPE

Awards totaling approximately $75 to $110 million over four years are expected to be made during the first half of calendar year 2005.  Multiple awards are anticipated.  Collaborative efforts/teaming are encouraged.  A web site has been established -- http://teams.davincinetbook.com/ -- to facilitate formation of teaming arrangements between interested parties.  Specific content, communications, networking, and team formation are the sole responsibility of the participants.  Neither DARPA nor the Department of Defense (DoD) endorses the destination web site or the information and organizations contained therein, nor does DARPA or the DoD exercise any responsibility at the destination.  This web site is provided consistent with the stated purpose of this BAA. Cost sharing is not required and is not an evaluation criterion but is encouraged where there is a reasonable probability of a potential commercial application related to the proposed research and development effort.  The technical POC for this effort is Mark Rosker, fax:  (703) 696-2206, electronic mail: mrosker@darpa.mil.

<DESC>Description:  SUBJECT: Reactivated, Regenerative Compressed Air Dryers. DESC: The U.S. Department of Energy?s National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Pittsburgh, PA intends to award a purchase order on a sole-source basis to Rogers Machinery Company, Inc., Portland, OR for the purchase of the following items:  (1)  Zeks Genesis, Model 500HB, heat reactivated, regenerative compressed air dryer ? 2 each;  (2)  Finite Model HN8L-6CUG coalescing filter ? 2 each;  (3)  Posi-Drain Model DV720-66 timed, automatic electric drain ? 2 each;  (4)  Finite Model HN6S-3PUG particulate filter assembly ? 2 each;  (5)  Vertical 500 gallon air receiver with safety relief valve-model 95404; pressure gauge ? 0-200 PSIG and 4? face; Manual ball drain; Y strainer for drain; and Posi-Drain Model PD7020 timed automatic, electric drain ? 2 each.  The above equipment will be used to dry the entire Center?s air supply.  The dryers will be located in Building 23 and in Building 34, U.S. Department of Energy, Albany Research Center, Albany, OR.  This system will help the Center meet one of its identified significant aspects for the Center?s ISO 14001 Certification scheduled for completion by the end of VY 2005. Eliminating moisture in the Center air supply will increase the efficiency in the bag houses and eliminate plugging in the Center?s bag houses.  Because a dry air supply is critical to a number of systems on Center, down time during a large scale test must be kept to a minimum.  It is necessary that any supplier be able to guarantee a two hour service response or less time. This purchase order is being issued to Rogers Machinery Company, Inc because in order to standardize these systems for ease of maintenance, minimization of spares, and to drastically reduce the learning curve for successful operation; it is necessary to use the same vendor or Center?s air compressing equipment, Rogers Machinery Company, Inc.   Rogers Machinery Company, Inc is the only vendor available with the specific equipment that will allow for the integration of this apparatus into the Center?s entire compressor maintenance system.  The creation of this maintenance system is essential to meeting the deadlines imposed upon the Center in order to be certified as ISO 14001 compliant by the end of CY 2005.  In addition, this new system will help the Center to meet goals on two of the significant aspects identified by the Center?s Management Team ? the reduction of energy use and the reduction of wastes.  This system is now utilized on a very frequent basis by two major cooperative projects, one of which has extremely tight deadlines and involves the alloying of more than $300,000 worth of platinum during the melting process.  Cooperators travel from San Diego whenever these melts are made to verify the actual use of the platinum.  The cooperator on this project is the number one industrial cooperator in ARC history.  A breakdown in the air pollution control system for primary melter, the vacuum induction furnace, is unacceptable.  Rogers Machinery Company, Inc has a guaranteed 2 hour response service guarantee that is critical to enduring that initial alloying is done in an acceptable time frame. This request is considered to be sole source to Rogers Machinery Company, Inc.  All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by this agency.  Offerors shall provide sufficient technical literature, documents, etc., in order for the Government evaluation team to make an adequate technical assessment of the quote as meeting technical acceptability.  Therefore, no solicitation will result the announcement.  This award shall be made using FAR 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  Request for information should be addressed to Mr. Robert L. Mohn, FAX 412-386-5770.  The Technical Representative for the above requirement is Mr. Paul Turner, 541-967-5863.  All bids, proposals, or quotations must be submitted by 5:00 PM Eastern Time, April 26, 2004.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City, FL (NSWC-PC) intends to award a sole source indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract for, technology assessment, program management and engineering services support for Increment 1 development of the Deployable Joint Command and Control (DJC2) system to Concurrent Technologies Corporation (CTC), an independent non-profit organization, of Johnstown, PA. The period of performance will be for two years. The proposed contract will provide for both term form and completion form delivery orders and will contain Organizational Conflict of Interest provisions that prohibit the contractor from participating in production of the DJC2 Increment 2 and beyond systems. This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. CTC, as an independent non-profit corporation, has established itself as DODís indepe ndent third-party technology verification center. This unique competence has been used on numerous occasions by the DOD to ensure accurate and independently verified decisions are being made to transfer the optimum technology to DOD installations.  This competence has also been used to certify the performance of materials and equipment for addition to the DOD buyers list.  Additionally, CTC has been intimately involved in the design, development and deployment of the DJC2 prototype.  The DJC2 delivery schedule is compressed and critical.  It is imperative that CTCís experience with the DJC2 prototype be leveraged to prevent program duplication and unacceptable delay.   Additionally,  CTC operates four major Defense Centers of Excellence:  the National Center for Excellence in Metalworking Technology (NCEMT); the National Defense Center for Environmental Excellence (NDCEE); the  National Applied Software Engineering Center (NASEC); and the Systems Of Systems Engineering Center of Excellence (SoSECE).  These centers maintain essential capabilities in materials and processing, environmental engineering, electronic commerce, information management, software engineering, Systems of Systems Engineering, laboratory operations and techniques, and structured training for technicians, professionals, and others. This provides DJC2 with access to capabilities directly applicable to technology transition.  CTC provides a means for applying critical advanced environmental, manufacturing, information, and software technologies to the solution of technical problems that directly face DJC2 during Increment 1. CTC has developed state-of-the-art technology and services in virtual reality, 3-D scientific visualization and collaborative engineering to provide cost-effecti ve solutions that support the decision-making process that are of direct interest to the DJC2 development phase. These technological services have been applied to a variety of domains including battlefield visualization and simulations, process and product design, real-time network monitoring, mission familiarization and architectural design.  NAICS Code is 541330.  Contract Specialist: John Miller, Code XPS1, NSWC-PC, 110 Vernon Ave, Panama City, Fl 32407-7001 (904) 235-5399, FAX (904) 234-4251.   Note 22 Applies.

<DESC>Reference is made to TDA 0330008B.  POC Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009.  Email: ekunene@tda.gov.  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT THE CONTRACTS OFFICE.  PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE:  Project Management; USTDA Study on Port of Tanjung Priok IT Integration and Telecommunications Project; C/o Deputy Director for Development of Sea Transport Information System; Mr. Adolf R. Tambunan; Directorate General of Sea Communication; Karya Building, 14th Floor; Jl. Medan Merdeka Barat No. 8; Jakarta 10110; Indonesia; Phone/Fax: (62-21) 350-7002/350-7045; Email arichard@link.net.id. The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide technical assistance for an Information Technology Integration and Telecommunications project at the Port of Tanjung Priok, in Indonesia.

The port of Tanjung Priok in Jakarta exports and imports the largest volume of bulk and container cargo of any port in Indonesia.  It is by far the largest single port of origin for Indonesian exports to the United States and is a key port of origin within the member economies of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) group.  Tanjung Priokís sheer size and importance in regional and global trade require for it to have a well-organized management structure that can help to guarantee port security and efficiency.  Access to the portís assets and adjoining areas also requires strict oversight.  Currently, there is an intricate matrix of government agencies that are responsible for administration, traffic control, security, emergency response and customs regulation.  It is therefore of priority to seek improvement on the portís various IT systems to communicate centrally or with each other to maximize efficiency and further improve the portís ability to maintain a safe and secure environment for export and import traffic.

With respect to the telecommunications system development, the Terms of Reference (TOR) for this technical assistance include: telecommunications system review, including existing infrastructure design, distribution grid and connectivity baselines; analysis of port-agency telecommunications security functions; auditing of system functionality and emergency scenarios; development of business process requirements and gap analysis; preparation of telecommunications grid remediation report; and presentation of full system architecture.

With respect to the integrated IT system development, the TOR include: analysis of port business processes; review of existing IT software and hardware baselines; analysis of the vulnerabilities of infrastructure, port business processes and current IT systems; recommendations for process re-engineering, functionality and connectivity; development of systems, equipment and training cost estimates; development of a training plan; and ascertaining port management choices among potential U.S. sources of supply; and 
preparation of a development strategy plan and financing options.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $555,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firmís name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00PM, May 7, 2004 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>DESC: The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), in conjunction with the United States Air Force, plans to offer the privatization of the electric, natural gas, and water distribution systems, and wastewater collection system at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements. As a result of this solicitation, the firm will be selected to assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility system(s). The successful firm will be required to provide expansions to the system(s) to meet future needs of the government. The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility system(s). The Contractor(s) shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system(s) to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area. The Contractor(s) shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility system(s) in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract. Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of a Right-of-Way (ROW) as an attachment to the RFP. The utility system(s) will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract. The Contractor(s) proposals and plans may become a part of the contract upon the decision to award.  Past performance information from potential Offerors shall be submitted as directed in the RFP. No Offeror will be denied the opportunity to submit a proposal in response to the RFP.

Wright-Patterson AFB, located 10 miles eastñnortheast of Dayton in Greene County, Ohio, is headquarters for the Air Force Material Command (AFMC).  The mission of the AFMC is to research, develop, test, deliver, and logistically support every Air Force weapon system.  Wright-Patterson AFB occupies 8,145 acres with approximately 1,600 facilities on base plus 2,354 units of family housing.

Electrical: Dayton Power and Light (DP&L) provides power to Wright-Patterson via a 69kV line.  A secondary emergency delivery point is limited to 30 MVA.  The on-base distribution system was installed in the late 1950s.  The 69-kV transmission system delivers power to nine substations consisting of 69-kV circuit breakers, transformers, and secondary switchgear.  The overhead and underground distribution systems are in good condition, and the overhead system has generous excess capacity.

Natural Gas:  Gas is supplied to the base by DP&L at 11 metering stations at a maximum pressure of 45 psig.  The on-base distribution system consists of approximately 131,000 linear feet of underground piping with numerous service regulators reducing line pressure at each building.  The piping consists of approximately 68% polypropylene, 28% steel, and 2% cast iron.  The entire distribution system has a weighted average age of 20 years.  Wright-Patterson currently uses approximately 20% of the total system capacity.

Potable Water: Water is obtained entirely from wells drilled into the aquifer underlying the base.  The base is divided into three areas with each area having separate well, treatment facilities, and distribution systems.  Volatile organic chemical (VOC) contamination has been detected in almost all of the drinking water wells; the treatment process, therefore, includes VOC removal (through air stripping units), scaling control, chlorination, and for housing areas, fluoridation.  Potable water is stored in both ground level and elevated reservoirs in each area of the base; each area has electric pumps to transfer water to elevated storage, as well as diesel pumps for emergency purposes.  Excess capacity exists in all areas, with areas A, B, and C having excess capacities of 3.6 mgpd, 2.28 mgpd, and 7.7 mgpd respectfully.

Sanitary Wastewater: The wastewater collection system centralizes all waste at one point, where it is pumped by a non-base pumping station via a 20-inch main to its ultimate discharge into the City of Dayton collection system.  The collection system consists of approximately 70% vitreous clay pipe and 30% sewer drainpipe; the average age of the collection system is 35 years.  Approximately 0.8 mgpd excess capacity exists in this system.

This requirement is unrestricted.  All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered. Large businesses are required to submit a subcontracting plan with their offer. Interested sources should contact Mily Le at mily.le@dla.mil to be added to our bidder mailing list.  A copy of the solicitation will be available after issuance, on the Internet at the below listed URL. The solicitation will be available on or after April 27, 2004.

Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The U.S. Army REDCOM - Natick Contracting, in support of the US Army Soldier Systems Center-Natick has a requirement for a new Advanced Combat Helmet (ACH) which will  replace the helmet known as the √¢¬Ä¬úPersonnel Armor System Ground Troops√¢¬Ä¬ù ( PASGT). The ACH will provide an improved helmet to Soldiers that in addition to providing the Soldier ballistic and impact protection, will be used as a  platform to mount electronics such as communication devices, and Night Vision devices among other item s.  As a helmet it will provide standard √¢¬Ä¬úHelmet, Ground Troops and Parachutists√¢¬Ä¬ù and (PASGT) protection as well as increased 9mm protection. The reduced edge cut of the ACH, although reducing area of coverage, will improve the field of vision an d hearing, leading to better situational awareness over the current helmet. The ACH has five basic components: The helmet shell, the pad suspension system, the retention system (chinstrap/napestrap) helmet cover and eye strap.  The performance specificatio n for the helmet, (shell, pad suspension system, and retention system) can be found under Sources Sought in Fedbizopps.   The Government anticipates that this requirement will be a Full and Open Competitive acquisition, however, the Government reserves the  right to change the solicitation procedure.

The Government anticipates a one-year Base Ordering Period, with four, one -year Options. If one contract is awarded, the anticipated minimum requirement is 50,000 ACHs and a maximum requirement of 200,000 ACHs and applicable spare parts for the base ordering period;  for the first option period the anticipated minimum requiremen t is 50,000 ACHs and a maximum requirement of 300,000 ACHs and applicable spare parts; for the second option period the anticipated minimum requirement is 50,000 ACHs and a maximum requirement of 300,000 ACHs and applicable spare parts; for the third optio n period the anticipated minimum requirement is a 1 ACH  and a maximum requirement of 80,000 ACHs and applicable spares; for the fourth option period the anticipated minimum requirement is a 1 ACH  and a maximum requirement of 80,000 ACHs and applicable sp ares.  If more than one contract is awarded the requirements will be divided equally to the winning offerors.

<DESC>Contractor shall furnish all labor, equipment, materials, transportation and supervision necessary to accomplish design-build renovations to Buildging 5165 at Fort Dix, New Jersey.  This project is a best value, two phase design-build solicitation. A detailed project description and overall project performance requirements for this project will be included in the Request For Proposals (RFP) package. The solicitation criteria relies upon industry standards, where allowable, to afford the offeror a deg ree of design flexibility while meeting certain specific project requirements. The successful Contractor must design and construct a complete and usable facility, as described in the RFP documents. One solicitation will be issued covering both phases. Prop osals will be evaluated in Phase One to determine which offerors will submit proposals for Phase Two, and an amendment will be issued to those selected offerors. Selection of offerors for involvement in Phase Two will be based on technical approach and per formance capability. Project design requirements will then be added by amendment to the solicitation at the start of the Phase Two stage of the Request For Proposals. A limited number of firms will be invited to participate in the second phase. This projec t will convert Building 5165 into a dual-use facility.  Building 5165, a former Officers Club, contains about 16,500 square feet of space.  Building 5165 is a one-story structure with a finished floor to top-of-roof height of 12 feet at the eaves and 14 fe et at the ridge.  Concrete strip footings support a cast-in-place, reinforced concrete wall foundation that extends upward to finish floor.

<SOLNBR>GMS2
<RESPDATE>041904
<CONTACT>Katherine Hamblin,(937) 255-3594
<DESC>The USAF Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC), on behalf of The Boeing Company ñ Special Operations Forces Aerospace Support Center, is soliciting information  to analyze alternatives for a turreted, Gunship Multispectral Sensor (GMS) to  replace the All Light Level TV (ALLTV) subsystem on the AC-130U Gunship.  The  initial intent is to install four systems under a temporary (T-1) modification  program via a Combat Missions Need Statement.  This announcement is issued for  informational planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation or  commit the Government or the Boeing Company to award a contract now or in the  future.  Submitting information for this announcement is voluntary, and  participants will not be compensated.  The objective of the Gunship Multispectral Sensor (GMS) modification to the AC- 130U Gunship aircraft is to provide enhanced detection, recognition, and  positive combat identification of targets under all light level conditions  without the aid of artificial illumination sources.  The missions of the AC- 130U, equipped with a Multispectral Sensor, include but are not limited to  close air support; troops in combat mission; perimeter/airbase defense; convoy,  helicopter, train or naval escort; air interdiction; reconnaissance/armed  reconnaissance, surveillance; search and rescue support; limited airborne  command and control; forward air controller operations; and other special  operations support missions.  During the conduct of these missions the AC-130U  requires the capability to detect, recognize, and positively identify Special  Operations Forces (SOF) targets and friendly forces from operationally  significant ranges.  The GMS will also provide a laser designation and ranging  capability for weapons delivery, an eye safe laser ranging capability, and a  NIR Pointer for target marking and friendly forces identification. Respondents to this announcement, who are initially determined by The Boeing  Company to be viable suppliers, will be sent a Request For Information (RFI)  and an information package that further defines the system and interface  requirements.  The System Requirements Document (SRD) and the Interface  Description Document (IDD), including any attachments, may contain information  subject to International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR) or Export  Administration Regulation (EAR) of 1979, which may not be exported, released or  disclosed to foreign nationals inside or outside the U.S. without first  obtaining an export license.   Elements of the GMS program are classified to the SECRET level.  Potential  suppliers must possess a valid site security clearance and will be required to  complete a DD254 prior to exchange of any classified information.  The information and data supplied by you as a result of the RFI will be  reviewed by The Boeing Company and may become part of a proposal submitted to  Boeingís customer.   If your company is determined to be a viable candidate supplier, a team of  technical experts may visit your facility to discuss technical details of your  capabilities.  The technical team will be comprised of Boeing and Government  personnel and academic and U.S. Laboratory experts.  This may require  Proprietary Information Agreements (PIAs).  The site visit may take place  approximately 2 weeks after receipt of your response to the RFI. As a result of the technical information received from suppliers and completed  site surveys, viable suppliers may be requested to respond to a Request for  Proposal (RFP).  RFPís will be issued on or about 3 May 2004, with quotes due  no later than 7 June 2004.  A requirement of the RFP will be for the  demonstration of a viable system at a government facility. Tentative schedule  for a side-by-side demonstration of all viable suppliersí systems will be  conducted near the end of August 2004.  Delivery of first turret is expected in  December 05.   Responses to this announcement should be sent via e-mail to GMS2@boeing.com and  must be received no later than COB 19 April 2004.  Responses must include a  general description of your candidate system and its capabilities along with  points of contact to discuss technical, contractual and security questions.  In  addition, if a company website is available to review information pertaining to  a candidate system or similar product line, please include this is the  response.

<DESC>Purpose:  

The United States Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), Management Services Division, seeks to identify sources and receive information on current market prices from individuals and entities providing conservation technical assistance.


Background:  

The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 (the 2002 Farm Bill), Public Law 107-171, expanded the availability of financial and technical assistance funds for implementation of conservation programs.  The current staffing levels of NRCS are insufficient to meet the increased need for technical assistance under the conservation programs.  Section 1242 of the Act expands the availability of technical assistance to producers by encouraging other potential providers of technical assistance to assist in the delivery of technical assistance.  To ensure that high quality assistance is available to all producers, Section 1242 requires the Secretary of Agriculture to establish by regulation, a system for approving individuals and entities to provide technical assistance to carry out programs under the Farm Bill, and establish amounts for payments for assistance.  


Objective:

NRCS is seeking sources of technical services and pricing data for past technical services provided.  NRCS intends to use this pricing data submitted by prospective sources to establish payment rates for technical service providers.

This is a sources sought and request for information announcement--A market survey for information only.  This is not a solicitation announcement for offers and no contract will be awarded from this announcement.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow up information requests.


Requested Response:  

Parties interested in providing pricing information for past conservation technical services need to respond by accessing the TspCost Web page on the internet.  The web address is http://tspcost.sc.egov.usda.gov/  or link from http://sc.egov.usda.gov Information and instructions for populating the database are shown there.

<DESC>This modification to the previous announcement is being issued to change the due date for submission of white papers under this market research from the previously stated time and date to 'no later than close of business (4:00 pm EDST) on by 03 May 2 004'.  The following is a restatement of the initial announcement with the due date and time changed.   The CECOM Acquisition Center Washington is seeking sources on behalf of U.S. Army RDECOM CERDEC, Army Power Division for carbon dioxide (CO2) compressor s suitability for testing by the U.S. Army for use in future Environmental Control Units (ECUs). The U.S. Army requires advanced heating and cooling technology for a variety of equipment applications. One of these is the military family of Environmental Co ntrol Units (ECUs). High performance systems with reduced logistics support requirements and environmentally responsible working fluids are desired. Of specific interest is implementing technology for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The transcri tical carbon dioxide cycle offers these possibilities. The U.S. Army RDECOM CERDEC, Army Power Division, is applying for approval from the Department of Defense to initiate the Foreign Comparative Testing Program for Transcritical CO2 Cooling and Heating T echnology Compressors in Fiscal Year 2005. The Army intends to identify the 4 most promising foreign (non-U.S.) compressor models and procure 2 of each for testing and evaluation. In addition, domestic compressor models will be considered for testing and e valuation. Technical requirements: (1) Capable of compressing CO2 gas for military cooling and hea ting applications; (2) Power type: 208V, 3-phase, 50/60Hz and/or 115V, single-phase, 50/60Hz; (3) Air Cooling outdoor temperature range: 32 deg F to 125 deg F (0 deg C to 51.7 deg C); (4) Range of desired cooling capacities at 125 deg F outdoor, 90 deg F/5 0%RH indoor: 6,000 Btu/h to 120,000 Btu/h (at 51.7 deg C outdoor, 32.2 deg C/50%RH indoor: 1.8 kW to 35 kW); (5) Heat Pump capability desired.

  1.0	BACKGROUND
The procurement of a spare T56-A-15 engine with a ñ423 reduction gearbox (RGB) in a Quick Engine Change Assembly (QECA) is required for the NC-130H Aircraft, BUNO 870157.  This aircraft is being used for risk reduction flight-testing in support of the E-2 Advanced Hawkeye program. The flight test phase of this project will have a highly constrained schedule and this purchase will mitigate the schedule risk attributable to an engine failure. The unique configuration of this engine precludes using existing logistics contract vehicles.

<DESC>Purpose:  

The United States Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), Management Services Division, seeks to identify sources and receive information on current market prices from individuals and entities providing conservation technical assistance.


Background:  

The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 (the 2002 Farm Bill), Public Law 107-171, expanded the availability of financial and technical assistance funds for implementation of conservation programs.  The current staffing levels of NRCS are insufficient to meet the increased need for technical assistance under the conservation programs.  Section 1242 of the Act expands the availability of technical assistance to producers by encouraging other potential providers of technical assistance to assist in the delivery of technical assistance.  To ensure that high quality assistance is available to all producers, Section 1242 requires the Secretary of Agriculture to establish by regulation, a system for approving individuals and entities to provide technical assistance to carry out programs under the Farm Bill, and establish amounts for payments for assistance.  


Objective:

NRCS is seeking sources of technical services and pricing data for past technical services provided.  NRCS intends to use this pricing data submitted by prospective sources to establish payment rates for technical service providers.

This is a sources sought and request for information announcement--A market survey for information only.

<DESC>The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) Upstate New York Service Center is conducting market research to determine the availability of commercial items and commercial installation services (construction) for the replacement of a sidewalk freight elevator in Buffalo, NY.  The Michael J. Dillon U.S. Courthouse is a 1930's vintage building with the current Gillespie PS-1E electric sidewalk freight elevator design and capacity that were adequate for that period.  The elevator car and other major components of this elevator have been replaced, however the unit has not been upgraded to handle the capacity required to satisfy the current needs of the tenants.  The existing car platform and car capacity needs to be increased.

The existing sidewalk elevator occupies a pit containing both the elevator shaft and the elevator mechanical room.  To increase the size of the car, the floor of the mechanical room will require excavation to bring it down to the depth of the elevator shaft with necessary concrete work to accept a new hydraulic two-stop elevator.  With the shaft modifications, a car platform of approximately 6'-3" x 9'-8" could be accommodated with 3000-pound capacity.  The overall dimension of the shaft will be 11'-0"x6'-5" following the planned modifications.  Space is available within the adjacent basement area for the new elevator mechanical room containing the hydraulic pump, controller, and electrical disconnect.

Manufacturers of replacement sidewalk elevator systems, or their authorized local dealers/installers, are requested to respond with commercial catalog cut sheets or a website reference to the attention of Ms. Harriet Mortas at the attached address.  Please indicate the elevator manufacturer, car size, door size, capacity, options, and any applicable constraints in meeting the objectives described above.  The agency is interested in learning about any standard commercial terms and conditions applicable to the replacement of sidewalk freight elevators.  Please also identify the business size status of both the manufacturer and authorized local dealer/installer according to the following categories: large business, small business, Section 8(a), other certified small disadvantaged business, women-owned small business, HUBZone small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, or veteran-owned small business.  The tentative NAICS code for the potential future procurement action is 333921 with a size standard of 500 employees.

This is a sources sought synopsis for information and planning purposes only.  This notice does not constitute a solicitation and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Responses are requested by April 26, 2004.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT ONLY.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.  This synopsis is for informational and planning purposes and does not constitute a request for proposal and is not considered a commitment by the government.  The Air Armament Center, Combat Support Systems, Systems Program Office, Agile Combat Support (AAC/YBC), at Eglin AFB, FL, seeks sources and information on commercially available methods and products to provide materials capable of rapidly repairing spalls and craters on expedient or war-damaged runways and airfields.  The primary objective is to conduct expedient repairs to develop Minimum Operating Strips (MOS) for landing and take-off of military aircraft.  This may include the innovative use of environmentally acceptable chemicals, synthetic materials, and compounds that can be rapidly applied to spalls/craters ranging from a few inches to five feet in diameter.  The materials should be fast curing, environmentally acceptable and should not need highly specialized skills or equipment to apply.  The materials should have a shelf life of at least six (6) months, and once applied, the repair should withstand fighter and cargo aircraft traffic with only minor maintenance required without cracking, flaking or failing.  The Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) incrementally deploys to contingency locations.  Initially, small contingents of personnel and equipment deploy to forward locations to make preparations for the arrival of larger forces.  Before the build-up in the forward locations can continue, there is an ever-increasing need to prepare expedient surfaces to facilitate landing and take-off of aircraft that bring the expeditionary infrastructure and equipment to bed-down the forces.  Often, the forward operating locations have very limited or no usable aircraft minimum operating strips for landing and take off due to neglect or damage suffered during the contingency.  It is essential for the Air Force to have the capability to quickly repair contingency airfield runways.  AAC/YBC wants to involve industry in the very early stages of the acquisition of state of the art materials to quickly repair damaged or neglected airfield surfaces.  To initiate an exchange of information, AAC/YBC requests that interested parties submit any, or both, of the following: (1) up to a 10 page concept paper, with conceptual sketches, if applicable, that identifies potential/existing solutions to include projected materials, equipment and manpower needs, and/or (2) product samples, brochures, marketing materials or analyses or test documentation outlining the specifications and existing capabilities.  As part of your response, please include information on: performance characteristics, commercial availability (sources and outlets), delivery/lead-time, and warranty terms and conditions.  Responses will be evaluated and a list of potential suppliers will be established containing those firms determined capable of fulfilling the Governmentís requirements.  At a later date, the Government may acquire, one or more units for initial testing and evaluation and a subsequent purchase of an unspecified number from one or more of these vendors.  This sources sought/request for information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any follow-on acquisitions. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI, or otherwise pay for the information solicited.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of submission of responses to this RFI and Government use of such information.  The Government reserves the right to reject in whole or in part any industry input as a result of this RFI.  The Government recognizes that proprietary data may be part of this effort.  If so, clearly mark such restricted or proprietary data and present it as an addendum to the non-restricted/non-proprietary information.  For further information concerning technical aspects contact Mr. Jon Simone, Program Engineer, AAC/YBC, 314 W. Choctawhatchee Ave, Suite 104, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-5717, or by telephone at (850) 882-4684, extensions 317, e-mail address: jon.simone@eglin.af.mil.  Firms responding to this synopsis should state whether they are or are not a small business concern or small, disadvantaged business concern as defined by FAR 52.219-1 and 52.219-2, respectively.  Respondents capable of satisfying the requirement should respond via e-mail (preferred) to kurt.buchanan@eglin.af.mil; by facsimile to 850-882-9381; by phone 850-882-4686, ext. 336; or in writing to Attn: Kurt Buchanan, AAC/YBCK, 314 W. Choctawhatchee Ave., Eglin AFB, FL 32542-6861 within 30 calendar days after the publication of this announcement.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT - NON-COLLINEAR WAVEFRONT CURVATURE RANGING SENSORS - The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) has identified a need for new sensors that utilize non-collinear wavefront curvature ranging techniques to discern target motion analysis information from transient contacts. This is a synopsis to locate a low cost non-developmental item (NDI) sensor that utilizes techniques, such as time delay of arrival, to determine range, bearing, and depth of a target based on a single transient intercept. This sensor should have a proven record of success in laboratory and at sea tests. This sensor shall interface with the Naval Active Intercept and Ranging and Collision Avoidance System (NAIRCAS) to improve that systems capabilities, therefore, expertise with the NAIRCAS system is required. Interested parties having the required specialized capabilities to meet all of the above pr oposed requirements should submit to Mr. Chris Pigott, SEA 02623, a two (2) page (maximum) typed expression of interest/capability statement indicating their ability to perform all aspects of the efforts described above.  Offerors should describe at a minimum their manufacturing capability, test equipment, expertise in the area of hyperbolic multilateration dilution of precision, hydrophone modeling, triangulation, and test facilities, which should accommodate the testing of the sensor system.  Responses are required to include the firm name, mailing address, telephone and facsimile numbers, World Wide Web (Internet) presence (if any), size of firm, number of years providing similar level of complexity products, and direct points of contact including phone and e-mail addresses.  Only written responses transmitted electronically, by mail, or facsimile will be accepted.  The Gove rnment will not provide payment for an information provided in response to this synopsis, nor will the Government return any data provided.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT - COMMUNICATION LINK TO SUBMERGED PLATFORMS - The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) has identified a need for a non-developmental item (NDI) submerged platform communication improvement to allow communications between submerged platforms, equipped with the Underwater Communication System (UCS) system utilizing the Hydro Acoustic Information Link (HAIL) or equivalent technology, and surface, air, and space assets.  This improvement must allow the submerged platform to communicate with surface, air, and space assets while the submerged platform is at speed and depth and no changes can be made to any surface, air, or space asset. Due to the need to communicate between multiple platforms from multiple nations, the system must utilize the HAIL technology or be compatible (i.e., able to interface) with HAIL technology to ensure interoperability with current US Navy tech nology in use on US submerged platforms. Interested parties having the required specialized capabilities to meet all of the above proposed requirements should submit to Mr. Chris Pigott, SEA 02623, a two (2) page (maximum) typed expression of interest/capability statement indicating their ability to perform all aspects of the efforts described above.  Offerors should describe at a minimum their manufacturing capability, test equipment, and test facilities, which should accommodate the testing of the communication system.

<DESC>SEE SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICES VANAC-SSN-031804A AND VANAC-SSN-031804B FOR ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR MEDICAL/SURGICAL ITEMS  IF YOU WOULD LIKE A MORE EASILY READABLE COPY OF THIS NOTICE, PLEASE CONTACT SUE PROCTOR AT 708-786-5182 OR SUSAN.PROCTOR@MED.VA.GOV SUBJ:  Sources Sought Notice for Medical/Surgical Items  This is a Market Survey and Request for Samples to locate potential sources for the standardization of various medical/surgical items.  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) desires to offer its customers, on a national basis, the best possible products and prices and to offer its contractors more opportunities within the system.  The intent of the standardization program is to establish national mandatory sources for medical/surgical items to standardize VAís purchasing of products.  BIDS/OFFERS ARE NOT BEING SOLICITED AT THIS TIME.  Request for Quotations (RFQs) will be issued at a later date.   Potential offerors interested in having their items evaluated for possible inclusion in the standardization process should carefully review the item descriptions listed below.  If a company can provide any of these items, SAMPLES OF ALL ITEMS AVAILABLE THAT MEET OR EXCEED THE CRITERIA PROVIDED IN THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS SHOULD BE SUBMITTED AT THIS TIME.  Samples are to be provided at no charge and all samples submitted in response to this notice become property of the VA and will not be returned following the evaluation process. NOTE:  ALL SAMPLES SUBMITTED MUST BE MANUFACTURED IN A DESIGNATED COUNTRY, A CARIBBEAN BASIN COUNTRY, OR A NAFTA COUNTRY (UNITED STATES, CANADA, AND MEXICO).  THE USER GROUP WILL ONLY EVALUATE SAMPLES MANUFACTURED IN APPROVED COUNTRIES.  A LISTING OF DESIGNATED COUNTRIES AND CARIBBEAN BASIN COUNTRIES MAY BE FOUND AT THE FOLLOWING WEBSITE: http://www.acqnet.gov/far/current/html/Subpart_25_1.html#1046559.  All samples submitted must be clearly marked with the name of the potential offeror, the product number, and the manufacturerís name.  Offerors must also include any corresponding detailed product literature with the samples.  Detailed product literature should include, but not limited to, an indication of what materials the products are comprised of (e.g. latex, etc.), country of origin, and a listing of sizes, configurations, etc. available.  Offerors must include a copy of the evaluation criteria contained in this notice with their samples and identify where in the product literature each individual criteria is addressed.  If the product literature does not clearly address any of the criteria information, offerors must provide this information on company letterhead addressing the stated criteria.  A statement that says, ìYes, this product meets this criteriaî is not sufficient; please provide details as to how the product meets the criteria.  In addition, please provide company name, address, contact person and telephone number for questions pertaining to submitted samples.  Also, please provide the company name, address, contact person and telephone number of where any resulting Request for Quotation (RFQ) should be sent.  If detailed literature or sufficient information addressing the evaluation criteria is not received with the samples, the technical evaluation panel will be unable to fully evaluate the samples and the products will be eliminated from further consideration. Offerors are requested to provide procurement history data for the products submitted for evaluation.  Please provide total quantities for each product sold to the VA in the previous 12-month period.  This information will be used to verify the accuracy of the estimated quantities identified in the Request for Quotation (RFQ). VA intends to award Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) against FSS contracts rather than issuing formal solicitations for the purpose of standardization.  Those companies who do not have a current FSS contract will be eliminated from the competition prior to any subsequent BPA award.  For additional information in obtaining an FSS contract, please contact James Booth, Federal Supply Schedule Service at 708/786-5183.  Offerors who have a current FSS contract, must ensure that product samples submitted in response to this Sources Sought Notice are included on their FSS contract prior to any subsequent BPA award. VA will use the items submitted in response to this request for samples and the results of the evaluations performed on those items to determine which companies are requested to participate in the resulting Request for Quotation. Current FSS contract holders must provide a copy of their current FSS pricelist with their samples.  If you do not have a current FSS contract, please indicate if a proposal has been submitted to begin the procurement process that will result in an FSS contract and the anticipated contract award date. A VHA Standardization Workgroup, a group of VA physicians, nurses and clinicians who have expertise and knowledge of the products, will review and technically evaluate any samples submitted.  VA deems the members of the Workgroup to be medical experts.  Therefore, they are qualified to make a subjective determination as to which products are acceptable. **Please send samples (number of samples required follow each product name) and corresponding detailed product literature to: Department of Veterans Affairs, Consolidated Acquisition and Analysis Service (049A5S), ATTN:  Carl Hunter, Building 37, First Avenue - One Block North of Cermak Road (22nd Street), Hines, IL  60141**   SAMPLES AND PRODUCT LITERATURE MUST BE RECEIVED NO LATER THAN MAY 14, 2004.  Companies not submitting samples by this date may be eliminated from consideration on any subsequent procurement action for these items.

<SUBJECT>99--Seal/Bearing Shaft Assembly for the MK 30 Mod 2 Target Propulsion system.
<DESC>The U. S. Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service, intends to make a firm-fixed price, sole source award to Ettem USA INC. Kemah, TX.  GovWorks/DOI intends to issue a Purchase Order in accordance with FAR Part 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items and 6.302-1 only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This non-competitive action is being issued by GovWorks under the authority of the U. S. Department of Interior Franchise Fund on behalf of the NAVSEA Keyport Naval Undersea Warfare Center.  The NAVSEA Keyport Naval Undersea Warfare Center has a requirement for the acquisition of 2 Seal/Bearing/Shaft/Assembly, Damped, IAW Drawing 7353186-1 Rev B, and it's Sub Assembly Drawing 7317329 Rev A.  The estimated total value of this project is $82,000.  The requirement for the Seal/Bearing/Shaft Assembly is a critical element in preparing/maintaining the MK 30Mod 2 ASW Target for initial site activation and fleet training exercises.  Ettem USA, Inc. is the original design contractor of the Seal/Bearing Shaft Assembly and owns the rights to the proprietary design for this critical seal assembly for the MK 30 Mod 2 Target propulsion system.  Any new design would require extensive engineering and qualification testing, and will require review and approval by NUWC Division Newport. Ettem USA, Inc. is the only vendor with the ability to produce a Seal/Bearing/Shaft Assembly to meet NAVSEA Keyport Naval Undersea Warfare Center requirements.  In addition awarding to any source other than Ettem USA, INC would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. This is NOT a request for competitive quotes.  The intent of this Special Notice is for informational purposes only.  However, all information received by 4:30 p.m. EST April 22, 2004, will be considered by the Government.

<SUBJECT>A -- ETS (management and professional services, studies and analyses, engineering & technical services
<DESC>Interested Company,

	AFOTEC would appreciate if you would take some time and answer the questions below.  We are interested in your response and hope that using some of your advice we can better support our contractual requirements.  We would appreciate if you could provide your answers back to us in writing by 23 April 2004.

	HQ AFOTEC/RMC
	Attn:  Roxanna Roda
	8500 Gibson Blvd SE
	Kirtland AFB, NM  87117-5558


Commerciality:

Current acquisition guidance encourages the Government to adopt the best practices of industry by purchasing commercial services.  Do you think this acquisition is commercial?  Please specifically address the following:

	a.  Are these same services provided in the commercial market?
	b.  If so how are these services provided in the commercial market?  In other words, what Government contract type most closely resembles the typical commercial contract used to purchase A&AS?  Consider major terms and conditions in your answer, but focus on the pricing methodology.
	c.  What are other major differences between our requirement and what is accepted commercial business practice?

Metrics:

AFOTEC needs to establish meaningful and measurable metrics for the services required under the ETS contract (management and professional services, studies and analyses, engineering & technical services).  Please provide industry input on how best to develop standards which measure contractor performance, or how, after contract award, to compare one contractor to another doing the same type of work.  It is already assumed the contractor meets all deliverables within budget and schedule requirements of the task order.  Provide as many inputs as feasible, but specific examples might include:

	*	Quality of studies/analyses/reports
	*	Contract/Task Order management
	*	Team management (skills, retention, training, etc.)
	*	Efficiency/Management of Government resources
	*	Cost control/cost avoidance
	*	Responsiveness to customer
	*	Time/budget projections (with milestones)

What other types of performance objectives or performance measurements do you feel are appropriate for this type of effort?  Please explain your answer.

Task orders will primarily be competed using best value to the Government.  How well your company is measured on your current task order will be a factor in whether your company is considered for future task orders.  With this in mind, are the metrics you proposed in response to the previous questions still valid?  Please explain your answer.


Incentives:

Do you feel incentives are appropriate for this type of effort?  If so, which one would be best and why?

Do you feel incentives will add measurable value to the contract?  Please explain your answer and consider the cost of administrating the incentive program into your answer.

Based on the metrics discussed above, what measurements would you use to incentivize the type of work under this contract?

Streamlining RFPs and Task Order Awards/Management

The Government desires a streamlined approach to awarding task orders that maximizes competition.  Request industry provide input and suggestions for streamlining the Task Order Management and RFP process.

What is your definition of a streamlined process for Task Order Management and RFP?  What is a reasonable amount of time to return a streamlined task order proposal?  How might a website facilitate this streamline process?

What is the impact of requiring a bid for each task order in the RFP from each contractor, in that we want maximum competition?  How would maximum competition be maintained without this requirement?

Will task order proposal costs undermine the competition we hope to gain from this contracting scheme?  Please explain your answer.  How do you recommend we mitigate this?

What types of requirements or restrictions on proposals might be useful to streamline and reduce proposal costs (e.g. page limits, oral presentations, etc.).

Do you feel that oral presentations, written proposals or a combination of both has the most benefit to the Government?



Teaming Restrictions:

A Government concern is the ability to maintain competition at the task order level.  This is a particular concern when contractors participate on more that one team.  What do you feel is the impact to competition when team members (primes or subcontractors) participate on more than one team?

If team members are allowed to participate on more than one team, how can the Government be assured that competition will be maintained?

Request industry input on how the Government should address teaming restrictions in the RFP?  Please explain your position.

Number of Contracts:

The Governmentís initial plan is to award up to four contracts.  Please provide your comments on this number of awards.  Would you prefer more awards or fewer awards?  Please explain your answer.  Consider competition, small business participation, and a streamlined task order award process in your answer.

Organization Conflict of Interest (OCI):

The Government anticipates OCI issues at both the contract and task order level.  Request industry input on how the Government should address this issue in the RFP and how industry plans to manage it.

Do you think it would be beneficial for you to provide a draft OCI mitigation plan at the time of the draft RFP?  The Government will review your draft OCI plan and provide feedback.  Will this facilitate your bid/no bid decision?  Please explain your position.

Cost Control:

The Government is concerned with pass-through costs for team members.  How can the Government incentivize you to be innovative in your overhead/management structure to eliminate or significantly reduce ìpass through costsî to subcontractors, and search for ways to realize efficiencies, while still providing quality service?  Should the Government require a contract ceiling for pass-through costs or simply let the competition determine these costs?  Please explain your position.

How can the Government word its evaluation criteria and the resultant contract to achieve this goal?

Do you have a DCAA approved/audited Forward Pricing Rate Agreement (FPRA) for indirect/overhead rates and/or labor rates?  Please clarify what FPRAís you have or why you do not have a FPRA.  Do all your team members/subcontractors have FPRAís?  If not, please explain why.




Clearance Requirements:

What mix of clearance do you currently maintain on your staff ñ Secret, TS, TS/SCI, uncleared?  (70/10/20 percent mix, for example).

Do you have or have access to a non-government owned SCIF?

In the competitive market that will service HQ AFOTEC via the ETS contract, how are you affected by requirements for Secret and SCI cleared personnel?  How do you characterize the pool of cleared/clearable people (suggested terms:  flexible, severely limited, cost prohibitive, ample, front-loaded, open, available, non-existent, manageable)?  Please clarify your answer.

How long do you anticipate it will take to fill an SCI position from the time you identify the need (task order)?

Risks:

What do you see as the risk areas associated with this effort and how would you mitigate these risks.

Please provide any additional feedback you feel is relevant.

Efforts should be made to keep offers as brief as possible, concentrating on substantive information essential for a proper evaluation.  Technical information shall not exceed 20 pages. 2.  Descriptions of the offerorís resources, facilities, and equipment (i.e., including manufacturing, test, computational, analytical, experimental, etc.) proposed for use during the project, including the availability and commitment of the facilities and equipment. The proposal shall also address the same from any subcontractors or outside organizations along with the role of each. 3.  The offerorís proposal shall briefly describe the qualifications and experience of the personnel to be assigned to the project.  4.  FACSIMILE or email offers are acceptable. EVALUATION - COMMERCIAL ITEMS (FAR 52.212-2) (JAN 1999) (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered (See FAR 2.101, Best Value).  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers, with consideration given to the factors of past performance, proposed technical merit, and price.  Offers must provide the following critical information:  1. Information on 3 past Vacuum Chamber contracts, listing contract number, contract value, customer name and point of contact (including address, telephone and fax numbers and e-mail address, if available) description of the vacuum chamber and status of the contract.  Offerors will not be penalized for lack of Government contracting experience.  2.  A matrix showing how each part of the Statement of Work and specifications will be met and tested. 3.  Description of standards and practices for welding, cleaning, and vacuum leak testing. 4.  Description of vendor quality control standards. This procurement shall be conducted utilizing Best Value Selection (BVS), which seeks to select an offer based on the best combination of price and qualitative merit of the offers submitted and reduce the administrative burden on the offerors and the Government.  BVS takes advantage of the lower complexity of simplified acquisition	procurements and predefines the value characteristics which will serve as the discriminators among offers. BVS evaluation is based on the premise that, if all offers are of approximately equal qualitative merit, award will be made to the offeror with the lowest evaluated price (fixed-price contracts) .  However, the Government will consider awarding to an offeror with higher qualitative merit if the difference in price is commensurate with added value.	Conversely, the Government will consider making award to an offeror whose proposal has lower qualitative merit if the price (or cost) differential between it and other proposals warrant doing so. The statement of work included serves as the Government's baseline requirements. Those offers determined to meet the baseline requirements will be judged against these value characteristics listed below which establish what the Government considers to be valuable in an offer beyond the baseline requirements. The value characteristics are performance based and permit selection of the offer, which provides better results for a reasonable increase in price. All these factors combined are approximately equal to cost or price.   On those value characteristics the offeror chooses to provide, adequate information should be submitted to permit proper evaluation. The following value characteristics are applicable to this procurement: 1. The vacuum chamber, testing and documentation exceed the requirements of the Statement of Work.  3. The relevant qualifications and experience of the key assigned personnel and their level of proposed commitment to the project. 4. The quality of equipment and facilities of the offeror proposed to perform the work specified. 5. The quality of offerorís past performance on contracts delivering similar vacuum chambers. Offerors must include completed copies of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items with their offer. These may be obtained via the internet at URL:	    http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/eps/Templates/Commercial_Greater_Than_25K.doc 	 . These representations and certifications will be incorporated by reference in any resultant contract. An ombudsman has been appointed -- See NASA Specific Note "B". Prospective offerors shall notify this office of their intent to submit an offer.  It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the following Internet site for the release of solicitation amendments (if any):	    http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=73	      .

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to procure consulting services in support of the Research Business Models Subcommittee (RBM) on a sole source basis from Connie Atwell, Rockville, MD.  The purchase order term will be April 15, 2004 through April 14, 2005 with options for three (3) successive one-year periods.  The purpose of the Committee on Science is to advise and assist the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC), with emphasis on those federally supported efforts that develop new knowledge in the sciences, mathematics, and engineering.  Dr. Atwell has served as the co-chair of the Research Business Models Subcommittee of the Committee on Science for the past year.  She has unique knowledge of the issues to be addressed by the three Working Groups.  Together with Dr. Rodney Brown and Mr. Geoffrey Grant, Dr. Atwell led the establishment of priorities for the Subcommittee and has been involved with setting up the working plans for each of the priority issues.  Dr. Atwell will continue to coordinate the various issue groups and provide staff support to Dr. Norka Ruiz Bravo, who is now the co-chair of the Subcommittee.  She will also serve as the Steward for the group addressing the issue of co-Principal Investigators on research grants.  Dr. Atwell's background includes over 25 years of experience in research grant and contract administration.  For the past 11 years she was the Director of the Division of Extramural Research at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke at the NIH, where she had responsibility for all of the scientific programs as well as the peer review, grants and contracts administration, and administrative services for a budget in excess of $1 billion.  She has chaired several committees concerned with improving the efficiency and effectiveness of research administration and has been on the Executive Committee of the Federal Demonstration Partnership (FDP), which is a public-private partnership also concerned with these same issues.  Most recently she served as the Senior Science Adviser to the FDP, appointed by the Office of Science and Technology Policy.  The Presidential Review Directive IV calls for periodic reviews of the relationship of the federal research agencies and the university research performance community.  The Research Business Models Subcommittee, which Dr. Atwell has co-chaired, is the vehicle for implementing this presidential mandate.  It is imperative that Dr. Atwell provide continuity for executing the mission of the Research Business Models Subcommittee.  The proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 12 - Commercial Items.
