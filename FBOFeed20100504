<DESC>UPDATED FROM 2009 DRAFT (W52H09-10-R-0042) ARCHIVED on 28 FEB 2010: Expeditionary Electrical Test Shop for the U.S. Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM). This test set will include computerized test equipment, tools, adaptors, and any other necessary supplies to fully test and verify the operational condition of electrical system components from a wide variety of USMC tactical and non-tactical ground vehicles and equipment. The electrical system components that require testing include alternators, starters, generators, and regulators. Currently, it is anticipated that the set will take advantage of commercially available testers to simultaneously load test both alternators and starters. The set is anticipated to include separate load testers for alternators and starters. Generator testing is anticipated to take place on the alternator test machine. Regulator testing is anticipated to take place by exchanging the regulator under test for a known good regulator and re-testing the alternator. To meet deployment and transportation requirements, this test set will be fully integrated into a one-side hard-skinned expandable steel shelter meeting ISO 1C standards (8 width x 8 height x 20 length). No canvas or other soft-sided expansions will be allowed. This shelter will also have an integral bale-arm and flatrack that will allow the shelter to be loaded and unloaded using the Load Handling System of the LVSR. The shelter will be certified safe to ship by the Coast Guard or an authorized approval entity. Additionally, the shelter will have integrated spreader bars and forklift pockets in order to take full advantage of all material handling equipment in use by the USMC. It is an objective for the gross mass of the set to be below 15,000 pounds. The test set will include input connections for Mobile Electric Power (MEP) units and Environmental Control Units (ECU) found in the USMC inventory.

<DESC>The Naval Medical Logistics Command intends to negotiate on a sole source basis (IAW FAR 13.501) with Novadaq Corporation, as the only responsible source that can provide an intaoperative vascular imaging system.  This acquisition is being conducted under the FAR 13.501 test procedures for commercial items. Provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-24 are incorporated.


The Naval Medical Center San Diego has a requirement for an intraoperative vascular imaging system for Naval Medical Center San Diego.  The intraoperative vascular imaging system is the only technology that is able to measure blood perfusion using fluorescence and no radiation. The Spy SP2000 System from Novadaq is the system that meets the minimum requirements of the government.

NMC San Diego has a requirement for an intraoperative vascular imaging system.  The system shall include the following components: intraoperative vascular imaging system, laser camera, daqpac software, computer with hard drive and CD/DVD burner, 17 LCD monitor, keyboard, image printer, cart, and training/education. The system shall be able to measure blood perfusion in tissue without the use of radiation and using dye fluorescence.  The system shall be multispecialty capable (plastic surgery, cardiac, organ transplants, micro-surgeries).  The electrical requirements for this system are 120 V, 60 Hz, and single phase.

The intraoperative vascular imaging system (SPY SP2000), from Novadaq, is the only technology that is able to measure blood perfusion using fluorescence and no radiation.  Because this technology is able to measure tissue blood perfusion before the surgery is complete, it is less likely that another surgery will be need based on necrotic tissue. Also, this technology will improve patient safety with less radiation to the patient and fewer repeat surgeries.

<DESC>PRECLINICAL TOXICOLOGY &amp; PHARMACOLOGY OF DRUGS DEVELOPED FOR CANCER AND OTHER DISEASES
<p>The Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP) of the Division of Cancer Treatment, Diagnosis and Centers (DCTDC) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) intends to re-compete a requirement currently being performed under contracts N01CM42200, N01CM42201, N01CM42202, N01CM42203, and N01CM42204. This procurement is being competed under full and open competitive procedures under NAICS 541712. DTP is seeking organizations to carry out pharmacology and toxicology studies, the data from which must be suitable for filing with the Food and Drug Administration as part of Investigational New Drug Applications. The organizations should have the facilities and staff to carry out such studies and the management expertise to analyze and evaluate the data.</p>
<p>Multiple contracts will be awarded and each will be administered on a work assignment-managed basis. Work assignments will be issued under the "funded cost-reimbursement, multiyear" contracts resulting from this solicitation. Assignments are estimated to involve two to three chemical agents annually, per contract The objectives of the work assignments in relative order of importance are: 1) assessment of acute and subacute toxicity in rodents and dogs including determination of a maximum tolerated dose (MTD), of dose limiting toxicities (DLT), schedule-dependent toxicity, of the reversibility of adverse effects and of a safe clinical starting dose; 2) validation of analytical methodology to quantitate plasma drug levels in preclinical animal models and to measure plasma drug levels in rodents, dogs and/or non-human primates treated with the agent under study; 3) determination of bioavailability of drug after parenteral and/or oral administration, if efficacious drug levels can be attained in plasma in vivo and if the drug crosses the blood-brain barrier; 4) the use of pharmacokinetic information to permit extrapolation of toxic effects across species by relating plasma drug levels to the time of appearance and severity of toxicity; and to establish the safety of potentially efficacious doses.</p>
<p>The Principal Investigator should have a doctoral degree in pharmacology/ toxicology plus at least five years experience in directing, implementing and evaluating drug toxicity studies in experimental animals. The Pathologist, Pharmacokineticist and Analytical Chemist should likewise have credentials that illustrate their competence and accomplishments in serving as critical team members in the conduct of such studies.</p>
<p>The government anticipates multiple awards of multiyear contracts with increments of funding. <br /><br />Mandatory Qualification/Mandatory Exclusion Criteria:</p>
<p>The GLP qualification must be met at the time of submission of the initial proposal. Since the toxicology studies will be used by the National Cancer Institute to satisfy the safety testing requirement of the Food and Drug Administration in the submission of an Investigational New Drug Application, the studies must be conducted and the data must be stored in accordance with the Good Laboratory Practice Regulations as outlined in the Federal Register Friday, December 22, 1978.</p>
<p>The NCI also signs legally binding agreements with certain suppliers (often pharmaceutical or chemical companies) which state that all information on the compounds submitted by the supplier must be held confidential. The Contractor will be expected to evaluate the toxicity of such commercially confidential (discreet) materials. Therefore, the Contractor must be willing to sign a Confidentiality of Information Agreement at the time of award.</p>
<p>Mandatory Exclusion Criterion</p>
<p>The Offeror may not be a pharmaceutical, chemical, or biotechnology firm. For purposes of this RFP, a pharmaceutical, chemical or Biotechnology Company is defined as an organization which sells drugs and/or chemicals to the general public for profit or is engaged in research leading to such products.</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) requires that prior to awarding of funds for contracts involving the use or intended use of animals in research; an acceptable assurance statement must be on file with the Office for Protection from Research Risks (OPRR).</p>
<p>REPORTS AND DELIVERABLES: The following reports will be required: Draft Study Report, Final Study Report, Monthly Technical Progress Report, Annual Technical Progress Report, and Final Report.</p>
<p>ANTICIPATED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: The anticipated period of performance is five years (4/1/2011 through 3/31/2016).</p>
<p>CONFIDENTIALITY. No proprietary, classified, confidential, or sensitive information should be included in your response. The Government reserves the right to use any non-proprietary technical information in any resultant solicitation(s).</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER AND IMPORTANT NOTES. This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted.</p>
<p>This solicitation is scheduled for release on or about April 30, 2010. The RFP may be accessed through the NCI Office of acquisitions home page located at <br />http://rcb.cancer.gov/rcb-internet/index.jsp.

<DESC>The mission of the Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP), DCTD, NCI centers on the discovery and preclinical development of agents with clinical anticancer potential. Preclinical pharmacokinetic and metabolism studies are an early and integral part of the overall drug development process and contract resources for preclinical development studies have existed in DTP continuously since the late 1970s. Characterization of the pharmacokinetics of new compounds provides important information for the selection of optimal drug development candidates and for the design and interpretation of preclinical efficacy studies, including the selection of formulations, routes, and schedules of administration. Moreover, one objective of preclinical toxicology evaluations is the correlation of toxic effects of a compound with plasma concentrations and/or area under the curve (AUC). The successful outcome of these studies thus depends heavily on the availability of sensitive methods for quantifying compounds in biological fluids and the careful integration of preclinical pharmacology and toxicology data.<br /><br /><br />Project Requirements<br /><br />Activities of any contract awarded from the proposed solicitation will include, but not be limited to, the following tasks:
<p>(1) Development of sensitive analytical methods to quantify compounds in plasma, urine, tissues, and other biological matrices;</p>
<p>(2) Plasma stability and protein binding studies, which are conducted at an early stage of compound development to ensure proper sample handling and to aid in the interpretation of in vivo studies;</p>
<p>(3) Pharmacokinetic evaluation of test compounds following administration to animals by various routes and schedules, including a determination of bioavailability by various routes;</p>
<p>(4) Quantification and identification of drug metabolites generated in vivo and in various in vitro systems (S9 fractions,<br /><br /><br />Anticipated Period of Performance</p>
<p>The anticipated period of performance will consist of five (5) years, from December 15, 2010 through December 14, 2015.</p>
<p><br />Mandatory Qualification/Mandatory Exclusion Criteria</p>
<p>Supporting documentation demonstrating compliance with the Mandatory Qualification and Mandatory<br />Exclusion Criteria listed below must be included with the initial proposal submission.</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY- The funding for this requirement will be made available under the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act (ARRA) and all qualification criteria that arise from the use of ARRA funding apply to this requirement. This requirement is a partial small business set-aside. <br />
<p><br />It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure, as part of its "Medical Advanced Research Projects Initiative" feasibility or "proof of concept" studies that could serve as the basis for future longer-term, more extensive research projects, that evaluate the feasibility of using innovative computational approaches to enhance the ability of clinicians and biomedical scientists to solve one or more significant cognitive tasks and bring improvement in medical care to patients, families, and the public. The focus of this requirement is to fund meritorious projects that are innovative and offer significant technological advances in NLM's mission in the fields of science and health.</p>
<p>The debate about whether the human brain is a protoplasmic "digital computer" or functions by other means does not preclude continuing interest in the possibility that computers can carry out tasks that would be viewed as requiring intelligence if performed by humans. Artificial intelligence (AI), a term coined in 1956, seemed to have limitless potential, including the development of "thinking machines" such as HAL, in Kubrick's film, 2001: a Space Odyssey. Much was accomplished in knowledge representation, programming languages, and in development of expert systems that could do useful things in this or that domain. The latter, "partially intelligent artifacts", however, fell far short of duplicating the general intelligence of the human. Key challenges, for example, understanding of natural language in texts and speech, as well as generation of innovative ideas and discovery, remain partially or wholly unresolved. Because few today believe that "strong AI" i.e. human-like cognition or better, is a likely near-term achievement, research and development largely gravitated to "weak" or "applied" AI, intended to produce "smart" tools, such as a security system capable of face recognition.</p>
<p>To invigorate research in the arena of computation and cognition (and to avoid the increasingly diffuse connotations of the term "AI" Artificial Intelligence), a number of fresh concepts, each focused on somewhat different aspects of the issues, have arisen in recent years: computational intelligence, machine learning, intelligence amplifying systems, flexible competence, human-computer collaboration, and computational thinking inter alia.</p>
<p>For NLM, three factors have combined to rekindle interest in the potential of computation to carry out more ambitious cognitive tasks.</p>
<p>&bull; Continued advances in information technology and computer science<br /><br />&bull; Increased awareness that "intelligent" behavior by computers requires substantial understanding of the operational decision space, and the more distantly related surrounding turf.<br /><br />&bull; Redirection of goal from replacement of humans to enhancement of human intelligence by a human-machine partnership.</p>
<p>In biomedicine, clinicians and researchers now face formidable challenges in information management, innovation, and decision-making in an era which is seeing extraordinarily rapid growth of knowledge, distributed among a host of databases, and on a scale far larger than can be mastered by an individual. NLM believes that the remarkable speed, memory, and symbol-manipulating power of computers, if properly harnessed, can complement human cognitive strengths so as to enable efficient use of all of the knowledge relevant to solution of clinical and scientific problems.</p>
<p>The purpose of this procurement is to obtain contract development services that will develop and test computational approaches to one or more cognitive problems as commonly encountered by clinician, clinical researcher, biologist, or patient. NLM places no constraint on approach. Artificial neural nets, fuzzy systems, evolutionary computation, statistical (e.g., Bayesian inference, regression, etc.) and other methods, alone or in combination are acceptable as are novel approaches. NLM expects that progress on each proposed project will be an exploratory focus on feasibility testing; full scale development and formal testing are not requirements.</p>
<p>NLM intends to fund multiple contract awards to address these issues, with emphasis on novel approaches to computational thinking, and expects to fund a broad variety of methods of procedure in order to obtain an overview of what is promising in this arena and what is not.</p>
<p>Deliverables will be reports provided to NLM that include:<br />Introduction<br />Methodology<br />Results<br />Discussion<br />Proposed Future Directions<br />Summary<br />References</p>
<p>All deliverables must be free from encumbering licenses or restrictions.</p>
<p>The period of performance is anticipated to be for a one (1) year period.<br />This notice is for informational purposes only. This is not a RFP. The Request for Proposals (RFP) is expected to be released on or about May 20, 2010 through the website at http://FedBizOpps.gov. POTENTIAL OFFERORS WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR DOWNLOADING THEIR OWN COPY OF THE SOLICITATION AND AMENDMENTS. Requests for the RFP will not be accepted via telephone, fax or e-mail. Offers will be tentatively due by July 6, 2010. Awards of this project are anticipated on or about August 20, 2010. Questions regarding this notice may be addressed to shorse@mail.nlm.nih.gov, ATTN: Shari Shor, Contract Specialist. Please reference HHS-NIH-NLM-RDPS-10-121-SES on all correspondence. All responsible and responsive small business sources may submit a proposal that shall be considered by the National Library of Medicine. This requirement will allow for two pre-solicitation notices and two solicitation notices; one small business set-aside and one full and open. In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov. This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract.</p>

Because few today believe that "strong AI" i.e. human-like cognition or better, is a likely near-term achievement, research and development largely gravitated to "weak" or "applied" AI, intended to produce "smart" tools, such as a security system capable of face recognition.</p>
<p>To invigorate research in the arena of computation and cognition (and to avoid the increasingly diffuse connotations of the term "AI" Artificial Intelligence), a number of fresh concepts, each focused on somewhat different aspects of the issues, have arisen in recent years: computational intelligence, machine learning, intelligence amplifying systems, flexible competence, human-computer collaboration, and computational thinking inter alia.</p>
<p>For NLM, three factors have combined to rekindle interest in the potential of computation to carry out more ambitious cognitive tasks.</p>
<p>&bull; Continued advances in information technology and computer science<br /><br />&bull; Increased awareness that "intelligent" behavior by computers requires substantial understanding of the operational decision space, and the more distantly related surrounding turf.<br /><br />&bull; Redirection of goal from replacement of humans to enhancement of human intelligence by a human-machine partnership.</p>
<p>In biomedicine, clinicians and researchers now face formidable challenges in information management, innovation, and decision-making in an era which is seeing extraordinarily rapid growth of knowledge, distributed among a host of databases, and on a scale far larger than can be mastered by an individual. NLM believes that the remarkable speed, memory, and symbol-manipulating power of computers, if properly harnessed, can complement human cognitive strengths so as to enable efficient use of all of the knowledge relevant to solution of clinical and scientific problems.</p>
<p>The purpose of this procurement is to obtain contract development services that will develop and test computational approaches to one or more cognitive problems as commonly encountered by clinician, clinical researcher, biologist, or patient. NLM places no constraint on approach. Artificial neural nets, fuzzy systems, evolutionary computation, statistical (e.g., Bayesian inference, regression, etc.) and other methods, alone or in combination are acceptable as are novel approaches. NLM expects that progress on each proposed project will be an exploratory focus on feasibility testing; full scale development and formal testing are not requirements.</p>
<p>NLM intends to fund multiple contract awards to address these issues, with emphasis on novel approaches to computational thinking, and expects to fund a broad variety of methods of procedure in order to obtain an overview of what is promising in this arena and what is not.</p>
<p>Deliverables will be reports provided to NLM that include:<br />Introduction<br />Methodology<br />Results<br />Discussion<br />Proposed Future Directions<br />Summary<br />References</p>
<p>All deliverables must be free from encumbering licenses or restrictions.</p>
<p>The period of performance is anticipated to be for a one (1) year period.<br />This notice is for informational purposes only. This is not a RFP. The Request for Proposals (RFP) is expected to be released on or about May 20, 2010 through the website at http://FedBizOpps.gov.

Include a summary of qualifications in narrative discussion addressing each of the above selection evaluation criteria on the SF 330, Part 1, Section H.  If necessary, continue on plain bond paper.  For selection criteria (3) the government will also evaluate each firm's past performance and performance rating(s) from the Architect-Engineer Contract Administration Support System (ACASS) during the evaluation process, which can affect the selection outcome.  For selection criteria (8), the Government will evaluate firms by:  In support of Sub-factor (A), (1) the offeror shall provide historical data on utilization of SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone SB, and SDVOSB over the past three years showing dollar value, percentage of work (of total contract value) subcontracted to large businesses, SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone SB, and SDVOSB; (2) Information on national awards received for outstanding support to SB concerns.  National awards received within the last five years will be considered more favorably than national awards beyond five years; (3) Information showing ratings received on completed projects with regards to the firms implementation of subcontracting plans; (4) Information on any existing, planned or pending mentor-protg agreements under either the DOD or SBA 8(a) Programs; (5) Information on use of Community Rehabilitation Program organizations certified under the Javits Wagner O Day Program by the National Industry for the Severely Handicapped (NISH) or the National Industry for the Blind (NIB); and (6) Final SF 294s/Individual Subcontracting Reports on projects completed within the past 3 years, and if subcontracting goals were not met, provide an explanation.  In support of Sub-factor (B), the offeror shall identify each sub-consultant by name, discipline and size status and also identify, in terms of dollar values and percentage of total proposed price, the extent of work you will perform as the prime contractor.  The offeror is advised that the Government-wide goals for the total value of all prime contracts per fiscal year are 23% to SB, 5% each to SDB, WOSB and 3% each to HUBZone SB and SDVOSB.  In addition, the Naval Facilities Engineering Command FY10 subcontracting targets in term of dollar value of subcontracts are 65.65% to SB, 16.27% to SDB, 14.68% to WOSB, 1.37% to HUBZone SB and 3% to SDVOSB.

<DESC>The Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center (NFESC), Port Hueneme,California, has the requirement for the effort to merge Assessment Systemfor Hazard Surveys (ASHS) and Munitions Survivability Software (MSS)software capabilities into the Explosives Safety Siting (ESS) softwaremodule as well as to develop additional functionality not available in anyof the software programs.  Specific tasks are identified in the AutomatedExplosives Safety Site Planning Requirements Document (ASPRD) and in Section5 of this document.  The ESS software will be expanded to includeexpeditionary site planning tools provided in the ASHS and MSS softwarepackages.  Additional graphical data layers that can easily be created byusers and extensive graphical editing commands will be added to allow usersto create or update maps to account for rapidly changing circumstances inthe field.  Special tools will be added to allow the user to automate the siting offacilities represented by complex graphics.  For example, measured distancesbetween an above-ground magazine may be different, depending on whether thefacility being sited is a potential explosive site (PES), or an exposed site(ES).  Additional tools will be provided to allow quick and accurate sitingof new facilities inside of existing development constraints and to accountfor reduced separation distances provided by barricade protection.
New geospatial tools will be developed to assist a user to compare andupdate maps as they change over time.  Tools will be provided to closelytrack changes to data so that configuration management is not lost whenedits are made to copies of the 'official' map of record at any DoDinstallation.  Extensive wizard help commands and training aids will be developed toassist users to quickly become proficient with the use of the software andto recall how to execute software commands when the software hasn't beenused for an extended period of time.
A standardized site approval submittal package format will be developed thatwill be the same for all Military Services.  Tools for identifying andmitigating rule violations will be developed to allow the user to overrideviolations as justified by Engineering Analyses, Terrain analysis, RiskAnalysis, Grandfather Clauses, or other rationale.
Prior to submitting a proposal please complete the Non-Disclosure statement(see attachment) and electronically submit to the Naval FacilitiesEngineering Service Center, Phil Wager (e-mail phillip.wager@navy.mil) for acopy of the ESS Source Code.
An Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), Firm-Fixed-Price, singleaward contract will be awarded. The ordering period will be for a period of five (5) years. Thisprocurement is being processed in accordance with FAR 15, contracting byNegotiations using a Request for Proposal. This requirement is a 100% SmallBusiness set-aside. Offers from other than small business concerns will notbe considered. 
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541511.The Small Business Size Standard is $25 Mil. 
After proposals are evaluated, an award will be made with reasonablepromptness to that responsible bidder to the Government, consideringtechnical and the price-related factors included in the solicitation.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>This Sources Sought Notice is a Request for Information (RFI) and for planning purposes only.  This is not a pre-solicitation or solicitation announcement and no contract will be awarded from this Notice.  The Department of State will not answer any questions regarding this market research.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this Notice.

RFI Focus:

The Department of State is interested in determining the availability of potential businesses that have the capabilities to perform Global Logistical Meeting Support Services.  This support will be performed worldwide.

BACKGROUND

Launched in 2003 by President George W. Bush, the Presidents Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (PEPFAR) holds a place in history as the largest effort by any nation to combat a single disease. In the first five years of the program, PEPFAR focused on establishing and scaling up prevention, care and treatment programs. It achieved success in expanding access to HIV prevention, care and treatment in low-resource settings. During its first phase, PEPFAR supported the provision of treatment to more than 2 million people, care to more than 10 million people, including more than 4 million orphans and vulnerable children, and prevention of mother-to-child treatment services during nearly 16 million pregnancies.

On July 30, 2008, H.R. 5501, the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008 was signed into law.  This Law authorized funding over the next 5 years to combat global HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria.

This global epidemic requires a comprehensive, multisectoral approach that expands access to prevention, care and treatment. As PEPFAR works to build upon its successes, it will focus on transitioning from an emergency response to promoting sustainable country programs.

In this second phase of PEPFAR, a new program strategy is underway that supports the Administration's overall emphasis on improving health outcomes, increasing program sustainability and integration, and strengthening health systems. Some of these changes are already being implemented with planning and programming for FY 2010. Over the next year, PEPFAR will be working closely with country teams in order to translate, prioritize, and implement this strategy in a manner appropriate to the country context. For more information on the broader strategic framework for PEPFAR activities, please visit www.pepfar.gov.  

Due to the nature and the global interest of the PEPFAR program, we require a firm that has had vast and proven experience in organizing and facilitating large meetings (up to 1,500 persons+) internationally. This top-notch company must have demonstrated the ability to handle complex program logistics associated with the meeting, specifically in resource limited settings. The expectations of the meeting stake holders: the US Government [Headquarters and field staff], host country government as well as our multilateral partners, are exceedingly high. The day-to-day operational challenges are unique, but not uncommon. Given that there are varying interests (US Government, host country government, multilateral partners) in organizing these meetings, an exceptionally high level of diplomacy and efficiency is required. The company must have experience working with US Government embassies abroad, cabinet ministers, including the Office of the President and the Presidents protocol officers (not simply travelling or escorting these individuals) as well as heads of international organizations such as the Global Fund and the agencies within the United Nations. The firm must also have the availability of up-front-capital to make advance payments required by many international facilities and vendors.

<DESC>The purpose of this notice/solicitation is to competitively issue an undetermined number of Basic Ordering Agreements (BOA) for various types of Multi Trade Construction projects to include design to build construction at Aviano and Ghedi Air Bases, Italy.
<p>The proposed Basic Ordering Agreement is included in this notice.<br />A basic ordering agreement is not a contract.<br />Each order issued shall be subject to the contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms, conditions and pricing of the BOA.</p>
<p>Firms issued a BOA may receive requests for technical and/or price proposals leading to award of orders. Issuance of Basic Ordering Agreements will be based on evaluation of qualifications in accordance with the criteria as set forth below. Award of specific orders as requirements arise will be based on price and other factors as deemed desirable and set forth for each specific requirement. Specific Firm Fixed Price orders will be competed among those firms issued a BOA. The Government, in its sole discretion, will determine which, and how many, of the firms holding BOA's will be requested to submit price and technical proposals for requirements leading to Firm Fixed Price orders. The approximate range in value of orders is expected to be $650.00 to $1,500,000.00 (Euro 500.00 to Euro 1,160,550.00). The foreseen average number of orders per year is 19 for an approximate aggregate value range between $8 million and $15 million (Euro 7,737,000.00 and Euro 11,605,000.00). The majority of projects have been for vertical multi trade construction efforts.</p>
<p>Under this Multi Trade Construction program, firms selected for a BOA will compete on task orders for requirements. If adequate competition cannot be obtained, the Government reserves the right to open the area of competition to include non BOA holders. There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount or volume of work that will be ordered under the agreement.<br />Government funds are obligated only to the extent that a duly issued order creates such obligation.</p>
<p>Pricing: In order to provide maximum flexibility for market conditions, economies of scale and quantity considerations and other price driving factors, firms will be required to submit Not to Exceed coefficients for each year of the anticipated 5 year duration of the BOA. Each order under the BOA shall be on a Firm Fixed Price basis. The order proposal cannot be based on prices that exceed the ceiling coefficient for the applicable period.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer will open/advertise the BOA program through the Federal Business Opportunities website (http://www.fbo.gov) for new entrants once a year or at intervals that will guarantee adequate competition for this specific Multi Trade Construction program. The BOA can only be changed by modification of the agreement itself and not by individual orders issued under the BOA. Modification of the BOA shall not retroactively affect orders issued prior to the time of the modification. A BOA may be cancelled by either party by mailing or otherwise transmitting 30 days prior written notice to the other party. Any such cancellation shall have no effect on any orders issued prior to the effective date of the cancellation, which shall be 30 days from the date of mailing or otherwise transmitting the written notice of cancellation. Prior to the effective date of cancellation, the 31st Contracting squadron may continue to place orders under the BOA.</p>
<p>Firms that demonstrate that they meet the following qualifications will be considered for issuance of a BOA. Approximately five (5) BOA's will be issued to the most qualified firms for each of the classifications listed below. Firms selected for each classification may participate in order solicitations at or below their classification level, but not for higher classifications. Upon submission of the following information, the Government will review the documents and each firm will be determined to be either eligible or ineligible.</p>

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Award a Sole Source Procurement. The Government intends to issue a sole source contract for the privatization of the water distribution and wastewater collection systems for the Kingsley Field Air National Guard Base (ANGB) located at Klamath Falls International Airport (IAP), to the City of Klamath Falls.  Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements. The City (Contractor) will assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility systems and will be required to provide expansions to the systems to meet future needs of the government.  The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility system.  The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility systems in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.  The utility systems will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  The water distribution and wastewater collection systems being privatized are described as follows: the Kingsley Field Air National Guard occupies 61 acres of leased land on the Klamath Falls International Airport, located approximately 4 miles southeast of Klamath Falls, Oregon. There are 5 administrative, 1 dorm, 1 services and 66 industrial buildings totaling approximately 500,000 square feet with approximately 500 full-time personnel.  A unit training drill is conducted once a month and results in a surge of up to a total of 750 personnel. Water is supplied by the City of Klamath Falls and enters the base at one point. The configuration is a looped system with water delivered at 60 psig.  The distribution system consists of approximately 15,900 linear feet of PVC pipe, 9,900 linear feet of cast iron pipe, 900 linear feet of copper pipe, 7,900 linear feet of transite pipe, and 300 linear feet of galvanized pipe, with tracer wire only on the PVC pipe. Piping diameter ranges from 0.75 inches to 16 inches. The system also has 44 cast iron-gate valves, 16 brass valves, 41 fire hydrant assemblies and 3 backflow devices. The wastewater collection system operates via gravity flow and exits the base at six locations. The wastewater collection system consists of approximately 5100 linear feet of PVC pipe, 2700 linear feet of transite pipe; and 7400 linear feet of vitrified clay pipe, without tracer wire or warning tape and pipe diameters range in size from two to ten inches. There are 26 brick manholes ranging in depth from four to ten feet, 11 pre-cast manholes ranging in depth from four to six feet, five wastewater pumps from one to five horsepower and five lift stations.  Competitive proposals were requested in 2001. One offer was received and subsequently withdrawn on the water distribution and wastewater collection system. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of DoD Utility Privatization Policy dated 2002.  However, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This information shall include: confirmation of your understanding that the requirement includes purchasing the distribution systems, and then entering into a 50-year contract for the operation, maintenance, repair and replacement of the systems; furnish us with references indicating your prior experience operating, maintaining, repairing and replacing such systems; and indicate how you would meet the emergency response time requirement of one hour.  All responses received within ten calendar days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Interested sources shall contact Jerry Fuls at jerry.fuls.ang.af.mil or via phone at 541-885-6495.

THIS INFORMATION IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. THIS AWARD ANNOUNCEMENT IS BEING ISSUED TO INCORPORATE RECOVERY ACT REPORTING INFORMATION FOR CONTRACT AWARD.
DESCRIPTION OF WORK: The objective of the project is to reconstruct the failed dams on the East Cape Canal Extension and Homestead Canal with minimum impact on the natural conditions. Currently, the failed Dams allow seawater to cyclically flush into and out of the Park on a daily basis in response to normal fluctuations in tide elevations. The following are the general work elements:
1) Establishment of a Permitted landside staging area in the Florida Keys or elsewhere on the West or East coasts of Florida for the staging, loading and movement of equipment and materials to be used in construction.2) Mobilization of personnel, equipment and materials to the offshore and canal staging areas.3) Limited clearing of vegetation in the immediate Work site areas and trimming of mangrove trees and other vegetation along the canal banks as required accessing the Work sites.4) The removal of two (2) existing failed sheet pile wall dams on the East Cape Canal Extension and Homestead Canals.  Existing sheet pile wall dams are to be completely removed or cut off at the bottom of the canal just abovethe mud line and removed from the park.5) The failed dams are to be replaced with plugs of back fill 100 feet in length and contained by either new sheet piling or geotubes at the ends of the plugs. Upstream and downstream areas adjacent to the end plugcontainments are to be protected by a graded rip rap system.6) Downstream and upstream erosion protection using Riprap is proposed for both Dam sites to prevent bank erosion in the areas immediately downstream of the Dam containment system.7) Recreational components will constructed at each dam site to consist of a pile restrained floating dock and landing area for canoes and kayaks. A hardened walking path consisting of a concrete in filled geoweb underlain by geotextile fabric is to be constructed across each fill plug to provide portage for canoeist, kayakers, fisherman and others visiting the area.8) Miscellaneous improvements including channel markers, mooring buoys and other signage are to be constructed for the project.
The project will be constructed under a single prime contract

DeVenCI uses workshops, technical expositions, industry outreach, and a publicly available web portal (http://devenci.dtic.mil/) to increase the visibility of DoD needs to commercial companies and technology area experts. It provides timely information to DoD users about emerging technical innovations and pilot opportunities. DeVenCI is a catalyst initiative that does not fund the development of new technologies or businesses. Instead, it focuses on knowledge brokering by encouraging and facilitating the sharing of information to speed application of emerging technology solutions to DoD user needs.<br />Companies interested in applying for participation in this workshop should contact DeVenCI via e-mail at devenci@osd.mil for an application. Completed applications must be received on or before May 19, 2010. Selected companies will be responsible for their travel and all other expenses associated with participation in this workshop, which will be held July 14-15, 2010.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />____________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:</p>
<p>HEALTH &amp; WELFARE: $3.35 per hour or $134.00 per week or $580.66 per month</p>
<p>VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or<br />successor; 3 weeks after 5 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years. Length of service<br />includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or<br />successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the<br />performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)</p>
<p>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther<br />King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor<br />Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A<br />contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in<br />accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4174)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:</p>
<p>1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does<br />not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,<br />administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because<br />most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate<br />not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per<br />week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.<br />400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations<br />within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not<br />list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey<br />data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds<br />$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For<br />example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties<br />within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer<br />occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,<br />then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the<br />conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage<br />determination.</p>
<p>Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer<br />industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer<br />professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees<br />who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<br />(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including<br />consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional<br />specifications;<br />(2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or<br />modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and<br />related to user or system design specifications;<br />(3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer<br />programs related to machine operating systems; or<br />(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<br />requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).</p>
<p>2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY &amp; SUNDAY PAY: If you<br />work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential<br />and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.<br />If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<br />regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday<br />premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime<br />(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered<br />overtime work).</p>
<p><br />HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees<br />employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or<br />in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This<br />includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive<br />ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder<br />and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.<br />Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations<br />on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations<br />involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.</p>
<p>A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br />represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to<br />ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials<br />which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the<br />employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the<br />like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.<br />All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and<br />incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials<br />are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for<br />ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.</p>
<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<br />local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<br />employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<br />determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<br />following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<br />cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<br />the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<br />this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<br />agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<br />affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<br />and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in<br />those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"<br />materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<br />not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<br />laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<br />of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<br />there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,<br />unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A<br />links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.<br />gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at<br />http://wdol.gov/.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form<br />1444 (SF 1444)}</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<br />not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<br />be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such<br />conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the<br />fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by<br />the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)<br />of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall<br />be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}<br />When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444<br />should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be<br />conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<br />proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<br />proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage<br />rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<br />authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<br />representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the<br />contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<br />performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<br />of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage<br />and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,<br />for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<br />the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.</p>
<p>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<br />that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the<br />wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<br />determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<br />Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<br />classifications listed in the wage determination.</p>

<DESC>FA8620-06-G-4041 0015 MQ-9 Multi-Spectral Targeting System (MTS) full rate production. This is a combined solicitation/synopsis. The Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC), 703d Aeronautical Systems Group (703 AESG) intends to award a contract on a sole source basis to Raytheon - McKinney for FY10 MTS B Production and MTS-B SRU Spares for the Predator/Reaper Program. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Raytheon Space and Airborne Systems - McKinney has been identified as the only firm that possesses the necessary knowledge, experience, and technical data required to perform this effort. The Government does not own full data rights for the system; therefore to avoid duplication costs, the Government intends to award the effort pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. SEE READER'S GUIDE NUMBERED NOTE 22.
<p>This requirement was previously synopsized under FA8620-10-D-3008 for the MTS Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract. However, the Most Probable Quantities (MPQ) for MTS-B Production Systems (Qty 39) and SRU spares are being pulled from the FY10-12 IDIQ and placed under FA8620-06-G-4041 0015 as necessary to expedite proposals and timely award for the MTS B Production Systems and SRU Spares.</p>
<p>For subcontracting opportunities, interested parties may submit appropriate information to Becky Perry at 972-952-5388. The National American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement action is 336413. Please indicate number of employees relative to the size standard of 1,000 for determination of small business status. Respondees shall include their assigned DUNS number and their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code.</p>
<p>The Point of Contact for this action is 703 AESG/SYK, 703aesg.syk@wpafb.af.mil. In accordance with AFMC Clause 5352.201-9101, the ASC Ombudsman for this effort is Mr. Howard Marks, ASC/AQH, (Phone: 937-255-8642) E-Mail: howard.marks@wpafb.af.mil.</p>

<p><br />CLAUSES INCORPORATED BY FULL TEXT</p>
<p><br />52.204-7 CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (APR 2008)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. As used in this clause--</p>
<p>Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database means the primary Government repository for Contractor information required for the conduct of business with the Government.</p>
<p>Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at Subpart 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>Registered in the CCR database means that--</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, into the CCR database; and</p>
<p>(2) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and has marked the record ``Active''. The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the CCR registration process.</p>
<p>(b)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.</p>
<p>(2) The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation "DUNS" or "DUNS +4" followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the offeror's name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The DUNS number will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database.</p>
<p>(c) If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one.</p>
<p>(1) An offeror may obtain a DUNS number--</p>
<p>(i) Via the Internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the offeror does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office. The offeror should indicate that it is an offeror for a U.S. Government contract when contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>
<p>(2) The offeror should be prepared to provide the following information:</p>
<p>(i) Company legal business.</p>
<p>(ii) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized.</p>
<p>(iii) Company Physical Street Address, City, State, and Zip Code.</p>
<p>(iv) Company Mailing Address, City, State and Zip Code (if separate from physical).</p>
<p>(v) Company Telephone Number.</p>
<p>(vi) Date the company was started.</p>
<p>(vii) Number of employees at your location.</p>
<p>(viii) Chief executive officer/key manager.</p>
<p>(ix) Line of business (industry).</p>
<p>(x) Company Headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity).</p>
<p>(d) If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror.</p>
<p>(e) Processing time, which normally takes 48 hours, should be taken into consideration when registering. Offerors who are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation.</p>
<p>(f) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(g)(1)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (g)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(h) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423, or 269-961-5757.</p>

The NAICS code and small business size standard for this acquisition appear in Block 10 of the solicitation cover sheet (SF 1449).

Offers may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, offers must show--</p>

<p>(2) The time specified in the solicitation for receipt of offers;</p>
<p>(3) The name, address, and telephone number of the offeror;</p>

<p>(7) "Remit to" address, if different than mailing address;</p>

<p>(10) Past performance information, when included as an evaluation factor, to include recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items and other references (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant information); and</p>
<p>(11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.</p>
<p>(c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.</p>
<p>(d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the sender's request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.</p>
<p>(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers:</p>
<p>(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.</p>
<p>(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and--</p>
<p>(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or</p>
<p>(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or</p>
<p>(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.</p>
<p>(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.</p>
<p>(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.</p>
<p>(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.</p>
<p>(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer.</p>
<p>(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the offer.</p>

<p>(j) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number. (Applies to all offers exceeding $3,000, and offers of $3,000 or less if the solicitation requires the Contractor to be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database. The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation "DUNS" or "DUNS +4" followed by the DUNS or DUNS +4 number that identifies the offeror's name and address. The DUNS +4 is the DUNS number plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned at the discretion of the offeror to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR Subpart 32.11) for the same concern. If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. An offeror within the United States may contact Dun and Bradstreet by calling 1-866-705-5711 or via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform.

<p>(k) Central Contractor Registration. Unless exempted by an addendum to this solicitation, by submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation.

<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed.

<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims).

<DESC>Isolera One Flash Purification System.
It is the National Energy Technology Laboratory's (NETL) intent to award a purchase order on a sole source basis to Biotage for an Isolera One Automated Flash Purification System.	
This is considered a sole source to Biotage for the purchase of an Isolera One automated flash purification system with expanded fraction collector bed and variable wavelength detector.  This column flash purification system is needed for the synthesis and purification of novel materials synthesized.  The Biotage Isolera One Automated Flash Purification System with expanded fraction collector bed and variable wavelength detector is the only unit which will fulfill our needs.  The Isolera One System is a compact flash purification system with intelligent features to easily achieve better separations of organic compounds. The TLC-to-gradient feature automatically creates elution gradients and suggests cartridge and sample size.  This equipment will collect fractions using two wavelengths, adjust the flow rate from 1 to 200 mL/min as needed, and use up to four solvents in a single gradient, for maximum purity and yield.  This unit has additional useful features such as the large st integrated fraction capacity for collecting larger samples.  The Isocratic co-solvent feature increases compounds solubility and recovery.  Biotage Isolera has easy to use intuitive software allowing the scientists to create their methods easily.  Biotage SNAP cartridges allow increased loading of samples and improves compound separations.  The Isolera One System has the capability to add an auxiliary detector if needed.  The Isolera One is the only equipment available which is capable of meeting NETL's needs.  This equipment is only available from the intended sole source supplier Biotage.  No known potential alternate sources exist which could satisfy the agency's need for the equipment described herein.  Biotage is the only vendor that can supply the equipment as described.
This is not a formal solicitation.  This synopsis is not considered a Request for Quotation or Proposal.  No solicitation document is available.  All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  Challenges must demonstrate the capability to provide all necessary data elements.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL<br />ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION<br />FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.
<p>***This solicitation is being issued using Simplified Acquisition Procedures.***</p>
<p>***This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-40.***</p>
<p>*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. This requirement is a 100% Small Business Set-Aside.***</p>
<p>*** The National Institute of Standards and Technology is seeking to purchase One (1) Laser Hygrometer. ***</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) requires a laser-based hygrometer for use as a check standard for tests performed using the NIST Hybrid Humidity Generator (HHG) and as a gas purifier performance monitor for the purified air used as a diluents gas within the HHG.</p>
<p>***All interested Contractors may provide a quote for the following:</p>
<p>Line Item 0001: Quantity One (1) Laser Hygrometer, which shall meet or exceed the following minimum specifications:</p>
<p>General:</p>
<p>1. Sensing Technique - The measured water vapor concentration must be determined by laser-absorption spectroscopy, with the exception that water vapor concentrations obtained by comparison of the spectroscopic measurements of the test gas to spectroscopic measurements of a second gas source are not permissible.</p>
<p>2. Environmental Requirements - The hygrometer must be capable of operating in an environment of 20 &ordm;C &plusmn; 10 &ordm;C, with relative humidity of 50% RH +/- 20%.</p>
<p>3. Input Line Voltage Requirements - The hygrometer shall operate on 110VAC, at 60 Hz, and draw less than 5 Amperes.</p>
<p>4. Sample Gas Composition and Gas Flow Capacity - The maximum operating flow rate through the hygrometer shall be at least 1 standard liters per minute (SLM) of humidified air.</p>
<p>5. Inlet Pressure Capacity - The hygrometer must be compatible with sample gas at ambient pressure. The appropriate pump shall be supplied by the manufacturer.</p>
<p>Hygrometer Performance Specifications:</p>
<p>1. Operating Range - The operating range shall be from 20 X 10-9 (ppb) to 500 X 10-6 (ppm) of water in air. The 20 ppb value is required so that we can insure that the water vapor background in purified air diluents is within the uncertainty specifications for the HHG.</p>
<p>2. Response Time - 95% response time shall be 3 minutes or less. This requirement allows us to routinely sample the purified diluents stream at the start of calibrations requiring use of purified air.</p>
<p>3. Accuracy - Specified accuracy shall be the greater of +/- 4% of reading or +/- 10 ppb.</p>
<p>4. Stability of Zero Reading - The analyzer response to a purified gas stream shall not drift by more than 10 ppb or the analyzer's sensitivity specification, whichever is less.</p>
<p>Construction Materials and Methods:</p>
<p>1. Wetted Materials - Wetted materials within the hygrometer must be compatible with making part per billion measurements. Generally, this means that components coming in contact with the test gas should be constructed of electro-polished, passivated 316L stainless steel, with a surface finish of 10 micro-inches RA (roughness average) or smoother.</p>
<p>2. Use of Elastomers / Elastomeric Seals - No elastomers or elastomeric seals may be used in any way that contacts the test gas stream upstream of and including the sampling cell, including applications in which the elastomer does not directly contact the gas stream, but whose proximity to the stream might create a water vapor concentration gradient that could contribute water vapor to the test gas stream, as in face-sealing applications.</p>
<p>The following specification is a brand name (Swagelok) or equal. Brand name or equal is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive, and is to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that will be considered satisfactory to meet the agency requirement.</p>
<p>3. Gas Connections and Tubing Fittings - All gas connections and tubing end fittings shall be &frac14; inch diameter Swagelok VCR connections or equivalent, which shall meet the following salient characteristic: Metal Face-Seal Fittings. All fittings shall possess electro-polished and passivated interior surfaces as specified above.</p>
<p>4. Welding - Tubing runs shall be orbital welded, consistent with current high-purity practices employed by the semiconductor processing industry.</p>
<p>5. Leak Rate of Assembled Components - The maximum allowable leak rate is 2 x 10-8 mbar - liter/sec.</p>
<p>Data Handling / Storage / Outputs:</p>
<p>1. Data Display - The output graphical display shall be scalable by the user.</p>
<p>2. Analog Outputs - Analog outputs shall be supplied for each gas input channel. Acceptable outputs are 0 to 10 VDC, 4-20 mA, or 0-20 mA. The outputs shall be scalable with a minimum range corresponding to a water vapor concentration from 0 ppb to 500 ppm.</p>
<p>3. Data Transfer Capability - The hygrometer shall be provided with either a serial port interface or IEEE-488 interface for data transfer.</p>
<p>Delivery terms shall be FOB Destination. FOB Destination means: The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery. The contractor shall deliver line item 0001 to NIST, Building 301, Shipping and Receiving, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-1640.</p>

The Government will evaluate information based on the following evaluation criteria: 1) Technical Capability factor "Meeting or Exceeding the Minimum Specifications," 2) Past Performance and 3) Price.</p>
<p>Technical capability and past performance, when combined, are more important than price. Technical Capability is more important than Past Performance. The importance of price in the evaluation will increase with the degree of equality among quotations of the non-price factors.</p>
<p>Technical Capability:</p>
<p>Evaluation of Technical Capability will be based on the information provided in the quotation. Quoters shall include the manufacturer or brand name, make and model of the products, manufacturer sales literature or other product literature that addresses all technical requirements, and that clearly documents that the offered product meets technical requirements stated above.</p>
<p>Past Performance:</p>
<p>Past Performance will be evaluated to determine the overall quality of the product &amp; service provided and the Contractors history of meeting delivery schedules for prior deliverables.</p>
<p>Evaluation of Past Performance shall be based on the references provided and/or the quoters recent and relevant procurement history with NIST or its affiliates.

<p>The proposed Basic Ordering Agreement is included in this notice.<br />A basic ordering agreement is not a contract.<br />Each order issued shall be subject to the contract clauses, provisions, certifications, terms, conditions and pricing of the BOA.</p>
<p>Firms issued a BOA may receive requests for technical and/or price proposals leading to award of orders. Issuance of Basic Ordering Agreements will be based on evaluation of qualifications in accordance with the criteria as set forth below. Award of specific orders as requirements arise will be based on price and other factors as deemed desirable and set forth for each specific requirement. Specific firm fixed price orders will be competed among those firms issued a BOA. The Government, in its sole discretion, will determine which, and how many, of the firms holding BOA's will be requested to submit price and technical proposals for requirements leading to firm fixed price orders. The approximate range in value of orders is expected to be $650.00 to $650,000.00 (Euro 500.00 to Euro 515,000.00). The foreseen average number of orders per year is 19 for an approximate aggregate value of $1,033,000.00 (Euro 860,453).</p>
<p>Under this Painting and Coating program, firms selected for a BOA will compete on task orders for requirements. If adequate competition cannot be obtained, the Government reserves the right to open the area of competition to include non BOA holders.

Repair of plaster or other damaged surfaces or associated work to render surfaces suitable to receive coatings is also included. There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount or volume of work that will be ordered under the agreement.</p>
<p>Government funds are obligated only to the extent that a duly issued order creates such obligation.</p>
<p>Pricing: In order to provide maximum flexibility for market conditions, economies of scale and quantity considerations etc. firms will be required to submit Not to Exceed unit prices for each of the anticipated 5 year duration of the BOA. Each order under the BOA shall be on a Firm Fixed Price basis. The order proposal cannot be based on prices that exceed the ceiling price for the applicable period.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer will open/advertise the BOA program through the Federal Business Opportunities website (http://www.fbo.gov) for new entrants once a year or at intervals that will guarantee adequate competition for this specific coating program. The BOA can only be changed by modification of the agreement itself and not by individual orders issued hereunder. Modification of the BOA shall not retroactively affect orders issued prior to the time of the modification. A BOA may be cancelled by either party by mailing or otherwise transmitting 30 days prior written notice to the other party. Any such cancellation shall have no effect on any orders issued prior to the effective date of the cancellation, which shall be 30 days from the date of mailing or otherwise transmitting the written notice of cancellation. Prior to the effective date of cancellation, the 31st Contracting squadron may continue to place orders under the BOA.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

ALL QUOTED ITEMS MUST BE BRAND NAME SPECIFIED.  PARTIAL QUOTES WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.  COMPARABLE ITEMS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED 
This combined synopsis/solicitation incorporates the provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-27. This is a 100% small-business set-aside. The NAICS Code for this requirement is 335911 with a size standard of 500 emp.
The contract resulting from this combined synopsis, solicitation, will be a firm-fixed price contract. 
DELIVERY/SHIPPING INSTRUCTIONS: Prices shall be FOB destination, delivery to Mountain Warfare Training Center (MWTC) ATTN: Motor Transport  HC 83, Box 1 BLDG 7047 Bridgeport, CA 93517-5009. Required delivery date is no later than 30 June 2010. 
PACKAGING REQUIREMENTS: Preservation and Packaging shall be best commercial practice, sufficient to protect and preserve all items supplied under this contract during shipping to destination.
EVALUATION PROCEDURES/BASIS FOR AWARD The Government intends to award a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) contract using FAR 15.101-2, Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA). Only one (1) award may be made to the responsible quoter(s) who:1) quotes the brand name items specified in the combined synopsis/solicitation, conforming to the delivery requirement and; 2) quotes the lowest evaluated price. Information submitted by the offeror must be suficient to establish that the quoter is proposing the brand name items specified above. Quoters are  required to submit quotations for all CLINs. The Government intends to evaluate quotations and award a contract without discussions with quoters. Quotations should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.
Quoters are encouraged to use Standard Form 1449, Solicitation/Contract/ Order for Commercial Items form found at http://www.gsa.gov/forms/pdf_file and submit a proposal. All qualified responsible small business sources may submit a quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES. Quotations received without the completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3 may be considered non-compliant. Beginning January 1, 2005, the FAR requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. ORCA also allows Government personnel to access your information online, thus eliminating the need for you to submit representations and certifications with each offer. To register in ORCA you will need an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company's ID and password into ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status. Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCA's homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov/help.aspx. Full text of FAR and DFARS provisions and clauses may be accessed at http://www.farsite.hill.af.mil/vffara.htm and http://farsite.hill.af.mil/VFDFARA.HTM, respectively.

Only one (1) award may be made to the responsible quoter(s) who:1) quotes the brand name items specified in the combined synopsis/solicitation, conforming to the delivery requirement and; 2) quotes the lowest evaluated price. Information submitted by the offeror must be suficient to establish that the quoter is proposing the brand name items specified above. Quoters are  required to submit quotations for all CLINs. The Government intends to evaluate quotations and award a contract without discussions with quoters. Quotations should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary.
Quoters are encouraged to use Standard Form 1449, Solicitation/Contract/ Order for Commercial Items form found at http://www.gsa.gov/forms/pdf_file and submit a proposal. All qualified responsible small business sources may submit a quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES. Quotations received without the completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3 may be considered non-compliant. Beginning January 1, 2005, the FAR requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. ORCA also allows Government personnel to access your information online, thus eliminating the need for you to submit representations and certifications with each offer. To register in ORCA you will need an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company's ID and password into ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status. Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCA's homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov/help.aspx. Full text of FAR and DFARS provisions and clauses may be accessed at http://www.farsite.hill.af.mil/vffara.htm and http://farsite.hill.af.mil/VFDFARA.HTM, respectively.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation and Notice of Intent. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate on a sole source basis with Green Hat, LLC for a software license and maintenance for the Green Hat Tester software under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. This will be in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, as applicable, and as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Submit offers on HTC711-10-Q-D020. The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-40, dated 22 April 2010. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 511210 and the small business size is $25M.
<p>Green Hat, LLC is the only known supplier of Green Hat Tester (GH Tester) software and maintenance as required by the AT21 Program Management Office of USTRANSCOM. The GH Tester software is a proprietary product of Green Hat, LLC. There are similar products available through other companies but do not meet the range of testing capabilites provided by GH Tester. GH Tester is an integrated testing product that provides the capability to automatically test Services Oriented Architecture (SOA) services and generate test reports and support documentation with the same tool. Other testing products do not meet this requirement. GH Tester offers integrated testing unique to this manufacturer. Using a different method or product to test the SOA capabilities would require that USTRANSCOM purchase multiple tools to achieve the integrated capability offered by GH Tester. Based on the market research, no company other than Green Hat, LLC can provide the necessary software products for the requirement. AT21 PMO provided Justification and Approval (J&amp;A) stating that procurement of other products would complicate testing efforts because testing of processes and services could not be performed in an integrated environment. This increased risk may cause longer testing cycles and introduce schedule delays. A sole source purchase is recommended in order to fulfill this mission requirement. This action will not be open for competition as GH Tester is a proprietary product of Green Hat, LLC . FOB Point shall be Destination, Scott AFB, IL. Delivery location is USTRANSCOM, TCJ6-PE, 508 Scott Drive, Scott AFB, IL 62225.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is state that a revised SOW was posted 4 May and to answer questions from vendors,&nbsp;all questions and answers are posted below: <br /><br />Questions And Answers
<p>Q1. Would you please confirm what material is under the risers? Is it &frac34;" plywood? <br />A1. The material is a single sheet of 3/4" plywood.</p>
<p>Q2. Does it have more than one layer of the plywood?<br />A2. Material is a single sheet</p>
<p>Q3. Will the AFB require new plywood to be laid down?<br />A3. New plywood is not required; however the chairs need to be secure on the floor. If patch work is needed to secure the new chairs to the plywood then it will become the contractor's responsibility.</p>
<p>Q4. Specified part #X465JRY77 does not come with a moveable tablet, Secondly; the spec does not specify a fabric. Thirdly, the base of the chair does not look like a chair for an auditorium.<br />A4. After review of the part number given by the government it has been determined that the part number specified will not meet the government's needs for auditorium seating. The P/N in the SOW will be replaced with Lancaster Auditorium Seating or equal. No part number is available per manufacturer. Style: Management Seat and Back (Grade 3 solid color fabric, tan, blue, or maroon). Plastic ends, backs and arm covers, with optional tablet arm. Revised Statement of work has been posted.</p>
<p>Q5. At the prebid it was implied that the government wants chairs comparable to the ones they already have, yet more durable to last a bit longer than before. This widens the range of the price of a chair considerably. In order to provide a quality chair, yet still keep the bidding at a fair advantage for each bidder; will a price allowance be set for the cost of the chairs?<br />A5. No, A price allowance will not be set. Please refer to Lancaster Auditorium Seating (or equal product) in previous question or revised statement work.</p>
<p>Q6. How close can our supplier get the truck/dumpster to the building? <br />A6. We should be able to get a dumpster/truck within 50 feet of the<br />Building.</p>
<p>Q7. Do we have access to both set of stairs - front of the bldg and the<br />side of the bldg - for the deliveries and disposal?<br />A7. All three entrances will be available. (2 ends and one middle)</p>
<p><br />Q8. Where and what size would the inside laydown area be for this<br />project? <br />A8. Laydown area unknown</p>

<DESC>Amendment #02<BR>Questions and Answers to W911RZ-10-T-0152 Move Trailers<BR><BR>Question:  Who will remove A/C unit from the roof?<BR>Answer:  The contractor shall be responsible for disconnecting the rooftop A/C unit, transporting to Turkey Creek and reconnecting it.<BR><BR>Question:  Who will disconnect and reconnect porch?<BR>Answer:  The contractor shall disconnect existing porch and turn it in to a Government representative at PCMS.<BR><BR>Question:  When trailer is separated, dividing wall will need to be removed; there appears to be utilities in this wall. Who will handle removal and reinstallation of this wall and all it contains?<BR>Answer:  The contractor shall be responsible for removal of dividing wall and reconnection of all interior utilities at Turkey Creek.<BR><BR>Question:  When trailer is separated, the interior ceiling trim may not hold up. Who will be responsible for replacement of interior ceiling trim, should it break upon removal?  Who will be responsible for removal and reinstallation of carpet in order for unit to be separated?<BR>Answer:  The moving contractor will be responsible for ceiling trim and carpet.  The intent is to reuse the existing carpet so every effort should be made to cut the carpet at the mate line so that it can be re-seamed at Turkey Creek. If there is not a seam at the mate line the contractor that is moving the trailer will have to cut the carpet with a utility knife or carpet cutting knife at the mate line (where the trailer comes apart into the two halves).  Once the trailer is placed on the foundation at Turkey Creek and the two halves are mated back together the moving contractor will need to re-seam the carpet back together where they previously cut it.  <BR><BR>Question:  Can this solicitation not be delayed until May 6 in order that we may perform a site visit?<BR>Answer:  Due to Pinon Canyon Maneuver Sites security and the urgency of this requirement, a formal site visit will not be held. <BR><BR>The quote due date has been extended to 12:00p.m. Mountain Time on 06 May 2010.<BR>

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  Price and Technical.  Technical is significantly less important than price.  (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).  (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.  <BR><BR>The Government intends to evaluate quotes and award one contract without discussions with Offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a)).

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items/services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number H92257-10-Q-0013 is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 200540 and DFARS Change Notice DCN 20100408. The proposed acquisition is restricted to small business. The associated NAICS code is 611699 with a standard business size of $7.0 million. A Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract is contemplated. Marine Corps Special Operations Command, Camp Lejeune North Carolina, has a one-time requirement to procure: 

CLIN 0001: Technical Support Services

Offers shall depict each labor category, quantity per category, and hourly rate/daily required to provide the requested services. Technical support services that are classified as open market services in lieu of GSA services shall be clearly identified. All work will be done in accordance with the Statement of Work (SOW) attached.

CLIN 0002: Other Direct Cost (ODC)

Includes material, supplies, fuel, mileage, per diem, lodging and airfare. Travel shall be in accordance with the joint travel regulations (JTR). Contractor shall be required red to provide receipts. ODCs that are classified as open market in lieu of GSA shall be clearly identified. All work will be done in accordance with the Statement of Work (SOW) attached.

Delivery: Period of performance will begin May 31, 2010 and end no later than June 11, 2010.

The Government anticipates award of a Firm Fixed Price contract. The evaluation factors for this RFQ are price, technical (technical approach, understanding the requirement, technical plan/methodology), delivery date, relevant (similar services provided within the past three years) and satisfactory past performance, and price.  Categorically, evaluation factors will be weighed in this order of precedence; technical, delivery date, and past performance. The Government intends to make award based on lowest price technically acceptable. 

Standard Lowest Price Technically Acceptable Language

-	Use of LPTA is required by AI 13.106-100.
-	LPTA may not be appropriate for use where high quality is required and that factor can not otherwise be reduced to an acceptable/non-acceptable factor under an LPTA analysis (i.e. it is generally appropriate for simple products or services).

52.212-2 Evaluation  Commercial Items. (select appropriate bold language below)

a.  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  For this solicitation, the most advantageous offer for the government will be the responsible, lowest-priced, technically acceptable offeror considering the following factors:

[Choose from among the following factors; choose fewer if acquisition is for a simple product or service and we need to award quickly; the following list is not all-inclusive.]

1. Price; [mandatory]
2. Delivery; 
3. Technical; 
4. Past Performance; [Past performance is only valuable if we get relevant and recent past performance information.  This must be explained to vendors  e.g. Submit past performance references from three or more customers for projects /services performed within the last three years that were for the same or similar items or services described in this solicitation.  We can consider a shorter period of time if there are numerous actions or many vendors providing the required items.  If a contractor has no experience then you don't hold that against them - they receive a neutral rating which is acceptable.  They are not acceptable if they have had negative past performance.  Personal knowledge of the contracting officer MAY be considered.]
5.  Experience; [Similar to past performance but a distinct factor; it represents the experience they have in the industry, and not necessarily how they have performed on previous contracts; the solicitation should say what minimum level experience is required IOT be acceptable, e.g., 3 yrs direct or related experience.] 
6.  Management/Personnel; [If this is a factor we want to consider, the solicitation must list the requirements for management or personnel so that the offer will know what is acceptable.] 

Proposals will be evaluated in an efficient and minimally burdensome fashion.  The offeror must be acceptable in all factors listed to be considered technically acceptable.  The Government will then make award to the lowest priced of the technically acceptable vendors. 

OR
 
Proposals will be evaluated in an efficient and minimally burdensome fashion.  The offeror must be acceptable in all factors listed to be considered technically acceptable.  The Government will select the vendor whose quote is the lowest price of the technically acceptable quotes in order to negotiate details.  If agreement can not be reached with that vendor, the Government will move on to the next lowest priced, technically acceptable vendor.   

[If applicable, add the following]  While not a factor for determination of technical acceptability, contractors are reminded that this solicitation contains (DFARS 252.225-7024, Requirement for Products or Services from Iraq or Afghanistan) OR (DFARS 252.225-7026, Acquisition Restricted to Products or Services from Iraq or Afghanistan).  In order to receive consideration for award under this solicitation, offerors must comply with this clause.  

b. Options  use appropriate language from 52.212-2

c. Remainder of 52.212-2

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number H92257-10-Q-0013 is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 200540 and DFARS Change Notice DCN 20100408. The proposed acquisition is restricted to small business. The associated NAICS code is 611699 with a standard business size of $7.0 million. A Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract is contemplated. Marine Corps Special Operations Command, Camp Lejeune North Carolina, has a one-time requirement to procure: 

CLIN 0001: Technical Support Services

Offers shall depict each labor category, quantity per category, and hourly rate/daily required to provide the requested services. Technical support services that are classified as open market services in lieu of GSA services shall be clearly identified. All work will be done in accordance with the Statement of Work (SOW) attached.

Delivery: Period of performance will begin May 31, 2010 and end no later than June 11, 2010.

The Government anticipates award of a Firm Fixed Price contract. The evaluation factors for this RFQ are price, technical (technical approach, understanding the requirement, technical plan/methodology), delivery date, relevant (similar services provided within the past three years) and satisfactory past performance, and price.  Categorically, evaluation factors will be weighed in this order of precedence; technical, delivery date, and past performance. The Government intends to make award based on lowest price technically acceptable. 

Standard Lowest Price Technically Acceptable Language

-	Use of LPTA is required by AI 13.106-100.
-	LPTA may not be appropriate for use where high quality is required and that factor can not otherwise be reduced to an acceptable/non-acceptable factor under an LPTA analysis (i.e. it is generally appropriate for simple products or services).

52.212-2 Evaluation  Commercial Items. (select appropriate bold language below)

a.  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  For this solicitation, the most advantageous offer for the government will be the responsible, lowest-priced, technically acceptable offeror considering the following factors:

[Choose from among the following factors; choose fewer if acquisition is for a simple product or service and we need to award quickly; the following list is not all-inclusive.]

1. Price; [mandatory]
2. Delivery; 
3. Technical; 
4. Past Performance; [Past performance is only valuable if we get relevant and recent past performance information.  This must be explained to vendors  e.g. Submit past performance references from three or more customers for projects /services performed within the last three years that were for the same or similar items or services described in this solicitation.  We can consider a shorter period of time if there are numerous actions or many vendors providing the required items.  If a contractor has no experience then you don't hold that against them - they receive a neutral rating which is acceptable.  They are not acceptable if they have had negative past performance.  Personal knowledge of the contracting officer MAY be considered.]
5.  Experience; [Similar to past performance but a distinct factor; it represents the experience they have in the industry, and not necessarily how they have performed on previous contracts; the solicitation should say what minimum level experience is required IOT be acceptable, e.g., 3 yrs direct or related experience.] 
6.  Management/Personnel; [If this is a factor we want to consider, the solicitation must list the requirements for management or personnel so that the offer will know what is acceptable.] 

Proposals will be evaluated in an efficient and minimally burdensome fashion.  The offeror must be acceptable in all factors listed to be considered technically acceptable.  The Government will then make award to the lowest priced of the technically acceptable vendors. 

OR
 
Proposals will be evaluated in an efficient and minimally burdensome fashion.  The offeror must be acceptable in all factors listed to be considered technically acceptable.  The Government will select the vendor whose quote is the lowest price of the technically acceptable quotes in order to negotiate details.  If agreement can not be reached with that vendor, the Government will move on to the next lowest priced, technically acceptable vendor.   

[If applicable, add the following]  While not a factor for determination of technical acceptability, contractors are reminded that this solicitation contains (DFARS 252.225-7024, Requirement for Products or Services from Iraq or Afghanistan) OR (DFARS 252.225-7026, Acquisition Restricted to Products or Services from Iraq or Afghanistan).  In order to receive consideration for award under this solicitation, offerors must comply with this clause.  

b. Options  use appropriate language from 52.212-2

<DESC>This project is NOT currently funded with ARRA funds. 

This project will be advertised on an unrestricted (full and open) basis. 

PROJECT DETAILS: The Beartooth Highway in Wyoming begins at the Wyoming/Montana State Line east of Cooke City, Montana, following US 212 for 56.1 kilometers to the Wyoming/Montana State Line southwest of Red Lodge, Montana. The project is located entirely within the Shoshone National Forest. The project begins at approximately Mile Post 26 immediately west of Beartooth Lake Outlet Bridge, and ends at approximately Mile Post 27.7 immediately west of Little Bear Creek. The project is located in remote, environmentally sensitive high alpine terrain (in excess of 9,000 feet) with a very limited construction season (4 to 5 months per year), and must be completed in 2011. Considerable attention to detail is required in project construction due the historical eligibility of the existing roadway and bridges. 

The base schedule, Schedule A, for this project consists of the removal of the existing Beartooth Lake Outlet Bridge, and reconstructing a new structure, with approaches totaling 0.4 mile, immediately adjacent to, and partially over, the existing bridge. The existing bridge can be partially used for maintenance of traffic, and is required to be deconstructed in an extremely careful manner in order to preserve the existing stone masonry for reuse on the new structure, and limit turbidity in Beartooth Creek. Schedule A will also contain the construction of a historic bridge interpretive site, parking area, and access trail, as well as reconstruction of the Beartooth Lake Campground approach road intersection. The principal work items on the base schedule include: lump sum contractor testing, lump sum construction schedule, 3,500 m3 roadway excavation, 7,700 m3 unclassified borrow, 6,000 t aggregate base, 1,350 t superpave pavement, 124 m precast, prestressed concrete girders, 46,750 kg reinforcing steel - epoxy coated, 260 m3 structural concrete, 830 m micropiles, 2 trial micropiles, 131 m of Guardrail system G3 - Wyoming box beam steel posts, along with associated traffic control and equipment/flagging, soil erosion control, survey and staking, pavement markings.

There are two optional schedules: (1) Option V  pre-grubbing removal of stumps, seeding and mulching, and erosion control, along a 1.2 mile extension of the eastern bridge approach; (2) Option W  grade, drain, and pave 1.2 miles of roadway predominately along the existing alignment east of the Beartooth Lake Campground approach intersection. 

Principal work items on Option V include: 200 hours each of Dump Truck, Bulldozer, Excavator, and Labor for stump removal, 4.0 ha seeding, 4.0 ha mulching, 2,400 m silt fence, and associated traffic control equipment/flagging, seeding, and mulching.

Principal work items on Option W include: lump sum contractor testing, lump sum construction schedule, 27,500 m3 roadway excavation, 5,100 m3 unclassified borrow, 14,000 t aggregate base, 3,650 t superpave pavement, 1,450 m asphalt curb, 450 m of guardrail system G4 (w-beam steel posts), 5.4 ha seeding, 4.6 ha mulching, along with associated traffic control and equipment/flagging, soil erosion control, survey and staking, pavement markings.

It is anticipated that this project will be advertised in early May with construction beginning in 2010 and extending up to two construction seasons.

Estimated cost for the base schedule and both options is $5 - $10 million.

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis/RFI entitled HEAVY LAUNCH AND PROPULSIONTECHNOLOGY Request for Information (RFI) (Reference Number:  RFI05042010PS40 which wasposted on May 4, 2010]. Due to an error made at posting the RFI is hereby revised asfollows:Heavy Lift Launch System and Propulsion TechnologyRequest for Information (RFI)I. Background/ObjectiveNASA has requirements for heavy lift launch to extend human and robotic presencethroughout the solar system. NASA desires to enable exploration of multiple potentialdestinations, including the Moon, asteroids, Lagrange points, and Mars and its environsin the most cost effective and safe manner.NASA is in the planning phase to develop strategies for enabling a heavy lift launchsystem. At the same time, NASA desires to develop liquid chemical propulsion technologiesto support a more affordable and robust space transportation industry.This approach will strengthen Americas space industry, and could provide a catalyst forfuture business ventures to capitalize on affordable access to space. It will alsoleverage a broader range of American ingenuity to keep our nation onthe leading edge of human space exploration capabilities.II. Market ResearchIndustry involvement early in the development phase is essential for NASA to formulate astrategy to meet the national objectives of enabling heavy lift systems and developingpropulsion technologies that are both affordable and used bymultiple customers. Any resulting acquisition approach will utilize these guidingprinciples:a. Focus on affordability and low development and recurring costsb. Maximize competitionc. Satisfy multiple users inside and outside of NASAd. Apply the appropriate set of performance measures and incentives.e. Leverage existing industry programs.f. Review all requirements from a zero-based approach.g. Maximize the use of small businessesIII. InputsUsing the information above with the overall goal is to provide heavy lift systems andpropulsion technologies that are both safe and affordable and will serve multiplecustomers. NASA is inviting industry, academia, Internationals and other non-Governmentresearch organizations to provide inputs in the following specific areas:1. Propulsion Systemsa. Provide information regarding your potential launch or spacetransportation architectures (expendable, reusable, or a hybrid system) that could meetmultiple customer needs (e.g., NASA, DoD, and Commercial). Describe potential referencemissions. Describe the engine or engines required to meet your requirements to includethose for different stages and potential in-space utilization. Outline known developmentefforts and technology insertion; sharing of information, sharing of facilities; etc.b. For vehicle providers, provide your top-level requirements including: operability andaffordability (low life cycle cost); safety (minimize catastrophic failures, loss ofvehicle, etc.), and performance (thrust, ISP, throttle range if any, mass to LEO/GTO,etc.), both current and future upgrade plans. Provide rationale as to how theserequirements were derived.c. Identify strategies to lower propulsion system costs and improve operability includingoverhead; improved manufacturing processes; lower staffing; and elimination/tailoring ofspecific Government requirements.d. Describe methods to effectively manage to a lower per production unit cost (forexample, lot buys, design to cost, cost incentive structures, non-traditional businessarrangements, anticipated business, sensitivity to business base, etc.).e. Describe how you would leverage any existing efforts to include hardware, designs,analysis, and facilities to save cost and accelerate schedules.f. Describe potential acquisition strategies for enabling development of large propulsionsystems and pros and cons of the strategies.2. Basic Propulsion Researcha. Provide general areas where you believe gaps exist in liquid chemical propulsiontechnologies that could lead to breakthroughs in mission affordability and capability.Liquid chemical propulsion technologies include discipline-focused research into suchthings as materials, manufacturing, combustion processes, propellant chemistry, and otherpropulsion system elements (such as tanks, valves, feed lines, and health management).Identify strategies for insertion of these technologies in new propulsion systems andalso how to make them available to the Industry for multiple applications.b. Describe methods to effectively manage the strategies for technology insertions,including non-traditional business arrangements.c. Identify how you would plan to bring existing mid-level Technology Readiness Levels(TRLs) to operational levels at an affordable cost through test programs, grounddemonstrations, and flight demonstrations.d. Describe how you would envision working with multiple customers (including DoD, NASA,and commercial) to identify top priority technologies and their associated payoffs.e. Describe approaches for utilizing the unique capabilities of our nations colleges anduniversities in addressing technology gaps, including identification of gaps theseacademic institutions may be uniquely qualified to address. Discussion may include avision for the development of the next generation of scientists and engineers in thespace launch propulsionarena through outreach, partnerships, and direct involvement in the technology program.f. Describe how you would leverage any existing efforts to include hardware, designs,analysis, and facilities to save cost and accelerate schedule. Identify any existingassets in which you require or obtain benefit to support the technology maturation in atimely, affordable, and efficientmanner.3. Program and Business ManagementNASA is seeking Industry inputs into methods to manage these programs to includeeffective and affordable business practices.a. Describe processes for the overall management of the program to most effectivelydevelop propulsion systems and technologies.b. How would you propose to participate in systems analysis andassessments?c. How would you propose to serve in an advisory capacity for the program providing inputon content and objectives and evaluation of performance and results?d. Identify barriers to competition and mitigation strategies.e. Discuss procurement approaches to include alternative businessarrangements.f. Discuss effective methods of utilizing international partnerships while maintainingappropriate safeguards for U.S. developed technologies.g. Recommend process improvements and efficiencies, both in theacquisition phase as well as the performance phase, along withidentification of non-value added steps and requirements.IV. SummaryThe information obtained will be used by NASA for planning and acquisition strategydevelopment. NASA will use the information obtained as a result of this RFI on anon-attribution basis. Providing data and information that is limited orrestricted for use by NASA for that purpose would be of very little value and suchrestricted/limited data/information is not solicited. No information or questionsreceived will be posted to any website or public access location. NASA does notplan to respond to the individual responses, but will provide an update to developmentand acquisition plans.This RFI is being used to obtain information for planning purposes only. The Governmentdoes not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for theinformation solicited. As stipulated in FAR 15.201(e),responses to this notice are not considered offers, shall not be used as a proposal, andcannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.

<DESC>The mission of the Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP), DCTD, NCI centers on the discovery and preclinical development of agents with clinical anticancer potential. Preclinical pharmacokinetic and metabolism studies are an early and integral part of the overall drug development process and contract resources for preclinical development studies have existed in DTP continuously since the late 1970s. Characterization of the pharmacokinetics of new compounds provides important information for the selection of optimal drug development candidates and for the design and interpretation of preclinical efficacy studies, including the selection of formulations, routes, and schedules of administration. Moreover, one objective of preclinical toxicology evaluations is the correlation of toxic effects of a compound with plasma concentrations and/or area under the curve (AUC). The successful outcome of these studies thus depends heavily on the availability of sensitive methods for quantifying compounds in biological fluids and the careful integration of preclinical pharmacology and toxicology data.<br /><br /><br />Project Requirements<br /><br />Activities of any contract awarded from the proposed solicitation will include, but not be limited to, the following tasks:
<p>(1) Development of sensitive analytical methods to quantify compounds in plasma, urine, tissues, and other biological matrices;</p>
<p>(2) Plasma stability and protein binding studies, which are conducted at an early stage of compound development to ensure proper sample handling and to aid in the interpretation of in vivo studies;</p>
<p>(3) Pharmacokinetic evaluation of test compounds following administration to animals by various routes and schedules, including a determination of bioavailability by various routes;</p>
<p>(4) Quantification and identification of drug metabolites generated in vivo and in various in vitro systems (S9 fractions,<br /><br /><br />Anticipated Period of Performance</p>
<p>The anticipated period of performance will consist of five (5) years, from December 15, 2010 through December 14, 2015.</p>

<DESC>AIRCRAFT LEASING / AIR CHARTER<BR>The U.S. Marshals Service, Justice Prisoner and Alien Transportation System (USMS-JPATS) is hereby soliciting potential sources, capabilities, and ideas, in connection with a potential JPATS requirement to fulfill its prisoner/detainee aircraft transportation mission.  JPATS operates a fleet of large transport aircraft to transport prisoners and criminal aliens throughout the United States and to selected countries in Latin America.  The aircraft are operated and maintained to the standards of Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) Part 91 and are based at three locations Oklahoma City, OK; Alexandria, LA; and Mesa, AZ.  
This is a market survey/sources sought for informational purposes only, and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal.  Currently, there is no solicitation document available; no reimbursement will be made for costs associated with responding to this announcement; and no telephone calls about this announcement will be accepted or acknowledged.  All responses must be submitted via e-mail to Arlene Dee Carlson, Contracting Officer, at arlene.carlson@usdoj.gov by 12:00 pm (noon) EST May 11, 2010.  
JPATS is soliciting interest and ideas in connection with how JPATS might best meet its mission utilizing six mid-life to late model aircraft to service all three locations whether it be through one contract covering all three areas or two or three separate contracts (one covering Oklahoma City and either one or two covering both Alexandria and Mesa).  Each location is currently serviced by two (2) MD-83 aircraft.  Any new prospective JPATS requirement would require the contractor to provide only aircraft of a U.S. Registry with a valid FAA issued Standard Certificate of Airworthiness with passenger seating capacity of not less than 156.  Any prospective JPATS requirement would most likely necessitate this general range and payload or greater.
JPATS is interested in considering all available options to meet its requirements, including dry leasing, wet leasing, or a combination of wet and dry leases of aircraft.  Other specific information of interest is as follows:
The type of large aircraft the source has available for a dry lease;
The type of large aircraft the source has available for a wet lease;
Whether a standardized fleet of six to eight aircraft in either a dry or wet lease scenario is feasible;
Whether eliminating a requirement for a standardized fleet for dry lease purposes would have an impact on estimated pricing, and if so how;
The significance, if any, in terms of estimated pricing (per flight hour and monthly), interest, capability, etc., from the source's perspective if JPATS were to break out any potential requirement to be encompassed in three different contracts covering the three locations (Oklahoma City, Alexandria, Mesa) with approximately two aircraft for each location;
If the source would have the capability/interest in proposing a mixture of dry lease and wet lease aircraft and if so, how such a arrangement could potentially operate and whether it would be advantageous with explanations behind such rationale;
The estimated pricing on a flight per hour basis and monthly basis per aircraft in a dry lease arrangement, a wet lease arrangement, and/or a mixture of both; 
If the available aircraft (both wet and dry), the timing of when it would be available and, with a wet lease, if and when the vendor would want the aircraft to be unavailable;	The current plans, if any, that a source might have for acquiring additional aircraft and if so, what type of aircraft and whether such fact would have an impact in a sources interest in a possible JPATS requirement;
The significance, if any, in terms of estimated pricing (both flight per hour and monthly), interest, capability, willingness to engage in dry leases or wet leases, etc., from the sources perspective if JPATS were to formulate a requirement to cover a multi-year base requirement on the contract (e.g. 2 to 5 years) as opposed to one base year, both with successive options;
The detailed capabilities and ability to provide maintenance support for the aircraft fleet and the impact, if any, in maintenance if three separate requirements (covering approximately two aircraft each) for each JPATS location was created as opposed to one requirement for all three JPATS locations;
Are there provisions in the current long-term lease that made it less attractive;
The level of interest in this potential requirement; and	Any other information or data that JPATS should know about in connection with a particular companys capabilities or requirements as it considers what next steps, if any, JPATS should take in formulating a potential future requirement.

<DESC><strong>Question:</strong>&nbsp; I am&nbsp;cleared to the appropriate level and we have the appropriate DoD Facilities Clearance, however neither I nor anyone in our company has a courier badge. Will a courier authorization letter from our Security Officer suffice? If so, what would you need to see in the letter?<br /><br /><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; A one time courier authorization letter will be acceptable to pick up the solicitation package. The letter must be on company letterhead and state the name of the courier, the classification level to which the courier may carry, and that the courier has been briefed on courier responsibilities. The courier authorization letter must be signed by the company's Security Officer.&nbsp; It is suggested to send a copy of the courier letter to <a href="mailto:Emily.Weir@dia.mil">Emily.Weir@dia.mil</a> for approval by a Government Security Officer.<br /><br /><strong>Question:</strong>&nbsp; [W]hat is meant by a small business sub-contracting plan? Since the size standard is $7.0 million, wouldn't the "Prime" be a small business? Are you suggesting by a the term "small business sub-contracting plan" adding more small businesses or bringing large businesses onto a team?<br /><br /><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp; A small business sub-contracting plan is needed for the proposal submission for businesses classified as&nbsp;an other than small business, not the eligibility statement submission.&nbsp; This requirement is full and open completion, not a small business set-aside.&nbsp;

<DESC>The purpose of this task order is to conduct activities to establish Specialized Cancer Registries to enhance data collected through a subset of population based central cancer registries for comparative effectiveness research. Activities include data collection, methodological development and pilot testing activities with the goal of enhancing cancer registry data for clinical follow-up. Outcomes will include a data set to be used for comparative effectiveness and other research. This data set will provide a unique set of data items in a single data set. Data from these funded activities will be made available for researchers through an established National Center for Health Statistics Research Data Center (RDC). The use of the RDC will allow CDC to protect the data as required by state laws authorizing the collection of cancer diagnoses and treatment data and CDC's Assurance of Confidentiality; and protect the confidentiality of patients whose data are included in the data set. It is anticipated that updates to the data will also be available through the RDC. American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) terms, conditions and reporting will be applicable to the work under this project.

THIS IN NOT A SOLICITATION OR BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, IT IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.
The Department of Energy awarded a Time and Materials Recovery Act task assignment extension under an existing competitively award General Services Administration Federal Supply Schedule Task Order to Project Performance Corporation (PPC), supporting the Department of Energy Office of Environmental Management (DOE-EM).  The DUNS and Bradstreet DUNS Number for PPC is 622496230.  The requirement is for the contractor to modify EM?s Integrated Planning Accountability and Budget System (IPABS) to support ARRA data requirements and provide systems support to ensure data quality for the EM Cleanup work associated with Recovery Act activities.  A Time and Materials contract type was selected because the use of a Fixed Price contract would have added substantial contingency costs that may have been restrictive, unnecessary, and inflated.  The Period of Performance is extended through May 31, 2010.

<DESC>The Requisite Pro and SODA License Support and Maintenance contract is a hybrid Fixed Price / Time and Materials Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. Most of the work to be performed is streamlined and consists of standard upgrades and maintenance. But, due to a potential future need to receive training on the new acquired software, emergency maintenance, and conversion of several projects / reports FDA has determined that it is in the best interest of the Government to incorporate an IDIQ line item in the amount of $500,000 that T&amp;M task orders may be placed against.
<p>FINDINGS<br />1. At this time, it is not possible to estimate accurately the extent or duration of the work, or of the anticipated costs, for the additional Requisite Pro related tasks with any degree of confidence.<br />2. Several of the IDIQ tasks may be fixed-price but the emergency maintenance tasks will be Labor Hour. <br />3. A cost-reimbursement contract would be unacceptable as the program office is unable to accurately describe the majority of the work to be performed, unable to estimate the costs up front and, consequently, unable to evaluate a cost proposal.<br />4. Services will be provided by the contractor utilizing the services of negotiated labor categories at specific fixed hourly rates. The hourly rates are fully burdened.<br />5. The Government anticipates materials and labor costs to be associated with some of the additional maintenance, conversion, and migration efforts.<br />6. Government surveillance of contractor work / performance will be by the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR).</p>

In compliance with this Act, the Government posts this notice that change order-1was issued to task order #74 under contract NNJ08JA02C, the Facilities Contract, toprocure facilities support services for Hurricane Ike Phase II repairs funded by theAmerican Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The facilities support services providedunder Task Order #74, Change Order-1 included: &lt;P&gt;1) The contractor is to provide additional support for Roof Packages #1 & #2 to installHEPA filtering on Air Handling Units on an as needed basis to prevent asbestos fibersfrom being spread throughout the building due to spray applied insulation being dislodgedduring the re-roofing operations. &lt;P&gt;2) The contractor is to provide additional support for the Building #1 Window ReplacementProject to prepare each space for window replacement and return it to its originalconfiguration after window replacement is completed. &lt;P&gt;This support is required to prevent health hazards from being created in the buildingduring re-roofing operations and to allow access to spaces for window replacements. &lt;P&gt;Modification 160 was issued for funding of the change order.&lt;P&gt;The Facilities Contract is a firm-fixed-price/cost-plus-award fee/award term contractwhich was awarded on a competitive basis. This task order was issued ascost-reimbursable. A cost-type arrangement is appropriate due to uncertainties involvedin contract performance that do not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracyto use any type of fixed-price contract. In addition, a cost-type task order was selectedto provide the contractor the greatest incentive for efficient and economicalperformance, given the types of services to be performed.

<DESC>The description of work The scope of work includes design, fabrication, installation, commissioning and acceptance testing of all the necessary primary and support systems to operate a completely integrated Altitude Test Facility for the purpose of system-level engine testing for Drive train and Mechanical Research at the new Army Research Laboratory-Vehicle Technology Directorate Facility. The primary function of the HESATF is to provide an altitude simulation chamber capable of testing complete turbo shaft and reciprocating engines (max. 500 hp) under simulated flight conditions. The altitude test chamber shall be capable of simulating altitudes between sea level (14.6 psia) and 25,000 feet (5.46 psia). The combustion air system shall supply -40 degrees F to 130 degrees F at -50 degrees F dewpoint to simulate engine inlet air conditions. The bypass cooling air supply shall keep the ambient air around the test engine below 150 degrees F and provide dilution air for cooling the exhaust gases. The exhaust system shall remove high temperature exhaust gases as well as control the simulated altitude pressure surrounding the test engine in the chamber. HESATF system also includes airflow conditioning, supply air, exhaust air, and dynamometer/gearbox/Torque-Meter. Other systems include process cooling water, electrical power supply, structural steel bedplate, CO2 Fire suppression system, and distributed control.

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because a statute exists that expressly authorizes or requires that the acquisition be made from a specific source or through another agency (FAR 6.302-5); specifically, Sole source awards under the 8(a) Program. Per FAR 6.302-5 a J&A is not required for this award.<br><br>The Contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, supplies, facilities, tools, materials, management, and supervision (except for those items specified as government-furnished property, supplies, equipment and services) necessary to perform non-personal, hospital environmental services to MTFs located on Fort Sam Houston and Camp Bullis, TX, as defined in Performance-Based Statement of Work.  For this effort, MTFs is a collective term of 54 integrated medical, dental, veterinary, and other medical department healthcare and healthcare-related facilities and buildings located on Fort Sam Houston and Camp Bullis, TX.  The raw square feet (RSF) for each MTF are varied; as such, the current aggregate raw square feet (RSF) estimate quantity is 1,863,382.  The RSF applicable to hospital environmental services for BAMC is projected to increase to approximately 2,800,000 (exclusive of 1.75M parking lot and garages) not later than September 2011 due to in-progress base closure and realignment (BRAC) construction and renovation projects.
