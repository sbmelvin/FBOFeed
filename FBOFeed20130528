<DESC>The Contractor shall provide all labor, equipment, materials (that are not furnished by the Government), supplies, and services necessary including all travel and transportation, visa and working permits, lodging and meals to inspect corrosion on the three 133 meters tall guyed antenna towers (MW antenna array) and to install the specified structural members on the antenna towers.&nbsp; The antenna towers are located at Cape Greco, Cyprus.&nbsp; BBG/IBB will supply the structural members and fasteners, as described in the following Statement of Work.<br /><br />Statement of Work (SOW)<br />1. General<br />1.1 The U.S. Broadcasting Board of Governors and the U.S. International Broadcasting Bureau (BBG/IBB) requires a Contractor to inspect corrosion on the three 133 meters tall guyed antenna towers (MW antenna array) and to install the specified structural members on the antenna towers. The antenna towers are located at Cape Greco, Cyprus. BBG/IBB will supply the structural members.<br />1.2 BBG/IBB leases this MW antenna array facility from Audiovisuel Exterieur de la France (AEF) who currently operates the facility. Cape Greco is about 1 hour drive from Larnaca International Airport, Cyprus. The Contractor shall perform the contract work on dry days only and shall not climb any towers on raining days. The Contractor shall coordinate with the BBG/IBB engineer and the AEF Cyprus site manager to perform the contract work Monday through Friday, local time 8:00 am - 4:30 pm except local and Federal holidays.<br />1.3 The three 133 meters tall guyed antenna towers were originally erected at Cape Greco, Cyprus around 1972. The tower sections from base to elevation 23 meters were re-painted in 2002 and 2010 for corrosion control. All structural guys were replaced in 2002. The climbing ladders and the platforms from base to elevation 23 meters were replaced in 2002. The existing climbing ladders and the platforms above elevation 23 meters appear severely corroded and are not safe to use for supporting any riggers.<br />2 Safety Requirements and Contact Information<br />2.1 The Contractor is responsible for safely climbing antenna towers with proper fall protection and for the safety of its materials, tools, employees, personal protective equipment (PPE). Corrosions on the antenna towers have been observed. The Contractor shall comply with U.S. Safety and Health Regulations for Construction (OSHA) safety requirements, including fall protection requirements of OSHA 1926.501.<br />http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_id=10757&amp;p_table=STANDARDS<br />2.2 The Contractor shall use double lanyard to climb and work on antenna towers at all time for fall protection. Using single lanyard will not be permitted. Climbing and working on any antenna towers without 100% tie-off and fall protection will not be permitted.<br />2.3 BBG/IBB headquarters structural engineer: Richard Cai, email address: rcai@bbg.gov, phone: (202) 382-7314.<br />2.4 AEF Cyprus site technical manager: Philippe Sardos, email address: psardos@aol.com, phone/fax: 357-23-83-13-44.<br />3. Inspection Requirements for the Antenna Towers<br />3.1 The Contractor shall:<br />&#61607; Supply all riggers, digital cameras, tools and materials, including safety climbing and personal protection equipment.<br />&#61607; Coordinate all inspection activities with the BBG/IBB engineer and the AEF site manager.<br />&#61607; Safely perform and complete the inspection work within 30 days after the Notice-to-Proceed (NTP) is issued.<br />3.2 The Contractor shall climb all three 133 meters tall guyed antenna towers (MW antenna array) from base to top and use digital cameras to record all corrosions on the antenna towers, including corrosions on the structural guys. When the inspection is complete, the Contractor shall supply the BBG/IBB engineer with two USB flash drives with all recorded photos in JPEG format.<br />4 Requirements of Installation of the Structural Members on the Antenna Towers<br />BBG/IBB will supply and deliver the specified structural members including fasteners in a 20 ft. container to the MW antenna array site at Cape Greco, Cyprus. The specified structural members are:<br />&#61607; 180 angel steel L80x80 brackets with U-bolts<br />&#61607; 180 angel steel L80x80 tower-face bracing members with fasteners<br />&#61607; 180 angel steel L50x50 internal bracing members with fasteners<br />For structural installation details and photo illustration, see attachment No. 1. Statement of Work (SOW) for the Supply of Structural Steel Bracing Members with Fasteners.<br />After inspecting the antenna towers, the Contractor shall safely perform and complete the installation work within 30 days after the Notice-to-Proceed (NTP) is issued.<br />4.1 The Contractor shall:<br />&#61607; Supply all riggers, tools and materials, including safety climbing and personal protection equipment.<br />&#61607; Coordinate all installation activities with the BBG/IBB engineer and the AEF site manager.<br />&#61607; Climb the antenna towers from base to top and mark the locations where the structural members will be installed. All markings shall be made in such a way (such as yellow tapes or color paint or others) that they are clearly visible for BBG/IBB engineer to observe from the ground. All markings and the structural bracing installation locations shall be reviewed and approved by the BBG/IBB engineer prior to the installation.<br />&#61607; Install the structural members. All bolts shall be installed by turn-of-nut tightening method per manual of ninth edition of AISC Steel Construction - allowable steel design. Tighten the nuts so that the joint surfaces are in firm contact with the full effort of a man using ordinary wrench or socket wrench plus 1/3 turn - 1/2 turn in nut rotation.<br />&#61607; Perform necessary field modifications including enlarging or drilling bolt holes on the structural members for fitting purpose.<br />&#61607; Supply and apply zinc primer to all modified bolt holes for corrosion control. All bolt hole modifications must be reviewed and approved by the BBG/IBB engineer.<br />4.2 A complete installed set of the structural bracing members consists of three brackets with U-bolts, three tower-face bracing members L80x80 with fasteners and three internal bracing members L50x50 with fasteners. The Contractor shall install total 60 complete sets of the structural bracings on the three 133m tall guyed antenna towers. Because corrosion conditions vary among the antenna towers, the actual installation of the structural bracing members will not be equally distributed among the three antenna towers.<br />5 Available Government Furnished Tools<br />In general, the Contractor is responsible for the supply and use of his own tools that are required to perform the contract work. BBG/IBB will ship some limited tools along with the specified structural bracing members and fasteners in the 20 ft. container to the MW antenna array site at Cape Greco, Cyprus. The list of the Government furnished tools is attached as Attachment 2 List of BBG/IBB tools. As an option, the Contractor can consider of using the Government furnished tools to perform the contract work. However, the Contractor is responsible for the safety of using all Government furnished tools and is responsible for all repair and replacement for the Government furnished tools when they are damaged or lost due to theft and vandalism.<br />6 Antenna Outage, Contractor's Riggers and Work Duration<br />It is estimated that it will take approximate 30 calendar days for a Contractor's crew of three riggers to complete the contract work. Therefore, BBG/IBB plans for an initial antenna outage time of 30 continuous calendar days to allow the Contractor to perform and complete the contract work. The Contractor shall notify the BBG/IBB engineer 14 calendar days in advance for additional antenna outage time if extra time is required to complete the contract work.

<DESC>1.  Introduction/Purpose    

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA / Government) has a requirement for full-service maintenance, repair and related training services for a Government-owned, Lockheed Martin (LMCT) Pulsed Doppler Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) System.  The LMCT LIDAR System is proprietary, inclusive of specifications and drawings. The FAA anticipates a firm-fixed priced requirement that would involve a one-year base period of performance, with two one-year option periods.  All services are anticipated to take place in Las Vegas, Nevada, at or near the McCarran International Airport.  


2.  Incumbent Contractor 

The incumbent contractor is Lockheed Martin Coherent Tech, Inc.; 135 S Taylor Ave; Louisville, CO 80027-3025.  The contractor is currently providing LIDAR maintenance and repair services under FAA Order Number: DTFAWA-13-P-00155.   


3.  Nature of Competition

The acquisition strategy for the anticipated procurement has not been determined at this time; however, the Government intends to single-source to the incumbent contractor Lockheed Martin unless another potential contractor can clearly demonstrate requisite capability, capacity, technical knowledge and access to Lockheed Martins proprietary specifications and drawings to satisfy the Governments stated needs.   This market survey will assist the Government with a determination as to whether a single-source or competitive process will be utilized and on a full and open, small business or other socio-economic designation set-aside basis.

Scope of Work
The scope of work will include:
The performance of research and writing of a historic resource study for River Raisin National Battlefield Park, in Monroe County and Wayne County, Michigan. The HRS will provide a historical overview of the park that identifies and evaluates the parks cultural resources within historic contexts.  The study shall use current scholarship and other available cultural resources information to develop a synthesis for placing the history of River Raisin National Battlefield Park within a broader local, regional, national, and international context.  The HRS will provide a Cultural Resources Base Map(s) depicting all known historic sites and structures, cultural landscapes, long-distance trails and roads, as well as known archeological and ethnographic resources.  All available cultural resources data will be synthesized in a narrative report.  The study will involve documentary and non-archeological field investigations to determine and describe the integrity, authenticity, associative values, and significance of the parks historic resources, including but not limited to structures, sites, objects, districts, cultural landscapes, complexes, and historic functions.  The recommendation section will identify future needs for special history studies, cultural landscape reports, and other detailed cultural resource studies, as well as making recommendations for resource management and interpretation.  
The contractor shall shepherd the National Register nomination through the Michigan SHPO (and its review board), then to the National Park Service Federal Preservation Officer for signature, and finally to the Keeper of the National Register.  A draft nomination (2011) was prepared but lacks incorporation of specific boundaries.  
The proposal will consist of:
A.	Research strategy B.	Personnel qualifications C.	Cost
The government will review the progress of the report development through required drafts and provide comments as necessary. The Historic resource study outline and bibliography are submitted for National Park Service review and comment by January 31, 2014. The National Park Service will provide review comments on these products to the PI within 45 days.  The PI shall make necessary revisions and re-submit the final chapter outline to the National Park Service within 30 days. By May 31, 2015, historical research and writing is completed; the historic resource study and National Register nomination are in draft form, and submitted for 45-day National Park Service review and comment. Principal Investigator resubmits material in final form within 45 days.  Index is generated and historic resource study is approved by Regional Director, and 200 copies are off-set printed and perfect-bound by September 30, 2015.  During this period, National Register draft nomination completes National Park Service (park and Midwest Region) review; material is submitted for tribal and SHPO review and comment; and material is presented to the Keeper of the National Register for review, comment, revision, and listing.  The contractor shall shepherd the documentation through the entire National Register process, to be completed no later than September 30, 2015.
THIS WILL NOT BE A SEALED BID OR LOW BID PROCUREMENT. A best value trade-off selection process will be conducted in accordance with FAR part 13. At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, portions of FAR parts 12 and 15 may be utilized. This best value approach will use factors such as technical, price, and past performance. It is anticipated the aforementioned factors will be listed in descending order of importance and that all non-price related factors, when combined, will be significantly more important than cost/price. Failure to submit all requested information in the solicitation may result in the entire proposal being disqualified from further competition.
The Government intends to award without discussions, but reserves the right to conduct discussion should it be deemed in the Government's best interest.

<DESC>REHAB HOFR ASH PIT Synopsis/pre-solicitation Notice; this announcement is not a solicitation, but a pre-notice of a proposed contract action.  The primary purposes of this notice are to improve small business access to acquisition information and enhance competition by identifying contracting and subcontracting opportunities.  
GENERAL:  On or about 12 June 2013, The Department of Interior NATIONAL PARK SERVICE intends to solicit competitive offers from eligible small business concerns that specialize in Historic Masonry Restoration to perform the rehabilitation of the historic Ash Pit at the Home of Franklin D. Roosevelt National Historic Site in Hyde Park, New York.   DESCRIPTION:  The Contractor shall be responsible for all materials (excluding salvaged materials on-site), labor, equipment, and supervision necessary to execute the work described in the written specifications and drawings.  The Ash Pit structure originally served as a repository for fireplace-produced ash; and over time the Brick Arch / Roof has partially collapsed due to failure of the mortar joints, and needs to be disassembled and reconstructed using the original materials and new mortar.  As a key feature in the historic core of the park, this ash pit is a unique interpretive tool in discussion of estate life in the period of FDR.  The goal of this project is to restore this historic structure to its former condition in a good state of repair.
SCOPE OF WORK:	The principal features of the work include, but are not limited to, the following: A. Selective Demolition includes: 1. Masonry: Removal of the existing brick at the vault roof in preparation for a new setting bed. The removed brick shall be re-used for the reconstruction of the roof. 2. Masonry: Dismantling of damaged, loose, or displaced areas / sections of brick in preparation for re-building. 3. Masonry : Dismantling of areas / sections of brick wall where individual brick units are cracked through. 4. Masonry: Dismantling the stone steps (located on the north side of the Ash Pit) in preparation for re-setting. 5. Site: Removal of accumulated soil / vegetation / debris at the immediate perimeter of the Ash Pit and stone steps.  Excavation work shall be limited to exposing the brick wall / roof portions of the Ash Pit.  The stone foundation shall remain covered by soil. 
B. Metal Work includes: 1. Repair of the existing cast iron ash chute pintles and frame in preparation for the attachment of a new, fabricated ash chute door. 2. Fabrication and installation of a new cast iron door to be fixed in-place at the top of the ash chute (on the east side). 
C. Masonry Work includes: 1. Rebuilding brick sections that are damaged / displaced; and sections of the wall that have had thru-cracks in the individual brick units. 2. Rebuilding the brick vault roof over a new gravel / sand mix to form the geometrically correct and consistent arch of the roof as it was originally designed. 3. Resetting the adjacent stone steps to a level condition longitudinally. The rise / run ratio shall be consistent throughout.  The treads shall have a 0.25 inch wash. 4. Removal of areas of top soil and/or accumulated organic / inorganic material that built up over the brick work.  The intention is to remove the soil covering to the defined line between the stone foundation (to remain buried) and the originally exposed brick. 
D. Work not included: 1. Complete removal of the gravel/sand infill in the Ash Pit. 2. Excavation beyond 12  18 inches of the perimeter of the Ash Pit and adjacent stone steps.
LOCATION: The Franklin D. Roosevelt National Historic Site is within the National Park Services Roosevelt-Vanderbilt National Historic Site, located 4097 Albany Post Road (Rt. 9) in Hyde Park, New York.  The Ash Pit is located on the west bank, just north of the steps leading to the Pump House. The park headquarters in the Bellefield Mansion at 4097 (Rt. 9G) Albany Post Road, Hyde Park, NY 12538.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the Naval Facilities Engineering and Expeditionary Warfare Center (NEXWC) under FAR 6.102(d)(2) and 35.106. A formal Request for Proposals (RFP), other solicitation, or additional information regarding this announcement will not be issued. 

This announcement is for abstracts only, of approximately five (5) pages or fewer of technical material. Abstracts shall identify the specific topic area that the submission addresses. Each abstract must be specific to one of the topic areas.  

All technology demonstrations or prototype field tests must be performed in Hawaii, Guam, or Washington State.  However, design, laboratory, and administrative work may be done outside of these locations.
 The proposed technology shall address one of the following two technology areas.  

TOPIC 1:  Alternative Energy Technology.  Innovative alternative and renewable energy technologies are sought that can provide on-site energy generating capabilities to Navy facilities at or below the cost of conventional power.  

A technology may be considered innovative if it:

1) significantly reduces the unit cost of energy acquisition, or
2) significantly increases the annual energy production per unit of area used, or
3) provides energy availability at times when other renewable energy sources would not normally be available. 

Renewable energy includes, but is not limited to, marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy (such as energy from waves, tides and currents in oceans, estuaries, and tidal areas), offshore wind energy, waste-to-energy, and hybrid technologies.
 


TOPIC 2:  Energy Storage.  Innovative energy storage technologies are sought to integrate renewable sources at Naval facilities. Energy storage will be evaluated in the context of an enabling technology that supports  renewable energy systems or microgrid management systems.  A technology may be considered innovative if it significantly reduces capital investment,  reduces weight,  increases total storage capacity (kWh), or increases maximum energy discharge rate beyond what is commercially available.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for the Naval Facilities Engineering and Expeditionary Warfare Center (NAVFAC EXWC).  

This announcement seeks out technologies and methodologies to improve expeditionary logistics, and applies to Navy and USMC forward operating environments (for information on the expeditionary environment, see public material on the Marine Corps Operating Concept, Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare, and Enhanced MAGTF Operations). NAVFAC EXWC is interested in expeditionary technologies and methodologies that are new, innovative, advance the state-of-the-art, or increase knowledge or understanding. To be eligible for consideration and possible contract award, the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of any proposed technology or methodology must be 6 or lower.
 

Each submission must address only one of the below areas to be considered.  Multiple submissions are allowed.

TOPIC NO. 1: ENHANCED INFRASTRUCTURE. Innovative technologies are sought to advance the state of the art in lightweight, mobile infrastructure elements such as shelter systems; bridging systems; power generation, distribution, and monitoring equipment; roadway; and landing pad systems. Technologies may include but are not limited to advanced materials, fabrication techniques, repair techniques, modular construction, power transmission, and intelligent resource allocation systems.

TOPIC NO. 2: ENHANCED SELF SUFFICIENCY FOR WATER. Technologies are sought for the treatment of water in the expeditionary environment, with an emphasis on small-scale systems with production rates of up to 1 gallon per minute.
 Topics of interest include disinfection, filtration, and desalination technologies at both the component and system level. Technologies which minimize weight, cube, energy, and logistics requirements are of interest. These may include: advanced filtration barrier technologies with wide operational envelopes (temperature, salinity, contaminates, etc.), field cleanable filter systems, advanced flow schemes for particle separation, small and efficient desalination technologies, anti-fouling technologies, efficiency improvement schemes, and energy recovery technologies. Innovative water packaging, storage, and distribution technologies will be considered, as will water quality-monitoring systems.

TOPIC NO 3: ENERGY EFFICIENT EXPEDITIONARY FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT.
 Technologies are sought for increasing the energy efficiency of expeditionary facilities, to include advanced metering, monitoring, planning, and distribution technologies for control of electrical, water, natural gas, and thermal systems. Insulation and thermal management technologies are sought for all types of shelter systems. Technologies are sought to increase the efficiency of environmental conditioning units (ECUs) by more than 10% relative to currently fielded units. Such technologies may include but are not limited to: modifications which can drop in to existing ECUs, advanced vapor compression cycles utilizing coolants with a global warming potential less than 4, advanced dehumidification technologies to decrease the latent cooling load in humid environments, advanced non-vapor compression cycles, and sorption type systems which can utilize low grade waste heat.

TOPIC NO 4: TOOLS AND METHODS TO FORECAST EFFECTS OF ENHANCED TECHNOLOGIES.
 Innovative tools and techniques are sought to investigate the effects of improved logistics technologies and their added capabilities on future expeditionary operations. Such modeling and simulation tools may be used to guide future logistics technology development.

TOPIC NO 5: ENHANCED LOGISTICS TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES. Innovative sensors, prognostic systems, logistics command and control tools and methods, and modeling and simulation technologies are sought to provide improved awareness of inventory and equipment location and condition, as well as supply chain conditions.

TOPIC NO 6: ENHANCED LOGISTICS AND TRANSPORTATION TOOLS. Transportation and supply chain monitoring is critical for all aspects of expeditionary warfare.
 Open architecture software tools are sought for inclusion in an eco-system of intelligent software agents able to reason over semantically enabled transportation and supply chain data. The primary user interface to these tools will be through web browsers and mobile hand-held devices. Modular tools that operate in a service-oriented architecture and can span the full range of logistics and transportation planning in support of expeditionary warfare are of interest.

<DESC>The United States Air Force, Advanced Power Technology Office (APTO) located at Wright-Patterson AFB (WPAFB), Air Force Research Laboratory, Materials and Manufacturing Directorate (AFRL/RXSC) has an interest in determining existence of a United States based equipment manufacturer(s) that meets the Air Force's (AF) technical and engineering requirements cited in the Sources Sought Statement of Need. During the re-manufacturing of military and aviation equipment thin liquid metal coatings are applied to various components using a technique called brush plating. One example is brush plating a thin film of Cadmium (Cd) on components such as landing gear, bushings or threaded parts installed on the aircraft. This thin layer of Cd provides a lubricious or corrosion resistant repair of worn or damaged metallic Cd coatings. These operations are typically performed on aircraft in general purpose maintenance hangars not specifically designed for capture and treatment of heavy metal containing liquid solutions. This process can result in human exposure to hazardous liquid plating solutions during application resulting from drips from overhead operations or uncontrolled flow down vertical surfaces. Excess or residual solutions on the surface must be properly contained and disposed of properly. As a result the current processes are facing increasing regulatory and operational restrictions.

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;">Cold Weather Aviation System (CWAS)<br />INDUSTRY DAY ANNOUNCEMENT</p>
<p>The Cold Weather Aviation System (CWAS) team will be holding an Industry Day conference on 18 June 2013 at the Foulois Hall Conference Room in Building 146, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH (Map Attached). The purpose of this meeting is to communicate with industry the status of the CWAS acquisition strategy, program plan, and performance requirements. Additionally, we seek contractor feedback on the following:</p>
<p>1. Acquisition strategy<br />2. Program plan<br />3. Estimated cost<br />4. Test schedules<br />5. Performance Specification (P-Spec), Attached</p>
<p>The CWAS program's goal is to provide a CWAS consisting of multi-layered garment(s) to be utilized by Aircrew members performing duties in arctic weather conditions reaching temperatures as low as -49&deg; Fahrenheit in ejection and non-ejection seat type aircraft. These flying duties include: extended periods of operation in airframes with and without degraded environmental control systems, extended periods of ground-handling duties (e.g. pre- and post-flight inspections, cargo movement, servicing) and time spent configuring Aircrew Flight Equipment (AFE). In the event of emergency egress of the aircraft, the CWAS would be the aircrew's primary cold and inclement weather personal protective equipment until they are on the ground and under shelter. Once under shelter, components in the installed aircraft's survival kit will continue to support the survivors.</p>
<p>The Government briefing charts and sanitized questions/answers from one-on-one sessions will be made available on FedBizOps approximately two weeks after the Industry Day.</p>
<p>Those contractors interested in participating should plan to attend the 0900-1100 briefing on 18 June 2013. Due to room size constraints, each company division is restricted to five representatives. Following the briefing, each company will be allocated up to a one half hour (30 minutes) of side session with the government team to provide input in the areas identified above. If your company chooses to attend the Industry Day Conference, please complete and e-mail your registration form to Kristina Dodds at Kristina.Dodds.ctr@wpafb.af.mil, Capt Rebecca Healea at rebecca.healea@wpafb.af.mil and Deborah Clayborn at deborah.clayborn@wpafb.af.mil. All three must be included on the email. Your registration e-mail must be received no later than 4:00 p.m. (Eastern Standard Time) on 7 June 2013. On your registration form you must indicate if you wish to participate in a one-on-one session. Scheduling will be on a first come first serve basis. Sessions will be 1:00-4:00 p.m. on 18 June and 9:00 a.m.-4:00 p.m. on 19 June. Confirmation of a scheduled meeting time will be provided by e-mail. If you choose to have a side session and wish to present a power point presentation please bring your unclassified presentation on appropriately marked CD ROM/DVDs and give it to the government contracting official. Any proprietary information should be clearly marked.</p>
<p>Points of contact for this program are: <br />Capt Rebecca Healea, Tel: 937-255-0610<br />AFLCMC/WNUV<br />rebecca.healea@wpafb.af.mil</p>
<p>Deborah Clayborn, Tel 937-938-0838<br />AFLCMC/WNUK<br />1981 Monahan Way<br />Bldg 12<br />Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433 <br />Deborah.Clayborn@wpafb.af.mil</p>
<p>Briefing charts from the conference will be made available on FedBizOps after the conference.</p>
<p>The industry day is intended for companies seriously considering putting their ensembles (gloves and boots are not being considered in this part of the program) through the required testing described in the attached performance specification within 4 to 6 months after issuance of a Combined Synopsis/Solicitation. The planned strategy is to pursue commercial items or slightly modified commercial items for integration testing after the companies have passed the initial testing in the attached P-Spec. Successful ensembles will be placed on a Qualified Product List for the purpose of future ordering.</p>
<p>Please provide any questions regarding the P-Sec in writing no later than 10 June 2013. These questions, as well as the questions from Industry Day will be answered and posted to FedBizOps.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with <br />O'Brien Scientific Systems, 55 Crystal Ave, #324, Derry, NH for the acquisition of a Service Preventative Maintenance Contract for a 4 MV Van de Graaff Accelerator needed by the Physical Measurement Laboratory (PML) at NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland.<br />Sole Source determination is based on the need to keep the Van de Graaff accelerator, a unique 45 year old piece of equipment, functioning properly. Very few of these types of accelerators exist in the world. As such, there are very few technicians available for repair and service of these accelerators. O'Brien Scientific Systems provides parts and service for electrostatic accelerators, offering on-site service for emergency repairs and troubleshooting as well as maintenance contracts for these systems. Together, their engineers have over 45 years of experience servicing this type of equipment. A preventative maintenance contract for this equipment is the preferred method to spot issues before they become major problems and to keep the equipment in good working order. <br />*****The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 811219, and the size standard is $19.0.
<p>******A determination by the Government whether to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>*****No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for quotations. However, responses received by June 07, 2013 will be considered by the Government.</p>

<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.</p>
<p>52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. This is a competitive best value source selection in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. An award shall be made to this Offeror, subject to a positive determination of responsibility. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award an order for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />(a) FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability. This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(B) Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>
<p><br />(x) Complete all representations and certifications electronically at the following website: https://sam.gov/.

In addition, complete the following Addendum I to 52.212-3:<br /><br />52.212-3 Addendum, Certification to Accept the Government Purchase Card (GPC).

All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority (SPCOA) , or Certificate of Operating Authority (COA)) with the state PUC where services are being provided.

If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. If, during the term of the contract, the TFS change, the contractor must submit supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification. A modification will then be issued based upon the newly documented annual TFS. <br />(ii) The Government shall not prepay for services.<br />(iii) Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.<br />(iv) Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause 252.239-7007, of this contract, the Government may stop the use of any service or facilities furnished under this contract at any time.

The Government shall pay expediting charges only when-<br />(A) They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental regulatory body; or<br />(B) They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other contractual document.<br />(vi) When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may-<br />(A) Provide the equipment; or<br />(B) Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change.

<DESC>The Library of Congress faces many challenges with acquiring, managing, storing, preserving, and making available audiovisual content. The Packard Campus (PCAVC) Film Preservation Laboratory is unique within the Federal sector providing a wide range of film preservation services including the cleaning of archival films as well as developing newly exposed "raw stock" created to copy the images found on archival film elements. The PCAVC requires its professional staff to utilize a wide range of expertise, knowledge, and vision regarding the technical equipment, precise preservation techniques, media, and its associated failure mechanisms. These experts are required to utilize state-of-the art cutting edge technologies to apply preservation techniques to fragile, obsolete, and legacy moving image materials.
<p>Among the many challenges dealt with daily includes the need to preserve and provide access to moving image films in both 16 mm and 35 mm formats. Increasingly within the past few years, the scanning of motion picture images has become an accepted form of preservation -- however, for the long, term archival storage of moving images is still preferred to be on film stock, rather than digital files.</p>
<p>In order to take digital files and create a motion picture film from them, it is necessary to use a device known as a motion picture film recorder. In 2012 the Library of Congress motion picture preservation laboratory acquired an ARRI Laser Film Recorder (LCLSC12C0089) for making film copies from digital files. Laser recorders work best when using film stocks that are specifically optimized for use with the short exposure durations found in laser film recorders. The specifications and amounts required are listed on the chart in section B..</p>
<p>The Library of Congress Packard Campus for Audio Visual Conservation has a requirement to purchase a total of 150 rolls of film stock for use with its laser film recorder, located within the Packard Campus Motion Picture Film preservation laboratory.<br /><br />The purpose of this procurement is to assist the Library in accomplishing part of the Library's strategic goal to "acquire, preserve, and provide access to a universal collection of knowledge and the record of America's creativity".</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS<br /><br />This will be a firm fixed price contract. All interested vendors must bid on the specific types/brand of products noted in section C.4 Deliverables.<br /><br />Motion picture film stock specifically formulated for use with laser film recorders and sold in the United States is available from the following companies:<br /><br />Eastman-Kodak Company, 343 State Street, Rochester, NY 14650-1121, 585-722-0403<br /><br />Fujifilm, NA Motion Picture Group, 2220 Magnolia Ave., Burbank, CA. 91506, 323-957-8824</p>

<CONTACT>David K Field, Purchasing Agent, Phone 508-887-7362, Fax 508-887-7483, Email field.david@jobcorps.org
<DESC><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">THIS IS A UBCONTRACTING OPPURTUNITY<br /><br /><br /></span></strong><span>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">Building 17 is equipped with a 100% outdoor air handling unit (AHU) that during humid and/or very warm seasons delivers unconditioned air to the building that is unacceptable and troublesome. It is the intent to temper this outdoor air being supplied to the building.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">The equipment required to dehumidify and reduce the temperature of the outdoor supplied to the building will include a compressor package (mounted on the flat roof), an air-cooled condenser (set on an on-grade pad, situated near the location of where the NE and NW wings of the building join) and a duct-mounted, direct expansion evaporator (DX) coil at the discharge of the existing AHU. The new system shall have the capacity to dehumidify/cool 5,000 CFM with 360 MBH at the design conditions for Worcester, MA (the higher enthalpy of: the dry bulb with the coincidental wet bulb, or the wet bulb with the coincidental the dry bulb [see latest 95% outdoor ASHRAE Fundamentals]).</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">The compressor package shall be located at the center of the flat roof (or as close as is practical). If this requires relocating existing condensing units, relocate existing condensing units. The compressor package shall use a non ozone-depleting refrigerant, have the ability to incrementally modulate capacity (screw or scroll, not unloading reciprocating) and contribute to a total system EER of 11.5 or better.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">The vertical refrigerant piping to/from the condenser unit and to/from the roof shall be given special attention (system shutdown, oil entrainment, vertical velocity, etc.). The equipment manufacturer shall design the refrigerant piping, or approve the submitted design of the contractor. This design and approval of design shall be submitted to DOL ESC for review.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">The existing roof-mounted AHU was designed to move 10,000 CFM. It is the intent of this project to treat half of this supply air with a DX coil and to bypass the coil with the other half (including a manual damper). The pressure drop across the coil/bypass arrangement shall not exceed 0.15" w.g. This is to produce a lower SHR through the coil and, therefore, deliver drier air to the building7. A discharge air enthalpy sensor is to control cooling capacity with an initial setpoint of 26.5 BTU/pound of dry air (adjustable). The coil must be installed in the AHU discharge duct and, therefore, be located on either the lower portion (half) of the discharge duct or the upper portion. This is due to the downstream horizontal "tee" change in direction. The coil size will require transition ducts entering and leaving the coil (transition duct per SMACNA). The coil will require additional support. The new duct shall be insulated and weatherproofed to equal the existing duct insulation at a minimum.</p>
<p dir="ltr" align="left">After the installation of the above dehumidification/cooling system, perform testing and balancing of the four exhaust fans serving the second and third floor dorm shower/toilet (EFs) located in the attic space. This is to include the fans and all exhaust air inlets/grilles. The final report shall include the initial findings, the final results, the means taken to achieve the final results and any recommendations. The original design documents will be provided and considered the goal of the balancer.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>The solicitation number is 1115909 and is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-66 dated April 1, 2013.</p>
<p>The appropriate NAICS code for this acquisition is 541711 - Research and Development in Biotechnology for which the small business size standard is 500 employees. This acquisition is 100% set aside for small businesses.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>Preclinical evaluation of immunogenicity of live and inactivated vaccines is conducted in a variety of animal models. They have an obvious limitation determined by species-specific differences in immune response to different antigens. Therefore the ultimate assessment of immunogenicity is possible only in human systems. There are a number of in vitro models that study antigenic structure of vaccines rather than its ability to induce specific protective antibodies. It would be highly desirable to assess and qualify an in vitro biomimetic system that would mimic immune responses that occur in humans after administration of protective antigens.</p>
<p>Screening for synthetic immunogenic peptides that could potentially be used as vaccines is also done in animal models that suffer from the same limitations. The need to use animals also limits the number of peptides that may be screened. Use of a high-throughput system would significantly increase chances of finding the right immunogenic peptides.</p>
<p>VaxDesign developed a system that is called MIMIC (Modular Immune In vitro Construct). The MIMIC system is comprised of isolated primary human immune cells integrated into engineered tissue constructs that are functionally equivalent to the physiological environment of the human immune system. By accurately representing the cellular synergy and communication kinetics that are critical for the induction of adaptive immunity in vivo, VaxDesign has shown the potential of the MIMIC model to support the sensitization of primary human B and T cell responses in an in vitro setting.</p>
<p>The study currently being conducted by the Food and Drug Administration's Center for Biologic Evaluation and Research, Office of Biostatistics and Epidemiology (FDA/CBER/OBE) includes 50 donors immunized with Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) (commercial vaccine). Both pre-vaccination and post-vaccination apheresis products have been collected. Various immunoassays were performed based on in vivo/serum, ex vivo, and in vitro/MIMIC assays. Immune response data with regard to serum antibody against polio serotypes 1, 2, and 3, T cell response measured by the enzyme-linked immuno sorbent spot (ELISPOT) and multiparameter flow cytometry, B cell response measured by polio serotype-specific antibody titers, as well as enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay (ELISA) neutralization titers will be available for analysis.</p>
<p>Project Objectives</p>
<p>The goal of this Research Project is to Evaluate and Qualify the MIMIC System and functional immunoassays for Determining the Immunogenicity of Vaccines and Screening Synthetic Peptides as Vaccine Candidates. In addition to helping characterize the immunogenic properties of natural and synthetic peptides, the prospective contractor shall help determine whether the automated MIMIC system is a suitable tool for the high-throughput screening of large libraries of synthetic peptides for potential in vivo immunological activity. The use of fully synthetic peptides to induce protective immunity would have tremendous safety and cost reduction benefits. A major obstacle to realizing synthetic peptide vaccines has been the difficulty in screening synthetic peptides for immunogenic activity. This goal is consistent with FDA's Critical Path goals of bringing new technologies to the development, characterization and validation of the next generation of biological products.</p>
<p>The MIMIC system provides a step-wise immunological progression of a vaccine in the biomimetic of the human immune system Broadly, this encompasses sera evaluations by novel functional assays, vaccine dosing/toxicity in immune cells, and examinations of vaccine inflammatory/reactogenicity potential in the PTE module and capacity to elicit cellular and humoral responses in the LTE module of the MIMIC system. In the current effort, we will qualify the MIMIC with inactivated poliovirus vaccines (IPV) as a model vaccine because of the ample structural and functional information about poliovirus antigens that is available in literature and at the FDA/CBER, as well as a number of comparable vaccine products with different clinical immunogenicity profile. Besides being a model system, development of a new generation of vaccines against polio is currently a high international public health priority. Therefore results of this study will be used to demonstrate feasibility of this in vitro biomimetic approach for other vaccines, e.g., vaccines against various biothreats, as well as to compare immunogenicity of different new IPV products currently under development.</p>
<p>The study will include a statistically relevant number of donors immunized with IPV. The overarching objective is to demonstrate if the results generated in vitro in the MIMIC platform correlate with in vivo responses generated in the same donors immunized with the vaccines. The inherent advantage to this approach is that each donor &lsquo;subject' serves as their own baseline control allowing a pair approach to analysis.</p>
<p>Description of Work/Tasks</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide statistical data analysis and reporting for this project to include:</p>
<p>1. Association/correlation between in vitro immune results obtained in culture and in the in vivo virus-specific responses<br />A statistically relevant number of donors to be determined by the biostatistician at the FDA will be immunized with IPV and the pre-vaccination and post-vaccination apheresis collections from these individuals will be used to seed the MIMIC platform. The in vitro immune results obtained in culture will be correlated against the in vivo virus-specific responses in the following aspects:</p>
<p>. Illustrate similar expansion of antigen-specific precursors/Th differentiation profiles with regard to CD4+T cell responses (quantity and functionality)<br />. Show comparable trends in magnitudes of antigen-specific responses B cell expansion<br />. Demonstrate correlation between in vitro and in vivo trends; and between novel fluorescent adherence inhibition (fADA) and conventional functional assays such as ELISA and neutralization tests</p>
<p>Statistical analyses are to be performed to address the following research objectives as a minimum:</p>
<p>a. Agreement/correlation of the qualitative immune response measures between the in vitro and in vivo methods. The qualitative measures include:<br />i. proportion of positive responses defined as that an antibody level is above a cut-off level considered as protection<br />ii. Proportion of &gt;/= 4-fold antibody increase at post-vaccination compared with baseline (pre-vaccination)<br />b. Agreement/correlation of the quantitative antibody levels across the range of the typical response levels between the in vitro and the in vivo methods. Statistical techniques such as the error-in-variable regression models may be employed to explore the comparability of the in vitro and the in vivo results.<br />c. Validity of using the measured in vitro immune responses to predict the in vivo immune responses. Validation of the MIMIC system and establishment of statistical metrics for the evaluation. The complexity of these validation results will require a significant contribution of a biostatistician to aid in defining statistical relevance and provide scientific validity to the measured responses. Correlations between in vivo (vaccination) and from and in vitro (MIMIC) polio-specific responses will be established by statistical evaluations including multiple regression models and analyses. The study will consider factors such as donor serostatus, assay endpoints, and correlation trends on an individual and population, where applicable.<br />2. Qualification of novel functional assays. While modern immunosorptive methods, such as ELISA, can provide tremendous sensitivity in evaluating the quantity of antibody against a particular antigen target, the lesser sensitive microneutralization and hemagglutination inhibition tests remain important because they provide readouts of the functionality of the humoral immune response that cannot be achieved by immunosorptive assays. Though these assays have a long history of use by many in the field and have well-defined correlates of immunity, they often lack sensitivity, interlaboratory reproducibility, and require the use of live pathogen that can be very cumbersome when dealing with a deadly organism. As an alternative, we have developed a suite of sensitive and cost-effective target-cell based functional assays that can be used to determine whether antibody in donor sera or MIMIC cultures is able to block or neutralize a pathogen of interest; in some cases, these assays can also be used to deduce the mode of inhibition. These techniques offer major advantages over current methods because they were designed to be used with killed organisms, have a high level of sensitivity and reproducibility, are rapid and cost-effective and can be performed in hours rather than days. They can be used to evaluate antibodies in sera samples from donors pre- and post-vaccination and/or following antigen encounter in the MIMIC system.<br />For example, the fluorescent adherence inhibition (fADI) approach provides for a surrogate evaluation of antibody-mediated virus neutralization by measuring the binding of a fluorescently tagged virus or other antigen directly to a target cell population in the presence or absence of graded doses of a test antibody. In the absence of a neutralizing antibody, the fluorescent virus particles will bind the cells, generating a signal on the BioPlex (flow-based fluorescence) reader. In contrast, blocking antibody in sera or with the virus-cell interaction in a dose-dependent fashion. Since all the incubations and wash steps are performed at 4 degrees centigrade (which prevents virus engulfment), the readout of the response reflects exclusively the binding of virus to the cell membrane. The fADI assay will also be qualified in the proposed study with the FDA/CBER via comparison with WHO standard microneutralization assays.<br />3. Exploration of the impact of baseline characteristics of the donors on the validity of the in vitro results<br />4. Development of analysis modules for use in future research of the validity of the MIMIC system for other vaccines.</p>

<DESC>Your professional services are requested as a Counselor for the U. S. Department of State's Career Transition&nbsp;Center (CTC) Job Search Program (JSP).
<p>The George P. Shultz National Foreign Affairs Training Center of the Department of State is the federal government's primary training facility for personnel of the foreign affairs community. The Foreign Service Institute (FSI) is the Department bureau that provides training for employees of the Department of State and&nbsp;other agencies at the Shultz Center. The Career Transition Center offers three major programs to help employees plan for the future and prepare for retirement: The Mid-Career Retirement Planning Seminar (MCRPS), the Retirement Planning Seminar (RPS) and the Job Search Program (JSP).&nbsp;<br /><br />The professional services of a Counselor are needed to help with the transition of the JSP participants from&nbsp;widely varied areas of the Foreign Service and Civil Service in the Department of State and other Foreign&nbsp;Affairs agencies, and include employees who are being voluntarily and involuntarily separated from service&nbsp;with the government. Each participant is beginning a transition to a new life outside the institutional structure they have known. They vary in expertise, rank, race, gender and age, with most being in the range from late-40s to late-60s. Their post-retirement plans are diverse, and their geographic targets include overseas as well as US locations. Some are seeking employment in the private sector; others are interested in not-for-profit&nbsp;organizations or related areas of government service, or educational sectors, and/or part-time or volunteer&nbsp;employment. Some are uncertain of their next steps, and are using the JSP to help them formulate their plans for&nbsp;the future.</p>
<p>The Job Search Program helps employees clarify career goals, assess interests, skills, and values, prepare a&nbsp;resume, build a network of people who can help in finding a job, sharpen interviewing skills, and negotiate&nbsp;salary and benefits. JSP class sizes range from 55 to over 120. The program is offered three times each year,&nbsp;generally in March, August and October.</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level.

<DESC>NASA/NSSC has a requirement for a training program entitled APEX On the Job Technical Training Program.  The objective of the program is for senior expert technical advisors and instructors to design and provide on-the-job training to one or more intact project teams selected by the APEX Program Manager.  The overall mission of APEX in general and on-the-job activity in particular is to mitigate project risks associated with inexperience on the project team. The APEX OJT approach consists of two basic steps:  1. Identify the mission-critical training needs of the project team and of individual project team members, e.g. project manager, systems engineer, scientists and subsystem leads.  The APEX OJT needs assessment takes into account each project team members level of experience and skills gap; project complexity and current life cycle phase, and a technical assessment of the product maturity of project deliverables.  2. Design and implement training activities based on needs assessments that are integrated into the project's schedule, life cycle phase, and mission success criteria. Such activities have included focused seminars to improve a project's execution of risk mitigation, project planning, and systems engineering. This offering shall be held at NASAs Ames Research Center beginning June 17, 2013. NASA/NSSC intends to purchase the above curriculum from Coyote Enterprises Inc., Colorado Springs, Colorado  80906.  Pursuant to FAR 13.106(b), the acquisition of these services has been determined to be reasonably available from only one source.  Competition is impractical for the following reasons: The training is a follow on to NASA Ames APEX training.  The curriculum consists of a continuation of training previously performed under the predecessor contract. Introducing a new vendor to NASA Ames Apex Program would require a significant duplication of work previously performed and, as such, would be cost prohibitive and unnecessary.  Therefore, awarding to any other source is not in the best interest of the Government.   Furthermore, the Contractor has demonstrated extensive and unique expertise in NASA procedural requirements governing space systems engineering and project management for complex space flight projects. Specifically, the contractor has provided expert technical assistance to NASA's Office of the Chief Engineer in the development, communication, and instruction of relevant Agency procedural policies and requirements. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using the procedures in FAR Part 13.106. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 3:30 p.m. Central Standard Time on June 7, 2013.	Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. Capabilities and qualifications should be submitted to Tammy L. McIver at Tammy.L.McIver@nasa.gov. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

Multiple projects in the LTIB involve the detection and quantification of immune subsets from human and mouse peripheral blood (PB). These assays </span><span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">are fundamental for our clinical and pre-clinical studies for the evaluation of the anti-tumor </span><span style="letter-spacing: -.55pt; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">effect of immunotherapy, alone or in combination with other therapies. A significant amount of </span><span style="letter-spacing: -.5pt; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">studies at the LTIB are performed using the flow-cytometer Becton Dickinson (BD) LSR-II. The </span><span style="letter-spacing: -.3pt; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">BD High Throughput System (BD HTS) is a 96-well plate harvester system for the flow&shy;</span><span style="letter-spacing: -.4pt; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">cytometer BD LSR-II. This apparatus is designed for the processing of high number of samples </span><span style="letter-spacing: -.35pt; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">in a fast and controlled fashion. Specifically, the BD HTS is a requirement for the analysis of </span><span style="letter-spacing: -.45pt; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">human peripheral blood (hPB) samples from patients enrolled in our clinical trials. The analysis </span><span style="letter-spacing: -.4pt; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">of these experiments consists usually of 200-600 samples; without this apparatus, the acquisition </span><span style="letter-spacing: -.35pt; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">of these samples necessitates several days, with an enormous expenditure of time and with the </span><span style="letter-spacing: -.45pt; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">risk that the results can be skewed because of differently set experimental sessions; with the BD </span><span style="letter-spacing: -.4pt; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold;">HTS, experiments will last significantly less, the constant presence of an operator will not be necessary anymore, and, most importantly, the samples will be acquired with the same instrumental setting. </span></p>

Fill ins for FAR 52.212-2 are as follows: Award will be made to the offerors (1) whose proposal is technically acceptable and (2) whose technical/cost relationship is the most advantageous to the Government. While cost is secondary to technical, it will be a factor in the award decision. The critical factor in making any cost/technical trade-off is not the spread between the technical scores, but rather what is the significance of that difference. The significance of the spread in scores will be determined on the basis of what that difference might mean in terms of performance and what it would cost the Government to take advantage of it. Awards may not necessarily be made to that offeror submitting the lowest offer. Also, award may not necessarily be made for technical capabilities that would appear to exceed those needed for the successful performance of the work. The Government reserves the right to make cost/technical trade-offs that are in the best interest and to the advantage of the Government. Offerors shall include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representation and Certifications - Commercial Items, with its offer.

Solicitation closing date is 12 June 2013. All quotes must be received by 4:00 p.m. Central Time. The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors.

However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. Offerors shall submit one (1) copies of their quote and the Representations and Certifications (FAR 52.212-3) in person, or mail to the following address: USDA-NRCS, Attn: AQM, Supervisory Contracting Officer, 3381 Skyway Drive, Auburn, AL 36830-6443.

SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT
The Navy intends to solicit and negotiate this contract as a Sole Source Procurement.  
The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, TENCATE ADVANCE COMPOSITS 18410 BUTTERFIELD BLVD.
 MORGAN HILL, CA. 95037 IAW 6.203-1(C).  The basis for restricting competition is the lack of detailed drawings/specifications test procedures and test stations in addition to duplicative costs and time that will be required to reverse engineer the system.  All other offerors may submit a quote that will be reviewed by the Government.  However, a determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this solicitation is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

</strong>
<p>&nbsp;<br />The U.S. General Services Administration on behalf of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) to solicit lease proposals for the rehabilitation and adaptive reuse of NASA's historic Hangar One, located at Moffett Federal Airfield (MFA) in the NASA Ames Research Center at Moffett Field, CA. The proposed long-term lease of Hangar One and MFA offers a unique opportunity for the private sector to collaborate with the government to reposition and manage federally-owned property for private and public sector reuse. The planned long-term lease will utilize Section 111 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (NHPA), which allows Federal agencies to enter into leases of historic property.</p>
<p>Hangar One's footprint is approximately eight acres with exterior dimensions of 1,140 feet long and 308 feet wide. It has approximately 350,000 gross square feet under the steel structure. Due to contamination caused deterioration from the original siding, the Navy removed, but did not replace, the metal siding; leaving exposed the steel frame structure and coating it with epoxy. NASA has not been provided the necessary funds to install new siding to protect the exposed steel frame from the elements.</p>
<p>Hangar One was conceived and constructed from 1931-1933 to support the U.S. Navy's "lighter-than-air" reconnaissance program following World War I. The Hangar was built for the 6,500,000 cubic-foot dirigible, the U.S.S. Macon. However, in 1935, the U.S.S. Macon crashed off the coast of California due to a storm during a training mission. This accident along with the crash of its sister ship, the U.S.S. Akron, effectively ended the "lighter-than-air" program.</p>
<p>Hangar One was used by both the Army Air Corps and the Navy in support of various mission objectives from 1935 until NAS Moffett Field was decommissioned under the 1991 Base Realignment and Closure ("BRAC") process and transferred to NASA. Hangar One, along with Hangars Two and Three are contributing structures of the "U.S. Naval Air Station Sunnyvale, California Historic District," which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.</p>
<p>The Moffett Federal Airfield is approximately 1,000 acres and is operated and managed for ongoing Government and NASA partner needs. The RFP process seeks a tenant to operate, manage and maintain the station and support ongoing Government needs. The prospective tenant may act as a fixed-base operator to allow additional private airfield-related uses and propose other uses consistent with NADP and PEIS along with the historic preservation requirements identified in this RFP.</p>

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br> (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br> (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br> (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C.  362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br> (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br> (1) Listed End Product <br> Listed End Product:	Listed Countries of Origin: <br>   	   <br>   	   <br>   	   <br> (2) Certification.

(Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>5. MARKET VALUE: GS-14 equivalent hourly/daily rate ($40.58 - $52.76/$324.64 - $422.08 - not eligible for locality pay).  Final compensation will be negotiated within the listed market value based upon the candidate's past salary, work history and educational background.  Salaries over and above the top of the pay range will not be entertained or negotiated.</p>
<p>6.  PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  One (1) year, with four (4) option years</p>
<p>STATEMENTS OF LIMITATIONS ON PERIOD/PLACE OF PERFORMANCE AND BENEFITS:</p>
<p>The purpose of this contract is to establish an employee/employer relationship with the contractor to perform services overseas on a temporary, on-call basis as part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) / Office of Civilian Response (OCR) "Firehouse." The Personal Services Contractor(s) hired under this contract will provide up to a maximum of 250 workdays of services on an annual basis.</p>
<p>The specific projects, as well as dates, number of days and locations to be worked will be determined by mutual agreement between the contractor and his/her OCR supervisor according to requests made to OCR by USAID overseas missions. This is an intermittent USPSC solicitation. There is no obligation by OCR to provide assignments for a minimum number of days, and the contractor will be free to provide "blackout" dates during which he/she will not be available to accept assignments.</p>
<p>Upon identification of a temporary need within the scope of work, OCR will contact the contractor and provide the following information:</p>
<p>1.    Date contractor is needed to report to OCR or assignment in the field<br />2.    Duration of Assignment<br />3.    Place of Performance</p>
<p>The contractor will notify OCR whether he/she is available for the assignment within two business days. At the time the contractor accepts the assignment, he/she is expected to commit for the duration of the assignment. While the contractor will be required to commit to a certain time period, it is understood that the exigencies of a crisis may require the assignment to be curtailed or extended (not to exceed 250 days per year). The contractor shall notify OCR at the time of commitment if his or her existing schedule would preclude an extension. Notification of schedule conflicts shall not necessarily disqualify the contractor from the assignment, but will simply assist OCR in recruiting a replacement. Subsequently, if unforeseen circumstances arise, and the contractor needs to curtail the assignment and leave post, the contractor must receive approval from OCR and the Mission prior to departure.</p>
<p>As services provided by the contractor are on a temporary, on-call basis, health and life insurance reimbursements will be provided on a prorated basis based on the number of days during which the contractor actually provides services.</p>
<p>7.  PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:  Overseas<br /> <br />There may be an initial orientation and training program in Washington, D.C. This may include formal classroom training, online training, on-the-job training, security training and pre and post deployment briefings/meetings. After completion of appropriate training, the Crisis Response Program Officer will be considered available for overseas assignment.</p>
<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Civilian Response (OCR) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support USAID missions abroad when faced with a natural disaster, political crisis, internal conflict or otherwise in need of surge staff support due to some unforeseen circumstance. Created in 2008, OCR provides crisis staffing to USAID missions throughout the world with a full range of specialized expertise.  Since then this office has provided over 20,000 days of mission support in deployments to countries such as Libya, Tunisia, Kyrgyzstan, Sri Lanka, Burma, Honduras, Somalia, South Sudan, Democratic Republic of  Congo, and many other countries. As a member of OCR's team of crisis responders, you would be available at short notice to bring to USAID missions your specialized skills in support of a mission's response to a crisis.</p>
<p>USAID is striving to become an even more nimble and agile organization when responding to crises. Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a crisis or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot always be fully addressed by a traditional USAID mission staffing yet timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed state. OCR plays a unique role in USAID by ensuring the USAID mission has sufficient staff with the right skills during those critical golden hours.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet USAID mission needs, OCR retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs) as part of a "Firehouse". These knowledgeable and skilled professionals are rapidly available to missions to expand their capacity, augment their existing capability, fill in gaps, replace evacuated staff, or in some cases project USAID presence to field sites or non-presence countries. OCR staff provide specialized skills in a range of areas from contracting to communications, program design, election monitoring, project management, development outreach, reporting, and strategic planning, and others. As a member of the "Firehouse" you would play a crucial role in supporting USAID programs at a time when their success is most critical.</p>
<p>The OCR "Firehouse" comprises USPSCs on intermittent contracts providing support when changed circumstances in a country necessitate an increase in staffing or additional specialized skills. Those serving in the Firehouse must be prepared to work abroad in USAID missions and embassies, often with little time for preparations.  Deployments can be for any period of time from 2 months to almost a full year.</p>
<p>USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits.  For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 11 of this solicitation.</p>

<p>&emsp;<br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>Acquisition &amp; Assistance Policy Directive (AAPD) No. 06-10<br />PSC Medical Expense Payment Responsibility</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>The purpose of this contract is to establish an employee/employer relationship with the contractor to perform services overseas on a temporary, on-call basis as part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) / Office of Civilian Response (OCR) "Firehouse." The Personal Services Contractor(s) hired under this contract will provide up to a maximum of 250 workdays of services on an annual basis.</p>
<p>The specific projects, as well as dates, number of days and locations to be worked will be determined by mutual agreement between the contractor and his/her OCR supervisor according to requests made to OCR by USAID overseas missions. This is an intermittent USPSC solicitation. There is no obligation by OCR to provide assignments for a minimum number of days, and the contractor will be free to provide "blackout" dates during which he/she will not be available to accept assignments.</p>
<p>Upon identification of a temporary need within the scope of work, OCR will contact the contractor and provide the following information:</p>
<p>1.    Date contractor is needed to report to OCR or assignment in the field<br />2.    Duration of Assignment<br />3.    Place of Performance</p>
<p>The contractor will notify OCR whether he/she is available for the assignment within two business days. At the time the contractor accepts the assignment, he/she is expected to commit for the duration of the assignment. While the contractor will be required to commit to a certain time period, it is understood that the exigencies of a crisis may require the assignment to be curtailed or extended (not to exceed 250 days per year). The contractor shall notify OCR at the time of commitment if his or her existing schedule would preclude an extension. Notification of schedule conflicts shall not necessarily disqualify the contractor from the assignment, but will simply assist OCR in recruiting a replacement. Subsequently, if unforeseen circumstances arise, and the contractor needs to curtail the assignment and leave post, the contractor must receive approval from OCR and the Mission prior to departure.</p>
<p>As services provided by the contractor are on a temporary, on-call basis, health and life insurance reimbursements will be provided on a prorated basis based on the number of days during which the contractor actually provides services.</p>
<p>7.  PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:  Overseas<br /> <br />There may be an initial orientation and training program in Washington, D.C. This may include formal classroom training, online training, on-the-job training, security training and pre and post deployment briefings/meetings. After completion of appropriate training, the Crisis Response Program Officer will be considered available for overseas assignment.</p>
<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Civilian Response (OCR) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support USAID missions abroad when faced with a natural disaster, political crisis, internal conflict or otherwise in need of surge staff support due to some unforeseen circumstance. Created in 2008, OCR provides crisis staffing to USAID missions throughout the world with a full range of specialized expertise.  Since then this office has provided over 20,000 days of mission support in deployments to countries such as Libya, Tunisia, Kyrgyzstan, Sri Lanka, Burma, Honduras, Somalia, South Sudan, Democratic Republic of  Congo, and many other countries. As a member of OCR's team of crisis responders, you would be available at short notice to bring to USAID missions your specialized skills in support of a mission's response to a crisis.</p>
<p>USAID is striving to become an even more nimble and agile organization when responding to crises. Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a crisis or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot always be fully addressed by a traditional USAID mission staffing yet timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed state. OCR plays a unique role in USAID by ensuring the USAID mission has sufficient staff with the right skills during those critical golden hours.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet USAID mission needs, OCR retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs) as part of a "Firehouse". These knowledgeable and skilled professionals are rapidly available to missions to expand their capacity, augment their existing capability, fill in gaps, replace evacuated staff, or in some cases project USAID presence to field sites or non-presence countries. OCR staff provide specialized skills in a range of areas from contracting to communications, program design, election monitoring, project management, development outreach, reporting, and strategic planning, and others. As a member of the "Firehouse" you would play a crucial role in supporting USAID programs at a time when their success is most critical.</p>
<p>The OCR "Firehouse" comprises USPSCs on intermittent contracts providing support when changed circumstances in a country necessitate an increase in staffing or additional specialized skills. Those serving in the Firehouse must be prepared to work abroad in USAID missions and embassies, often with little time for preparations.  Deployments can be for any period of time from 2 months to almost a full year.</p>
<p>USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits.  For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 11 of this solicitation.</p>

The contractor will be responsible for liaising with senior professionals and officials at USAID, the State Department, other agencies of the US Government, international organizations, and civil society abroad.   The incumbent will also be responsible for visiting sites at which USAID programs are being carried out and for acting in accordance with applicable USAID and U.S. government rules and regulations.   The incumbent will provide advice and guidance to resolve, implement, and manage policy issues.  He/she will advise the Agency, USAID mission, and other development collaborators about the range and relative effectiveness of mission programs.</p>

The incumbent will be responsible for ensuring that U.S. government and USAID interests are protected and coordinated and that policy is properly and consistently implemented.   Leadership, oversight, administrative duties, and backstopping of other USAID mission staff may be required.   The incumbent will be expected to perform under administrative direction with latitude for the exercise of independent judgment in areas such as program and project development and management, but will not make policy.</p>
<p><br />The Crisis Response Program Officer may be responsible for:</p>
<p>&#9679;	Devising and developing long-range plans, goals, and objectives for USAID mission programs, including input into the Country Development and Cooperation Strategy (CDCS), the annual Program Performance Review (PPR), Mission Orders, and other policies.<br />&#9679;	Identifying development constraints (political, cultural, and economic).<br />&#9679;	Overseeing, coordinating, and evaluating selected program operations for the USAID Mission.<br />&#9679;	Undertaking the planning, design, development, negotiation, and implementation of projects as needed and serving as project manager for professional development programs and projects.<br />&#9679;	Assisting with the management and oversight of grants and contracts for which USAID is responsible. <br />&#9679;	Developing new ways to help programs meet established goals, measures, and objectives for program effectiveness.<br />&#9679;	Evaluating and monitoring the performance of partner organizations, grantees, and contractors.<br />&#9679;	Applying technology to a variety of different types of work.<br />&#9679;	Undertaking clerical and/or administrative tasks when needed.</p>

As such, the contractor will be expected to conform to all embassy and/or USAID mission policies and procedures at his or her assignment location regarding housing, work hours, diplomatic protocols, and security. The contractor may be required to staff field offices or other locations off-site of the USAID mission or embassy. Many of the overseas environments in which the contractor may be required to work present a health risk such as: extreme air pollution, lack of potable water, or presence of waterborne and other communicable diseases. Special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, exposure to severe weather conditions, working in non-permissive environments, restrictions on movement and/or evacuations of a USAID mission or embassy may occur.</p>

<p>Acquisition &amp; Assistance Policy Directive (AAPD) No. 06-10<br />PSC Medical Expense Payment Responsibility</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

Evaluation Factors: FACTOR #1: PAST PERFORMANCE #2: PRICE #3: DELIVERY. PRICE AND PAST PERFORMANCE ARE CONSIDERED EQUAL, BOTH ARE GREATER THAN DELIVERY <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ??6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ??6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ??6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Funds are not presently available for this contract. The Government?s obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer. <BR> <BR>

Evaluation Factors: FACTOR #1: PAST PERFORMANCE #2: PRICE #3: DELIVERY. PRICE AND PAST PERFORMANCE ARE CONSIDERED EQUAL, BOTH ARE GREATER THAN DELIVERY <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ??6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ??6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ??6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>Funds are not presently available for this contract. The Government?s obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer. <BR> <BR>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00).

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

Therefore, any subsequent protest to GAO must be filed within 10 days of knowledge of initial adverse agency action. <BR> <BR>USE OF PAST PERFORMANCE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SYSTEM ? STATISTICAL REPORTING (PPIRS-SR) IN PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION (1)   The offeror?s past performance shall be evaluated in accordance with FAR 13.106-2 or 15.305(a)(2), as applicable.  This procurement is subject to Past Performance Information Retrieval System ? Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR), authorized by the Department of Defense for use by participating activities during the acquisition of supplies and services.  
(2)   The purpose of the PPIRS-SR is to provide contracting personnel with quantifiable past performance information regarding delivery and quality, as collected from existing DoD reporting systems.  PPIRS-SR uses the past performance data collected to classify each supplier?s performance by Federal Supply Class(es) or Service Code(s).
(3)   Quality:  The method used in PPIRS-SR to classify the quality of a supplier?s past performance is a comparison of quality records among all suppliers who have provided goods or services to the Federal Government which are categorized in the same Federal Supply Class or Service Class (FSC).  Based on the comparison among suppliers in a specific FSC group, suppliers are classified by PPIRS-SR into a color rating that represents the supplier?s overall quality performance for that specific Federal Supply Class or Service Class.  The following is a summarization of the PPIRS-SR classification colors:
1.  Dark Blue:Top 5% of suppliers in FSC group* 2.  Purple:Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group* 3.  Green:Next 70% of suppliers in FSC group* 4.  Yellow:Next 10% of suppliers in FSC group* 5.  Red:Bottom 5% of suppliers in FSC group*
* If all supplier performance ratings for an entire FSC group are equal, all suppliers in that group will be classified Green.
(4)   Delivery:  Supplier delivery past performance is classified in PPIRS-SR by the supplier?s percentage of on time deliveries.  On time deliveries are calculated using the number of line items delivered and a weighting factor which reflects the length of time a delivery was overdue.
(5)   PPIRS-SR classifications are established monthly for each supplier and can be reviewed at http://www.ppirs.gov/.  Suppliers are granted access to PPIRS-SR for their own classifications.  Offerors are encouraged to review their own classifications as well as the PPIRS-SR reporting procedures and methodology detailed in the PPIRS-SR Procedures Manual and the PPIRS-SR User Guide available at http://www.ppirs.gov.  The method to challenge a rating is also found on the identified website.
(6)   Suppliers with no history in PPIRS-SR will be considered to have a neutral PPIRS-SR rating. <BR> <BR>Due to the interrelationship of supplies and/or services to be provided hereunder, the Government reserves the right to make a single award to the offeror whose offer is considered in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered.  Therefore, offerors proposing less than the entire effort specified herein may be determined to be unacceptable. <BR> <BR>1)   Award under this procurement will be made to the technically acceptable quote/offer which is most advantageous to the Government, price and past performance considered.
2)   Technically Acceptable - In order to be determined technically acceptable, offers must meet or exceed the specifications, delivery requirements, and other terms and conditions in the solicitation and any subsequent amendments.  If applicable, offers must also meet the requirements of FAR 52.211-6 Brand Name or Equal.   The offer must be determined to be technically acceptable before further consideration.
3)   Price - Evaluation of price will include the following:
(  )Single Award evaluation per the paragraph entitled "Single Award for All Items". (  )Split Award evaluation per the paragraph entitled ?Evaluation of Offers for Split Awards?. (  )Transportation costs per FAR 52.247-__@@___. (  )Evaluation of Options per FAR 52.217-__@@__.
4)   Past Performance - Evaluation of past performance will be based on information obtained from PPIRS-SR as well as any other sources which may have relevant information.  A quote/offer with a low PPIRS-SR rating (red or yellow for quality and/or less than a 70 weighted delivery score) may not represent the most advantageous quote/offer to the Government. <BR> <BR>F.O.B. DESTINATION  (NOV 1991) <BR> <BR>F.O.B. ORIGIN, FREIGHT PREPAID (FEB 2006) <BR> <BR>F.O.B. ORIGIN (FEB 2006) SHIPPING WITH NOLSC INFORMATION WILL BE PROVIDED UPON AWARD. <BR> <BR>

<DESC>Questions and Responses
<p>1. The quantity of hours listed for each labor category under the base year and all option years on pages 3 -8 of the solicitation is 2000. Since the base year is only 3 months long should offers use a pro-rated 500 hours per labor category when developing the pricing for the base year?</p>
<p>Response: The Base year will be from July 1, 2013 - March 31, 2014. Therefore use 1286 hours for the Base Year.</p>
<p>2. Should the offeror add in an estimated travel amount per year for pricing purposes or will the government provide an estimated amount?</p>
<p>Response: The estimated amount for travel is $300.00/year.</p>
<p>3. Who are the executive sponsors responsible for this PMO solicitation?</p>

<p>5. As this is procurement for a BPA, please advise which, if any positions are considered key, as Key <br />Personnel are typically identified at the task order level.</p>
<p>Response: The Project Manager and Business Resource Analyst for the first BPA call are key positions. Each subsequent call will identify key positions.</p>
<p>6. Given the importance of completely avoiding any perceived or actual conflicts of interest, are current IT vendors who perform work at Commerce Headquarters conflicted out of bidding on the solicitation?</p>
<p>Response: All vendors must abide by the terms and conditions of their respective contract. However there is no overall prohibition concerning current IT vendors bidding on the solicitation.</p>
<p>7. If the winning bidder performs acquisition related support services for OCIO, would they be conflicted out of subsequent solicitations at the Department of Commerce?</p>

<p>Response: Not sure at this time.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />The U.S. General Services Administration on behalf of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) to solicit lease proposals for the rehabilitation and adaptive reuse of NASA's historic Hangar One, located at Moffett Federal Airfield (MFA) in the NASA Ames Research Center at Moffett Field, CA. The proposed long-term lease of Hangar One and MFA offers a unique opportunity for the private sector to collaborate with the government to reposition and manage federally-owned property for private and public sector reuse. The planned long-term lease will utilize Section 111 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (NHPA), which allows Federal agencies to enter into leases of historic property.</p>
<p>Hangar One's footprint is approximately eight acres with exterior dimensions of 1,140 feet long and 308 feet wide. It has approximately 350,000 gross square feet under the steel structure. Due to contamination caused deterioration from the original siding, the Navy removed, but did not replace, the metal siding; leaving exposed the steel frame structure and coating it with epoxy. NASA has not been provided the necessary funds to install new siding to protect the exposed steel frame from the elements.</p>
<p>Hangar One was conceived and constructed from 1931-1933 to support the U.S. Navy's "lighter-than-air" reconnaissance program following World War I. The Hangar was built for the 6,500,000 cubic-foot dirigible, the U.S.S. Macon. However, in 1935, the U.S.S. Macon crashed off the coast of California due to a storm during a training mission. This accident along with the crash of its sister ship, the U.S.S. Akron, effectively ended the "lighter-than-air" program.</p>
<p>Hangar One was used by both the Army Air Corps and the Navy in support of various mission objectives from 1935 until NAS Moffett Field was decommissioned under the 1991 Base Realignment and Closure ("BRAC") process and transferred to NASA. Hangar One, along with Hangars Two and Three are contributing structures of the "U.S. Naval Air Station Sunnyvale, California Historic District," which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.</p>
<p>The Moffett Federal Airfield is approximately 1,000 acres and is operated and managed for ongoing Government and NASA partner needs. The RFP process seeks a tenant to operate, manage and maintain the station and support ongoing Government needs. The prospective tenant may act as a fixed-base operator to allow additional private airfield-related uses and propose other uses consistent with NADP and PEIS along with the historic preservation requirements identified in this RFP.</p>

<p>This announcement constitutes a Formal Synopsis for the Tinker Air Force Base, F117-PW-100 Engine Overhaul and Supply Chain Management (SCM) program.</p>
<p>The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC) will award one Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. The Air Force will acquire this requirement through an Air Force Source Selection. It is anticipated that the resultant contract will be a FAR Part 12 IDIQ contract with Firm Fixed Price (FFP) and Time &amp; Material (T&amp;M) line items. The awarded contract will consist of one three-year basic ordering period and four one-year incentive option periods.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be accomplished under NAICS Code 336412 and its applicable size standard. This acquisition is not a small business set aside.</p>
<p>Description of services: The Air Force requires overhaul and depot supply chain management (SCM) of F117-PW-100 (F117) engines to ensure serviceable, ready-to-install, spare engines are available to support Serviceable Propulsion Systems (SPS) and War Readiness Engines (WRE) levels. The overhaul effort is comprised of key logistics and maintenance processes to include engine receipt, induction, disassembly, inspection, required maintenance, reassembly, test, transportation, and packaging. The SCM effort consists of forecasting, repairing, acquiring, stocking, storing, issuing, and transporting all the parts necessary to support F117 depot overhaul.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency. Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation through FedBizOps at http://www.fbo.gov. Solicitation requests can be submitted to Mary Skaggs via email at mary.skaggs@tinker.af.mil. <br /><br />Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at 405-736-3273. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.</p>

<DESC> <br>      <br>   The U.S. Army Contracting Center (ACC-NJ-ET) on behalf of Armament Research, Development, and Engineering Center (ARDEC) of Ben t Laboratories, Watervliet Arsenal, Watervliet, NY, is conducting a market survey to identify potential sources of equipment for measuring and recording time-resolved mass loss information during millisecond (0.5 ms to 10 ms) laser pulse heating. During the laser pulse heating, some materials may lose mass due to thermal degradation and ablation and a system that can measure this mass loss in real-time is desired. The capabilities described below are OBJECTIVE requirements.  It is recognized that a system having all of these capabilities may be impractical, and that some trade-offs may be necessary.    <br>      <br>   The OBJECTIVE system shall include:   <br>      <br>   1.	Time resolution:   <br>   The ability to record weight changes of a material with microsecond time resolution. If a laser pulse is 0.5 ms in length, for example, the system would need to collect data on the weight loss of the sample fast enough so that data points could be collected to provide a useful mass loss curve. It is expected that this could be accomplished with 10-50 microsecond resolution or better (objective).   <br>      <br>   2.	Mass resolution:   <br>   The system would need to be able to measure mass changes on the order of 1 microgram (objective), or resolution of 10 micrograms (threshold). The sample will be losing material as a result of being hit by a laser pulse and the effects of this need to be incorporated into the mass measurement.   <br>      <br>   3.	Max sample weight   <br>   It is desired that the system can hold a sample that weighs several grams (objective) with an area on the order of 1 cm2. The system is preferred to not contain any obstructions above the sample. This allows the laser pulse beam to have access to the sample top surface for heating. If absolutely necessary, this could be altered. Allowing the system to be tilted is also a preferred capability.   <br>      <br>   4.	Data collection:   <br>   The system must be able to collect the mass data and transfer the data to a laptop computer where data can be analyzed in mass change vs. time format.   <br>      <br>   5.	Triggering:   <br>   It is desired that the system could be triggered from the laser or function generator to start collecting data (threshold).   <br>      <br>   6.	Installation and onsite training services   <br>      <br>   7.	Minimum 1 year warranty from installation   <br>      <br>   This announcement constitutes an official Request for Information (RFI). Any information or brochures submitted will be used for planning purposes only and shall not be considered as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government to purchase the mass loss measuring system. This request does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract (see FAR 15.201(e)). No funds have been authorized, appropriated, or received for this effort.    <br>      <br>   Responses:   <br>      <br>   Interested organizations should submit a company brochure or a tailored capability statement for these requirements that clearly details the ability to perform the aspects of the notice described above. All proprietary information should be marked as such. Responses will be reviewed by Benet Laboratories personnel only and will be held in a confidential manner. Submitted documentation will not be returned. Any and all information provided shall include system specifics including the following:   <br>      <br>   a. Time resolution   <br>   b. Mass resolution and information on the maximum weight of sample that can be measured   <br>   c. Method used to measure the mass change   <br>   d. Representative mass vs. time data plots   <br>      <br>   Submission Information:   <br>      <br>   Responses to the RFI must be received no later than COB 1600 EST on May 17, 2013 via email.  Interested firms should provide their address, point-of-contact with telephone number and e-mail address.  The Point of Contact for this action is Lauren McDermott, Contract Specialist, U.S. Army Contracting Command-New Jersey, ACC-NJ-ET, Bldg. 40 Watervliet Arsenal, NY 12189; email: lauren.a.mcdermott.civ@mail.mil  NO TELEPHONE INQUIRIES WILL BE ACCEPTED. The Government will accept written questions by email to Lauren McDermott at lauren.a.mcdermott.civ@mail.mil    <br>      <br>

The GSS shall provide a non-magnified, illuminated reflex or holographic sight with adjustable illumination.   <br>    <br>  10. Illumination shall be compatible with image intensified (I2) devices on low power and be daylight visible on high power.  <br>    <br>  11. The GSS will allow the operator to aim the proper super-elevation, based on the range value to the target and the ballistics of the ammunition.  <br>    <br>  12. The GSS shall achieve accuracy equal or better than the current baseline system, M320 with leaf sight, during day and night time conditions.   <br>    <br>  13. GSS shall provide a M320/M320A1 compatible centerline mounting bracket for mounting the GSS directly above the M320/M320A1 receiver in the stand-alone configuration. The Government defines centerline mounting to be the location in line with the centerline of the M320 barrel.   <br>    <br>  14. The GSS shall retain zero when dismounted and mounted on the same weapon within 0.5 mrad.  The capability for the GSS to retain zero when dismounted and mounted on the same weapon within 0.25 mrad is desired.  <br>    <br>  15. The GSS shall attach to the MIL-STD 1913 rail without the use of special tools.  <br>    <br>  16. The GSS, while continuously mounted on the M4, shall maintain zero within 1.0 mrad after firing three basic loads of 5.56mm and M433 40mm Low Velocity ammunition.  The capability for the GSS continuously mounted on the M4, to maintain zero within 0.5 mrad after firing three basic loads of 5.56mm and M433 40mm Low Velocity ammunition is desired.   <br>    <br>  17. The GSS shall utilize batteries currently in the Army supply system (AA, CR 123, CR 2032).  <br>    <br>  18. The batteries shall be easily replaced without removing the GSS from the weapon, and without affecting zeroing/sight alignment.  <br>    <br>  19. The GSS shall operate in hot, basic, and cold climatic zones.   The capability for the GSS to also operation in extreme hot and cold is desired.  <br>    <br>  20.

The Contractor shall promptly pay any such reduction within 30 days unless the parties agree otherwise. The Government within 30 days will pay any such increases, unless the parties agree otherwise. The Contractor?s payment will be made by check.

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.

System must provide the following salient characteristics:
1.Triage Categories
a.Needs to be able to triage patients.  The system will issues a number to the patient based on predetermined categories (Emergency Room, Pts with Appointments, Refill prescriptions, Etc)
b.System will display (on each licensed PC) to staff the number of patients waiting in each category for how long
c.Pharmacy staff then can selectively call the patient to the window, based on the urgency
2.Web Based Software ? each PC can access the program without it necessarily being installed on the PC.  Management will have be able to direct the workflow, example:  If there are a high number patients in the waiting room, pharmacist can be quickly taken off other tasks, just for a few moments to process the patients.  And if there is a low volume patients waiting yet a high volume of prescriptions to verify and dispense workload can be directed there.  
3.Reporting:  System need to have capability to generate a variety of reports
a.Average Waiting Time ? b.% of Patients seen in less than XX time ? ideal to show leadership how long it takes to acknowledge a patient that is in the waiting room c.Patients Per Day ? Pharmacy interacts with many patients in the booth for whom these are no prescriptions generated inside (questions, process for mail, etc).  This real workload that really is not measurable without a system like this.
4.Self serve for patients:  Kiosk that patient can receive a number from a central point in the lobby.

<POPADDRESS>Our Lady  Cleveland CDNST is located north of Butte, MT with access from either the Whitetail-Pipestone OHV area or I-15 Elk Park Exit. 

To access the project from I-15 travel north from Butte on I-15. Take the Elk Park Exit approximately 13 miles from Butte. Go east at the exit and take an immediate right onto the frontage road headed south. Turn left onto Nez Perce Road less than 1 mile from the frontage road junction and drive on the Nez Perce Road for approximately 3 miles to the Nez Perce Trailhead. The trailhead is currently just a wide spot in the road with some old directional signs. Go up the Nez Perce Trail No. 7092 about 6 miles to the junction with new pink and black flagging. Immediately after the junction with the flagging there is a meadow with turnpike that hooks around to the east. Youll know youve gone too far if you get to that point. 

To access the project from Whitetail-Pipestone OHV area travel east on I-90 from Butte. Take the Homestake Exit and drive north on the Delmoe Lake Road for approximately 10 miles.  Go past Delmoe Lake and right after a bridge turn left. The road is not marked. There is a gate with a 4-wheeler go-around. If youre continuing on a 4-wheeler or dirt bike, park before the turn and ride rather than drive up to the gate. Stay on the main trail and ride or hike about 6 miles to a large mining site. The mining site is just after the junction with new trail. Park near the mine and walk back down the road a short distance. Look for pink and black flagging. This is STA 169+90.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAVAIR WD) China Lake, CA intends to issue a firm-fixed price modification to provide additional production units of Miniaturized I/J Digital RF Memory (DRFM) systems on an existing contract on an other than full and open competition basis. This action is for an additional 63 mini DRFMs (1611AS13830). The contract end date will not be extended. This modification is sole sourced to Mercury Defense Systems, 10855 Business Center Drive Cypress CA 90630-5252 based on 10 U.S 2304 (c) (1) Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The incumbent contractor is the only source capable of providing the mini DRFMs within the limited timeframe required to meet critical Fleet operational needs.
 The current design cannot be duplicated without the proprietary data and starting over with a new design would incur a significant cost and time delay to qualify the new design. The time delay for developing an alternate design is estimated to be up to 60 months.

No solicitation will be issued; however, any firms believing that they can fulfill the requirement may submit a written response to be received at the contracting office no later than 15 days after the date of publication of this notice, clearly showing its ability to do so without causing programmatic hardships. Responses and requests shall be submitted to Dan Sciambi 429 E Bowen Rd. M/S 4015 Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, China Lake,
CA 93555.
 Or by email to daniel.sciambi@navy.mil. 
Award is anticipated in July 2013. See numbered notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to update the range of prospective businesses from which proposals to a future solicitation for required products and/or services may be considered.   The Contracting Officer has determined that this requirement is affected by the recent DynaLantic Corp. ruling (case 1:95-cv-02301-EGS(D.D.C.)) injunction regarding 8(a) set aside awards for simulation related training.  The acquisition is now anticipated as a 100 percent Small Business set aside rather than an exclusive 8(a) set side.  A DRAFT of the CBID II requirement statement of work (SOW) is also provided with this amendment.  <br>  <br> Description:   <br>  <br> Small businesses, based upon the size standard for NAICS 541519 (Other Computer Related Services) and those qualifying under related Small Business Administration socioeconomic contracting programs, that possess the resources/capabilities necessary, either individually or as a team, to successfully perform in the business areas and adequately manage a contract with the expected performance period and ceiling value, may respond to any eventual solicitation for this requirement. The anticipated period of performance of a contract which might result from a future solicitation for the required products/services is not more than five (5) years with an estimated ceiling value of between $60 million. <br>   <br> The point of contact for this action Mr. H. David Carter, Contract Specialist, e-mail: harrison.d.carter@us.army.mil. <br>  <br> THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION AND DOES NOT OBLIGATE THE GOVERNMENT TO ISSUE A SOLICITATION. <br>

<AWARDEE>PLATEAU SYSTEMS, LTD 4401 WILSON BLVD # 400 ARLINGTON, VA 22203-2120
<DESC>NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION NASA SHARED SERVICES CENTER LIMITED SOURCE JUSTIFICATION I recommend NASA, NASA Shared Services Center (NSSC) negotiate with Success Factors (Formally Plateau Systems Ltd), only for continued maintenance of the Agency's Learning Management System (LMS) software licenses required for NASA's SATERN Training Management System. This action will result in a delivery order against GSA Contract GS-35F-0069M. The total estimated cost of this effort is $xxx,xxx.xx.  The period of performance is for a 12 months from May 15, 2013 through May 14, 2014. This procurement is for the renewal of annual software maintenance services for the Agency's current Learning Management System (SATERN) license which currently supports a user base of 75,000 users. The maintenance will consist of the following: 	The delivery of Releases, Versions, Correction Levels and Software correction packages, technical support via telephone, and remote support/update. 	Maintenance of Success Factors Training Materials. This recommendation is made pursuant to FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B), which implements the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) Program cited in FAR 8.401 pursuant to Title Ill of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C. 251) and Title 40 U.S.C. 501, Services for Executive Agencies, for the acquisition of supplies or services when only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because of the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized. Competition is impractical for the following reasons: 1.  Under the Federal eGov initiative, NASA competitively selected Success Factors in late 2005, to be the primary commercial off the shelf (COTS) software vendor for the management and documentation of NASA-wide training.  Success Factors LMS is the single source uniquely positioned in the market to provide the services as required due to their proprietary ownership of the software.	Choosing an alternative solution will result in removal of the existing capabilities without the guarantee and assurance of a suitable replacement.  Furthermore, any deviation from the current solution would cause major service disruptions and require a significant financial investment by the Agency, which would be cost prohibitive to do so. 2.   Success Factors is solely positioned to support NASA's continued implementation and support of its product capabilities/enhancements due to their detailed knowledge of NASA's existing configuration.	This intimate knowledge has been acquired over the course of several years of maintaining the current LMS system. 3.	No other vendor has access to detailed and timely knowledge of the Success Factors LMS existing and emerging product set, especially with regard to ongoing development and product planning which directly benefits NASA's ongoing activities to improve training management throughout the Agency. Pursuant to FAR 8.404, BPAs or orders placed against Federal Supply Schedules contracts (but see 8.405-5). BPAs and orders placed against a MAS, using the procedures in this subpart, are considered to be issued using full and open competition (see 6.102(d)(3)). Therefore, when establishing a BPA (as authorized by 13.303-2(c)(3)), or placing orders under Federal Supply Schedule contracts using the procedures of 8.405, ordering activities shall not seek competition outside of the Federal Supply Schedules or synopsize at www.fedbizopps.gov within 14 days after award pursuant to FAR 8.405-6(a)(2). Pursuant to FAR 8.404(d), GSA has already determined that prices of supplies and fixed-price-services, and rates for services offered under schedule contracts to be fair and reasonable.  Therefore, ordering activities are not required to make a separate determination of fair and reasonable pricing.  However, NASA will seek additional discounts from the GSA listed prices. Market research conducted included a search of the internet and the GSA Schedules determined that no other companies are authorized by Success Factors to provide software maintenance. Success Factors does not sell their source code to Value Added Resellers (VAR), therefore competition could not be obtained and another vendor could not maintain the software.  Consequently, no other manufacturer or VAR is capable of providing this service at this time.  Due to the specialized nature of this requirement, there are no known actions which the agency may take to remove or overcome barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisitions for the services required.  Therefore, purchase of the services from Success Factors is the only practical approach. I hereby certify the facts in this justification and any supporting data used for this justification are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.
