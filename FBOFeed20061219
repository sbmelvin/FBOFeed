<SUBJECT>58--Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) Receive System
<SOLNBR>07HQSS0003
<ARCHDATE>12192007
<CONTACT>LYNDA MCCARTHY CONTRACT sPECIALIST 7036487394     ;
<DESC>Background: The Water Resources Discipline (WRD) of the USGS operates a critical real-time data collection system that provides data to support both the routine management of water-affected resources and emergency planning during extreme hydrologic events, such as flooding. The major data acquisition system that the WRD uses is the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite Data Collection System (GOES DCS), which allows data to be acquired from remote sites using the GOES satellites.  A major vulnerability to WRD's system is the GOES receive facility at Wallops Island, Virginia operated by the National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service (NESDIS) of the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA). This facility is currently a single point of failure for acquiring data from the GOES DCS for WRD and other users who either directly or indirectly receive data from this facility. Requirement: WRD is addressing this vulnerability by placing a Direct Readout Ground Station (DRGS) system at the USGS Center for Earth Observation and Science (EROS) at Sioux Falls, South Dakota.  The DRGS will receive data directly from the GOES satellites and provide an alternate source for data transmitted over the GOES satellites. NOAA/NESDIS intends to support the implementation of this system by the USGS as long as the USGS agrees to receive the entire GOES DCS data stream and allow other GOES DCS users who are also dependent on the facility at Wallops Island to acquire data from this system as an alternate source to Wallops Island.   This system will become the major part of an interagency GOES Emergency Data Distribution Network (EDDN) supported by both GOES DCS users and NOAA/NESDIS.                                                                                Finally, WRD will install a DOMSAT receiver that will acquire data from the Wallops Island facility via the DOMSAT communications satellite to provide a data feed from the Wallops Island facility to the Center for EROS.  The receiver will require the installation of a suitable antenna, which shall be a part of the procurement. Important General Requirements: The procured system is intended to operate continuously 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and should be as automated as possible, requiring minimal operator intervention.   Significant events and failures that require operator intervention should be brought to the attention of staff support via alarms and critical event messages.  All components of the system shall have the capability to be monitored and controlled both locally and remotely over a Wide Area Network (WAN).  It is anticipated that the contract will be a base year plus four one-year options for extended warranty/maintenance. This Acquisition will be made under FAR Part 15, "Contracting by Negotiation," and solicited by written Request for Proposals (RFP) No. 07HQSS0003.  It is anticipated that the RFP will be available on or about 1/08/2007 with proposals due on or about 3:00pm EST on 02/08/2007.  The RFP may be viewed/downloaded by going to www.fedbizopps.gov.  The anticipated award date is on or about 03/29/2007.  The Product Service Code is 5895 and North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 334220.  All responsible sources that have a valid Dun & Bradstreet number and are registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) may submit a proposal that shall be considered by the agency.  Offerors may register in CCR by going to www.ccr.gov.   A site visit prior to proposal submission will be scheduled (see RFP for details).  Offerors are strongly encouraged to attend.  Questions regarding this acquisition must be submitted in writing by 3:00PM EST Janaury 31, 2007 to Lynda McCarthy, Contract Specialist, either via fax 703-648-7901 or e-mail at lmccarthy@usgs.gov.  This date is subject to change depending upon date of solicitation issuance.  See RFP for details.

<SOLNBR>FA8625-07-R-6473
<ARCHDATE>03012007
<CONTACT>LaToya Brown, 937-255-2454
<DESC>The 716th Aeronautical Systems Group (716 AESG) intends to award a sole source contract to Lockheed Martin Aeronautics for Large Aircraft  Infrared Countermeasure (LAIRCM) Group A, spares for Group A hardware,  Group A interim contractor support (ICS), C-5 LAIRCM Group A/B kit  assembly, LAIRCM Kit installation, and associated over and above for the  C-5B LAIRCM.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only  one, or a limited number of sources, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 --   Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy  Agency Requirements.  This requirement will not be set-aside for small  business and will be covered under NAICS code 334511. A production and installation contract will be awarded in April 2007 for  Group A manufacture, and spares, for FY07 with annual (unpriced) options  for FY08-10, Group A/B kit assembly for FY08 with annual (unpriced)  options for FY09-11, Group A support for FY08 with annual (unpriced)  options for FY09-10, and Group A/B kit /installation for FY08.  Group A  kits, spares, and support and Group A/B assembly are for 21 aircraft.  Group B will be furnished by the Government as Government Furnished  Equipment (GFE). LMA is the developer of the C-5 LAIRCM Group A, and this development  effort will still be under way at the time of the planned Apr 07 contract  award. The Government will not possess data or reprocurement drawings for  Group A.  The LAIRCM system must integrate with all systems, subsystems,  and components of the C-5 aircraft.  LAIRCM must be installed in the  aircraft without any degradation of performance of the aircraft.  Both the  Avionics Modernization Program (AMP) and Reliability Enhancement and  Re-Engineering Program (RERP) must be considered for installation of the  LAIRCM system.  LMA is the developer of both AMP and RERP. The installation Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO), which would be  required by another potential contractor to bid on and accomplish the FY08  C-5 LAIRCM installations, will not be available at the time of contract  award and installation of the first lot of aircraft.  Lockheed Martin  Integrated Systems, who is on contract (F09603-01-D-0207-0115) to develop  the initial Group A kit and install Group A/B kit in the first aircraft,  will deliver the necessary installation TCTO in December 2007.  The  Government will verify the TCTO with the first FY08 (Lot I) aircraft  installation.  A decision will be made in FY 08 about whether to  accomplish installation of future lots organically or via a competitively  awarded contract. Because the Government plans to issue a sole source solicitation,  FA8625-07-R-6473, an additional synopsis will not be issued.  The  approximate issue date of the solicitation will be 22 Dec 06.   The  approximate response date of the solicitation will be 22 Feb 07.  This  notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. For additional information please contract LaToya Brown at Aeronautical  Systems Center, Wright Patterson Air Force Base, ATTN: LaToya Brown, 2590  Loop Road West, Building 558, Room 104, Wright Patterson AFB, OH  45433-7142, fax to 937-656-5020, or email to latoya.brown@wpafb.af.mil.

<DESC>A sole source procurement is contemplated with North American Hoganas, Inc., 111 Hoganas Way, Hollsopple, PA 15935-6416.  NAH is the only known qualified source to perform this effort.  AFRL/MNMW desires to purchase small melts (heats) of experimental steels for evaluation in the AWEF Dynamic Properties Laboratory for application to future "high speed penetrator" programs.  In order to develop and produce these more advanced steel and ensure the proper quality control requirements are met, the Government requirement mandates using the production process of (1) Electric Arc Furnace melting with Induction Stirring, (2) Ladle Refining with Argon Purging Capabilities and (3) Vacuum Degassing Treatment.  Production of the experimental steels will be in small, 5 ton increments totaling approximately 20 tons.  Market research indicates that NAH is uniquely capable of producing small melts (5 tons) to the production methods outlined above.

An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns of offerors or potential offerors.  The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program manager or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Matters of routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman, but rather to the Contracting points of contact identified above.

<DESC>1. The USSOCOM is requesting information from appropriate companies or parties currently developing manned/unmanned platforms on a) the capabilities of their platforms and b) the production capabilities of their facilities.  During the initial information gathering of this ISR RFI, request companies planning to provide a capability response identify, to the USSOCOM point of contact (POC) named below, the name of your company, address, telephone number, and name and position in the company of the individual to contact for future dialog.  Broad industry participation is desired but USSOCOM is keenly interested in designs that are currently in production or capable of rapidly entering into production (delivery of a capability within one year would be highly desired).  Details and requirements can be found on FedTeDs https://www.fedteds.gov/ under PR H92222-07-R-0008.

2.  This notice is not to be construed as an acquisition Request For Proposal (RFP), nor is any commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract implied, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted as a result of this request.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subpart 31.205-18, Independent Research and Development and Bid and Proposal Costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  No responses received will be used as a proposal.

3.  Further USSOCOM interest will be dependent on the results of the RFI capability assessment (including mission performance assessments) and USSOCOM operational requirements analyses and determinations. Potentially, future leasing or purchasing agreements may be sought to obtain platforms in order to temporarily or permanently modify them with mission and/or instrumentation equipment for more extensive evaluation. 

4.  Submissions are requested COB Monday, 22 Jan 07 and may be made by e-mail or mailing your response (response on any common computer media format) to the PCO, Kim DeBois Sousa at  deboisk@socom.mil .

5.  This notice is part of Government Market Research, a continuous process for obtaining the latest information on the ?art of the possible? from industry with respect to their current and near-term abilities.  The information collected may be used by the Government to explore future     strategies for the possible uses of platforms within the military.  Information received as a result of this request will be considered as sensitive and will be protected as such.  Any company proprietary information contained in the response shall be separately marked.   Any proprietary information received in response to this request will be properly protected from any     unauthorized disclosure.  The Government will not use proprietary information submitted from any one firm to establish the capability and requirements for any future systems acquisition, so as to not inadvertently restrict competition.

6.  U.S. and non-U.S. firms are permitted to respond to this RFI.  Responses to questions from interested parties will be promptly answered and provided equally to all interested parties unless some release of proprietary information is involved or the answer addresses a question peculiar to a Company or that Company?s response.     Currently, one-on-one information gathering sessions with respondents are not contemplated.  If one-on-one sessions with interested parties are conducted, they will be offered to all to clarify understanding of the submittal, the capability ramifications, or to discuss the form of agreement to cover any flight demonstrations.  Information feedback sessions may be offered to respondents after all qualitative assessments are completed.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for Thermal Vacuum and Thermal Testing.  The testing is to be performed on EVA Thermal Sensors to be used on STS-118 currently scheduled for mid-June 2007. NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from Swales and Associates, Inc.  Swales Aerospace was the original manufacturer of this hardware and has intimate knowledge of its unique requirements.  The thermal vacuum and thermal testing requires the testers to have an intimate understanding of the hardware in order to properly test it without damaging it or creating inaccurate results.  One of the pieces of hardware can only be used, on average, in one test before an important functional coating is worn away.  Swales Aerospace has the personnel, the training, and the facilities to perform this testing with minimal damage to the coating.  They also have the capability to properly apply the very thin coating per the precise requirements laid out in the drawings.  The personnel are also well trained in how to spot any issues with the coating that may lead to inaccurate results.  This hardware is needed for upcoming Shuttle flights.  Since the team at Swales Aerospace is already trained in all the required fields and has all the needed equipment, its schedule will allow for this hardware to meet its scheduled flight on STS-118.   The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 1:30 p.m. local time on January 4, 2007.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>Request for Proposal (RFP) For a Net-Centric Combat Identification Program Date: 15 December 2006 Contact: RDECOM, CERDEC, Intelligence and Information Warfare Directorate (I2WD), Bldg. 600, Fort Monmouth, NJ, 07703, ATTN: AMSRD-CER-IW-RC, Manny Bobbio, email: Manuel.Bobbio@us.army.mil Synopsis:  Request for Proposal (RFP) for a Net- Centric Combat Identification Program Description:  The purpose of this announcement is to request proposals for a 12-month design and development effort for a Net-centric Combat Identification (CID) capability.   Proposals should be submitted against the BAA Solicitation No., W15P7T-04-R-P008, Topic Title:  Combat ID Subtopic #1  Cooperative Target Identification. Award is not guaranteed and the Government does not intend to pay for information received.   The 12 month design and development effort for the Net-centric Combat Identification (NCCID) program will be based on state of the art Department of Defense Architecture Framework (DoDAF).  The NCCID shall provide: 	a. Technical studies, reports and recommendations to support the US Army Communications-Electronics Research Development and Development Center (CERDEC) and the Training & Doctrine Command (TRADOC) in their review per the Joint Capabilities Integration an d Development Systems (JCIDS) process. 	 b. Perform modeling and simulation experiments on selected net-centric CID systems providing contrast to current systems, including those demonstrated in the Coalition Combat Identification (CCID) Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD). 	 c. Perform a field demonstration of a net-centric integrated Combat Identification/ Command and Control/ Situational Awareness system (CID/C2/SA) for dismounted soldiers. Background. The CID Mission Area Initial Capabilities Document and the technical community at large recognize that a comprehensive CID solution requires a Family-of-Systems (FoS) solution. A comprehensive CID solution using standalone CID technologies such  as those evaluated in the CCID ACTD still has significant performance limitations while imposing a very high material and integration cost. The increasing availability and capacity of tactical and theater level networks offers the opportunity to consider and evaluate a FoS solution.  The contractor shall provide studies, reports, recommendations, and architecture products to support TRADOC's functional area analysis (FAA), functional needs analysis (FNA), functional systems analysis (FSA) and other review efforts.  The contractor shall evaluate and quantify the potential performance benefits of a net-centric CID system over the current stand-alone cooperative CID technologies in the CCID ACTD. Specific performance characteristics to be evaluated include probability o f ID, time to ID, and network loading. The evaluation shall be documented in a technical report to be submitted to CERDEC. The specific equipment configurations will be mutually agreed to by the contractor and CERDEC at a Modeling and Simulation working gr oup meeting held in conjunction with this project. The contractor shall prepare and submit a study of the performance and material advantages of integrating multiple cooperative CID technologies and situational awareness data using a net-centric approach c ontrasted with the current independent CID systems for the ground-to-ground (mounted and dismounted) domain. The study shall address key CID performance parameters (e.g. probability of identification, time to ID) material requirements, and modified/alterna tive combat ID technology. At least two candidate net-centric combat ID system solutions shall be considered. One candidate solution shall be evaluated via modeling and simulation.   The contractor shall demonstrate in a controlled field environment the feasibility and benefits of: "	A combat ID function integrated with a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA)-based Command and Control/ Situational Awareness (C2 / SA) system fo r dismounted soldiers. "	Remote CID sensors such as the vehicle mounted Battlefield Target Identification Device (BTID) and the Radio Based Combat Identification (RBCI) to provide CID function tasking of for the dismounted soldier "	Use of Service Component Architecture (SCA)-compliant radios to host CID / C2/ SA services The demonstration system shall have previously been tested in a static lab environment. For planning purposes, it can be assumed that the demonstrations will take place at Fort Dix, NJ and Fort Benning, GA.  Each demonstration will last 4 weeks.  Award is not guaranteed and the Government does not intend to pay for information received.   The evaluation criteria for scientific and technical quality of the proposal is with emphasis on feasibility of approach, performance, and completeness.  Feasibility of approach is defined as the degree with which the offeror's proposal, methods and approa ch meets the Net- Centric Combat Identification Program objectives.  The approach to meeting program milestones and schedule will be assessed.   The extent of which the offeror identifies programmatic and technical risk areas and the approach to mitigate t hese to ensure a successful program, shall be considered.  Performance is defined as the extent of which the proposed performance meets program performance and provides an operationally relevant system.  Proposed performance should be substantiated with a design concept and appropriate analysis and/or test data.  Completeness is defined as the extent to which requirements have been considered, defined, satisfied, and integrated into the offeror's overall approach.  Each proposal will be evaluated strictly i n accordance with its written content. Proposals are to be received by 16:00 EST, 19 Jan 2006. Please submit three hard copies plus one CD. You may forward responses to US Army, RDECOM, CERDEC, I2WD, Bldg. 600, Fort Monmouth, NJ, 07703, ATTN: AMSRD-CER-IW-RC (Mr. Bobbio).Acknowledgement of rece ipt will be issued.  If you choose to submit proprietary information, mark it accordingly. Classified information will be accepted by mail only, but please mark it accordingly and send it via proper channels.  Classified information can be sent to US Army,  RDECOM, CERDEC, I2WD, Bldg. 600, Fort Monmouth, NJ, 07703, ATTN: Security Office.  The inner wrapping shall be addressed to: ATTN: AMSRD-CER-IW-RC (Mr. Bobbio) Questions regarding this request can be directed to Mr. Bobbio VIA EMAIL ONLY.

<DESC>The Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD), U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Center intends to procure Mission Planning and Theater Planning Support Services to support the Special Operations Mission Planning Environment Progra m Office.  The program objective is to provide mission planning and command and control (C2) software and hardware maintenance and support to Special Operation Forces (SOF) both in garrison and deployed in the field with operational units.  The Special Ope rations Mission Planning Environment (SOMPE) program provides an integrated software suite of MISSION PLANNING, MISSION PREVIEW and MISSION EXECUTION tools to support all phases of SOF operations from deliberate to time critical.  The SOMPE program automat es TIME-SENSITIVE planning activities and provides enhanced situational awareness during MISSION EXECUTION.  SOMPE provides the interoperable environment for SOF adaptive planning to collaborate global operations including Strike, Digital Navigation, Unman ned Aerial Support Command & Control& to FIND, FIX & FINISH.  Spanning all elements of the US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), SOMPE is embedded in the Center for Special Operations (CSO), Theater Special Operations Commands (TSOCs), Joint Special Ope rations Task Force (JSOTF), Joint Special Operations Aviation Components (JSOAC), SOF warfighters and their warfighting platforms.  The SOMPE program develops, integrates, fields, trains and sustains software applications for MISSION PLANNING thru EXECUTIO N for the SOF Warfighter. The SOMPE suite of applications is fielded to all Special Operations headquarters and components, down to the team/unit levels.  The SOMPE applications are hosted on portable computers in a stand-alone configuration that are netwo rkable for Local Area Network (LAN) operations.  SOMPE is tailored to meet the specific needs of the user units and can be modified to meet geographic regional command, service, doctrinal, tactical, and information technology requirements and directives. The SOMPE core suite of applications is interoperable between components and is customized to provide platform interfaces, such as aircraft data loading.  In the case of aviation, the SOMPE must be maintained to stringent configuration management (CM) crit eria to meet safety of flight certification and avionics system interfaces per Army and Air Force guidelines.  Mission Planning Support Engineers (MPSE) and Theater Planning Support Engineers (TPSE) are required to maintain the operational readiness and av ailability of the mission planning and command and control (C2) software suite: Special Operations Mission Planning Environment (SOMPE).  The SOMPE suite of applications directly supports the missions of the Special Operations Command and improves unit rea diness and responsiveness to mission taskings, planning, and execution.  Mission and theater planning systems engineering support tasks are cross-functional and cannot be delineated per a particular Information Technology (IT) specialty.  In addition to th e cross functional expertise, each MPSE/TPSE are required to be versed in the use of the SOMPE applications to aid the units unique planning and mission criteria.   A single award Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract is anticipated with  a ceiling amount of  $40 million over five years.  The minimum order amount is $100,000.

<RESPDATE>122706
<CONTACT>Steve Manley, 202-385-8676
<DESC>This purpose of this amendment to the ADS-B SIR posed 11/30/2006 is to clarify the 3000 ft MSL coverage floor of service volume 12 in the sample problem description.  Much of the terrain in this volume rises above 3000 ft AGL.  Accordingly, the coverage floor for service volume 12 should consider the need to be 1500 feet AGL or 3000 feet MSL whichever is higher. There are no other changes to this SIR. The original SIR posting language follows:     The Federal Aviation Administration's surveillance and Broadcast Services Program Office within FAA's En Route and Oceanic Services Unit (ATO-E) announces a requirement for Surveillance and Broadcast Services (consisting of Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B), Traffic Information Service-Broadcast (TIS-B), and Flight Information Service-Broadcast (FIS-B).  The purpose of the attached Screening Information Request (SIR)is to identify vendors which are most likely to receive an ADS-B contract award.   The SIR is indentifed as Attachment 1.  A sample coverage area is identified as Attachment 2.

<CONTACT>Merwin Charles, Contract Specialist, Phone (202)874-6255, Fax (202)874-3135, Email Merwin.Charles@bep.treas.gov
<DESC>The Bureau of Engraving & Printing (BEP) is seeking a tamper evident flexible film that shall meet the performance requirements of the BEPs Specification F: SW-5 dated March 19, 2003 (Included as Attachment) for packaging cash-paks of currency notes with the following additional two requirements: For Section 3.3.8 (Tamper Evidence), in addition to the stated text, the film shall show highly visible evidence when punctured, breached or otherwise tampered with. For Section 3.4.4 ("Thickness"), the film  shall be significantly thinner (0.002-0.005 inches ideally) than the current film in use ( 0.010 inches) with no loss of specified performance properties or end-use functionality, particularly with no loss in strength properties, and without varying + 10% from the offerors declaration of manufacturing thickness. A sample of our current production film is available upon request,however, our current film does not meet the new performance requirements as stated above..  Interested parties who want to participate in this effort shall submit a technical description and technical data sheet of their film along with a sample for BEP review.  The BEP will work with the vendor in a collaborative effort to determine if the film meets the BEPs requirements through practical trials of the film on BEP equipment as warranted.   The technical description and sample (approximately 3 square feet) should be sent to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, Attn: Office of Materials Technology, Dr. John F. Bobalek, Room 201-29A, 14th & C Sts., S.W., Washington, D.C.  20228.  The technical data sheet should contain at minimum the following properties of the film:  Impact Resistance ASTM D 1709, Tensile Strength ASTM D 638, Elongation ASTM D 638, Tear Propagation ASTM D 1922, Abrasion ASTM D 4157, Seal Initiation and Strength ASTM F 88, Hot Tack ASTM F 1921-98, and Shrinkability (in both the machine and transverse directions). If you have any questions, please contact Merwin Charles via fax at (202) 874-3135 or e-mail at merwin.charles@bep.treas.gov. Telephone inquiries are strongly discouraged. Interested parties are encouraged to register at FedBizOpps (www.fedbizopps.gov ) for electronic notification of issuance of any amendments or changes to this notice.

Question responses;

1. Is there a deadline for submissions? Answer: There is no deadline for the submission of samples.  However, the BEP desires to implement this new cash-pak film as soon as possible and therefore it would be in the vendor?s best interest to submit their sample as soon as possible.   

2. Can you elaborate about your request for tamper evidence? Does this refer only to the heat-sealed areas of the film or are you seeking something that would provide tamper evidence for the entire surface of the material? This makes a good deal of difference in the manner that we undertake an innovation. Answer: Please see attachment

3. Please clarify the following.  
Annual quantity usage for each film: Currently Unknown 
6 types of film is being asked for, is it ok that we first produce the first 2 films and when 100% satisfaction is reached we will then continue with the rest 4. Answer: Only one type of film is being asked for. 

4. Would you please provide me more information on the current film physical properties so that we can have a better understanding of what film to recommend?  I believe the down-gauged film solution could be provided relatively quickly by Pliant however, the tamper evident solution would take some development time.  Also what is the timing for submitting a proposal for this development work? Answer: As per your inquiry, the Sources Sought Announcement is specific to only one type of film.  This film is used for packaging cash-paks.  The cash-pak film comes in various colors.  The estimated annual usage of cash-pak films is approximately 1.52 million linear feet (film width of 40 inches). Answer: Ideally, the BEP is seeking a film that will indicate a breach anywhere in the film.  We want to be able to detect visually if the film has been breached to gain entry into the cash-pak.  However, the BEP is willing to consider other ideas of tamper evidence such as tamper evidence of the sealed areas and would welcome a submission for consideration.

 5. I would like to request a sample of Solicitation#BEP-07-SS001.
What is the difference between the sample and current specifications?
Kindly advise where I can obtain a copy of the complete specifications. Answer: Please see attachment

(10) December 8/December 15
(17).    The Department of Engineering Mechanics has a requirement for the procurement of a scanning vibrating probe system to monitor electrochemical cells in aluminum alloys to understand the corrosion kinetics in aging aircraft structures.  We currently do not have any system to monitor the corrosion potentials and corrosion current path in aluminum alloys.  This equipment will enhance our capability to monitor corrosion in high strength aluminum alloys.  Corrosion of aging aircraft is a widespread problem in the Air Force?s fleet.  This equipment will add a new dimension to cadet curriculum and USAFA?s research by demonstrating the creation of electrochemical cells in aluminum alloys in a liquid electrolyte. Quantification of the current and its path will help us determine the kinetics of the reaction.  This instrument will become an integral part of corrosion demonstration for cadets of EM350, EM445 and EM460 classes.  This will also enable us to develop scientific basis for establishing inspection intervals to monitor corrosion in aging aircrafts.  

We are interested in procuring Model SVP100 system consisting of model SVP370 probe, model ECW370 system controller, model 283 potentiostat/galvanostat, GPIB connector and software from Princeton Applied Research, because of the state of the art instrumentation and controls available in this system.  However any equivalent or better system meeting the following specs will help the Academy accomplish its mission:
 
The scanning vibrating probe equipment should consist of the general capabilities:
?	Be modular in design.
?	Be able to measure the electrochemical activity on specimen non intrusively.
?	Must be completely automated with connections to potentiostat/galvanostat and control computer.

Specific technical requirements are:
?	SVP unit with: 
o	Minimum scanning capability of 12? X 12? in X-Y direction with at least 1 inch travel in z direction.
o	Probe resolution of at least 1 micron.
o	Vibration amplitude of 50 microns or higher.
o	Scanning speed of at least 1mm/sec.
o	Minimum electrochemical sensitivity of 5 ??A/cm2.
o	Lock-in amplifier with amplification of up to 100,000.
o	Minimum SVGA resolution of 800 X 600.

?	Potentiostat/Galvanostat:
o	Fully computer controlled.
o	Minimum sensitivity of 1 pA and 2mV.
o	Scan range of at least 12V and 100 mA.
o	Built in IR compensation.
o	Computer system and related hardware to control the two systems simultaneously.
A  52.211-6 Brand Name or Equal acquisition will be conducted.  The NAICS for this acquisition is 334519 and the size standard is 500 employees.  Women owned and small disadvantaged businesses are encouraged to submit offers.   This acquisition is set aside 100% for small business enterprises.  The solicitation will be electronically available through this web site.

<SOLNBR>HQ0006-06-MSTAR-BAA
<RESPDATE>011207
<ARCHDATE>01272007
<CONTACT>Jim Kelly, Contract Specialist, Phone (703) 882-6634, Fax (703) 882-6356, Email Jim.Kelly@mda.mil
<DESC>THE PURPOSE OF THIS MODIFICATION IS TO EXTEND THE RESPONSE DATE TO FRIDAY, JANUARY 12, 2007 FROM FRIDAY, DECEMBER 29, 2006.     THIS MSTAR BAA IS REISSUED IN ITS ENTIRETY.     THIS IS HQ0006-06-MSTAR-BAA MODIFICATION 03. 

The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) is charged with developing and fielding a Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) to protect the United States, US allies and friends from ballistic missile attack. The Ballistic Missile Defense layered approach includes sensors, kinetic energy systems, directed energy systems, battle management, and command control elements that will engage threat missiles in all phases of flight, from Boost Phase through Midcourse and into Terminal Phase.  

MDA efforts will make the BMDS more robust against the widening threats, and able to handle a broad range of unknown missiles, warheads, trajectories, and adversaries.  In addition, the BMDS must function without extensive detailed a-priori knowledge of our adversary?s systems.  Wherever adversaries launch, to whatever target they choose, MDA must be able to detect, track, identify and kill the ballistic missile.

In support of these efforts, MDA programs are geared towards advancing technological thresholds in hardware and software, through fundamental scientific breakthroughs in areas such as mathematics, physics, and engineering.  This push is essential to the strategy of spiral development with Block improvements in the BMDS every two years.  

MDA advances technology that enables near-term, evolutionary growth in current systems while adding revolutionary systems to substantially improve the BMDS in the far term.  The MDA Advanced Technology Deputate (DV) is responsible for developing advanced capabilities for the BMDS. This includes planning and executing a broad range of enabling and advanced technology development efforts, developing the technology base for advanced BMDS Blocks, assessing emerging technologies, innovative concepts, and leading the effort to develop advanced algorithms for improving BMDS capability.
  
MDA/DV has instituted the Missile Defense Science, Technology And Research (MSTAR) Program in order to sponsor fundamental, BMDS relevant research and development at accredited United States universities and academic institutions as well as to support training of future scientists and engineers in the field of missile defense.  The MSTAR Program, administered by MDA/DV, is designed to identify and develop new and innovative concepts, stimulate technology innovation, and exploit breakthroughs in science to offer robust technology improvements to all elements of the BMDS.  MSTAR is a competitive, science and technology university research program, which consists of forefront research and development technology, concepts, and approaches acquired through scientific and technological investigation.

Request for Information (RFI) #1
Date:  16 November 2006


THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE.  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY.  This RFI is issued for the purpose of developing a viable solicitation that will best communicate the Government's requirements to industry. Response to this RFI is strictly voluntary and will not affect any corporation's ability to submit an offer if and when a solicitation is released. There is no bid package or solicitation document associated with this announcement. The requested information is for planning purposes and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued. No entitlement to payment by the Government of direct or indirect costs or charges will arise as a result of the submission of contractors' information. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations.

GENERAL INFORMATION.  The Air Force Center for Environmental Excellence (AFCEE), Brooks City-Base, TX, is planning to contract with Architect-Engineer (A&E) firms to perform worldwide Title I, Title II, and other A&E services to administer, coordinate, and technically support Environmental, Military Family Housing (MFH), Military Construction (MILCON), and Sustainment, Restoration and Maintenance (SRM) programs of interest to the government.  We anticipate multiple award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts using NAICS code 562910.  The small business size standard associated with this NAICS code is 500 employees.    We currently anticipate awarding approximately 15-20 contracts to large and small businesses.  All sub-categories of small businesses are being looked at during our market research phase.  At this time, we are considering that task orders under these contracts will be negotiated as either Time & Materials (T&M) or Firm Fixed Price (FFP) depending on the nature of the requirement.  Additionally, we currently anticipate that each contract will have a basic ordering period of five (5) years with three additional years for performance.  Central Contract Registration (CCR) will be mandatory for these contracts (see CCR website at www.ccr.gov).

BACKGROUND AND PROGRAM INFORMATION.  These IDIQ contracts will serve to functionally replace and expand services contained within AFCEE?s existing Worldwide Planning, Program, and Design (4P A-E) contracts whose current ordering period will expire during the Jan - Jun 2008 timeframe.  In general, the existing 4P A-E SOW scope remains applicable to services contemplated for the future.  However, scope modifications are contemplated in the following areas:
	
?	Expanded MFH Title I and II Services
?	Expanded MILCON Title I and II Services
?	New/expanded SRM Title I and II Services
?	Continued General Information Management System Support Services (however, will eliminate procurement of Information Technology Systems)

ANTICIPATED GENERAL SCOPE OF SERVICES
To provide Title I, Title II, and Other A-E Services for environmental and traditional (Housing, MILCON, and SRM) projects.  The anticipated scope includes support in the following existing and emerging program areas:

?	Title I Services:  Title I services include all aspects of design such as preparation and/or review of contract plans, specifications, scheduling, cost estimates, building commissioning services and preparation of operating and design manuals.  Title I efforts also encompass those efforts required to support and develop design work, including planning and programming, program management, project scoping, studies, investigations, evaluations, consultations, conceptual design, value engineering, and operation, monitoring, topographic survey services, and optimization of environmental treatment or control systems
 
?	Title II Services:  Title II services include all aspects of construction quality assurance and oversight of environmental and facility construction projects

?	Environmental Restoration:  Support the Environmental Restoration mission.  Major activities supported include A&E support for remedial investigation, remedial design, long-term maintenance operations, and long-term monitoring (LTM). Interim remedial actions (IRAs) may be infrequently required to reduce or limit an immediate threat to human health or the environment.   In addition, support includes technical oversight of environmental programs, laboratory quality assurance assessments, document reviews, and assistance in selecting remediation technologies

?	Environmental Conservation and Planning:  Support the Environmental Conservation and Planning mission.  Major activities supported include A&E support on the Environmental Impact Analysis Process (EIAP), natural infrastructure assessment and management, environmental management, natural and cultural resource programs, and comprehensive planning programs.  In addition, support environmental impact statements, baseline surveys, forestry, wildlife, archeology, Native American consultations, transportation, air space and range management, and noise programs

?	Environmental Quality:  Support the Environmental Quality mission.  Major activities supported include A&E support for compliance and pollution-prevention programs, environmental education and training, sustainable development, environmental management systems, and the Environmental Compliance Assessment and Management Program (ECAMP) 

?	Design and Construction:  Support the Design and Construction mission.  Major activities supported include A&E support related to standards, criteria and publications development, facility design, construction management, building commissioning, LEED analysis, interior design, landscape architecture, the Military Family Housing (MFH) and MFH Privatization program.  Also, support the development, testing, and documentation of new project management acquisition and construction methodologies   

?	Plans and Programs:  Major activities may include A&E support for defining housing market areas, detailed market research and analysis, development of housing requirements, pre-planning studies, detailed inspections and assessments of existing family housing and dormitories, development of programming guides for project scoping and the development of housing and dormitory investment strategies that integrate and prioritize, traditional housing construction and operations and maintenance (O&M) funding with private sector financing  

?	Other Areas of Support and Emerging Markets:  Support AFCEE with other areas of support and emerging markets.  Additional activities may include A&E support on Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) fuel facilities, unexploded ordnance (UXO), force protection, sustainable design, general information management system support services, and project delivery methods 

The final decision for inclusion of any requirements has not been made.

The amended SIR is also posted with an initial posting date of 11/30/06.  The language reads a follows: This purpose of this amendment to the ADS-B SIR posed 11/30/2006 is to clarify the 3000 ft MSL coverage floor of service volume 12 in the sample problem description.  Much of the terrain in this volume rises above 3000 ft AGL.  Accordingly, the coverage floor for service volume 12 should consider the need to be 1500 feet AGL or 3000 feet MSL whichever is higher.

<DESC>The Great Lakes Acquisition Center (GLAC) intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Radisson Hotel La Crosse, La Crosse, WI to provide hotel and conference space accommodations for the 2010 National Veterans Creative Arts Festival to be held in La Crosse, Wisconsin.  The Arts Festival event will occur during the week of October 17 through the 24, 2010.  The VAMC in Tomah Wisconsin is hosting this 2010 National Veterans Creative Arts Festival and to the best of our knowledge the Radisson Hotel     La Crosse is the only hotel who is capable of providing a minimum of 12 handicapped accessible and a minimum of 115 standard sleeping rooms per night. The conference room space requirements the hotel will be providing is 1 conference room with a minimum 3,000 square feet, 4 conference rooms with a minimum 1,000 square feet, 3 conference rooms with a minimum 700 square feet and 3 conference rooms with a minimum 600 square feet. All floors and conference room space must be wheelchair accessible.  As the host site, Tomah VAMC will be providing medical care and support for all the participants during the art festival; therefore, the hotel and conference accommodations must be within close proximity of each other and within 50 miles of the Tomah VAMC. The hotel facility must be FEMA approved and listed on the U.S. Fire Administration Hotel and Motel National Master List found at http://www.usfa.fema.gov/hotel/search.cfm.  The hotel facility must also be compliant with the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (Public Law 101-366) (42U.S. C. 12101 et. Seq.). The (NAICS) North American Industry Classification System code is 721110.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. No solicitation documents are available and telephone requests will not be accepted. However, any firm that believes it can meet the requirements may give written notification to the Contracting Office within (seven) 7 calendar days from the date of publication of this synopsis. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail, to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements.  Information can be sent to: Great Lakes Acquisition Center, Bldg 5, Attn Kevin Baier, 5000 W. National Avenue, Milwaukee, WI 53295 or via fax 414-904-5440. Responses received will be evaluated, however; a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received, the GLAC will proceed with the sole source negotiation with the Radisson Hotel La Crosse, La Crosse, WI.

Capable sources are sought to focus on enabling the Air Force mission to maintain and improve DoD Intelligence capabilities. The objective of this effort is to conduct Joint Enterprise Department of Defense Intelligence Information Systems Infrastructure (JEDI) software development and Department of Defense Intelligence Information Systems (DODIIS) Trusted Workstation (DTW) development, integration, and system support for the Air Force Command and Control Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance Center (AFC2ISRC/A-26), the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), and the DoDIIS community. The approach is to provide engineering and technical expertise to include requirements definition analysis, systems engineering, development, integration management, quality control, familiarization, integration/interoperability testing, security, and system operation and administration.  In the course of performance, personnel will interface with agencies at various DODIIS and U.S. Intelligence Community sites worldwide through both visits and electronic means. In addition, one full-time on-site DTW engineer will be required at Rome Research Site, US CENTCOM, DIA, and US NORTHCOM. The contract will result in the delivery of several software releases (approximately one release every six months) to the JEDI/DTW user community, to include computer software, technical documentation, and the installation and maintenance of the current systems on a "as required" basis.

An indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity cost-plus-fixed-fee (completion) type contract is contemplated with an ordering period of 60 months. The maximum contemplated ordering amount is anticipated to be approximately $49,900,000.00.

<DESC>Background: The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) is one of 27 Institutes and Centers of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which is a component of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS).  The mission of the NIEHS is to reduce the burden of human illness and disability by understanding how the environment influences the development and progression of human disease. To have the greatest impact on preventing disease and improving human health, the NIEHS focuses on basic science, disease-oriented research, global environmental health, and multidisciplinary training for researchers.

LOCATION:  NIEHS is located on 375 rolling acres of rhododendron, oak and pine in Research Triangle Park (RTP). RTP, a science and technology hub was created by the state of North Carolina between Raleigh, Durham and Chapel Hill. 

Objective: The purpose of this RFI is to determine potential sources to acquire capable and qualified contractor to perform preventive and emergency maintenance, repair, inspection, installation, and relocation of Security Surveillance Equipment and supply, place, and remove covert equipment as required at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. 
 
Capability Statement:  independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish all necessary services and qualified technical personnel, not otherwise provided by the Government.  The Contractor shall provide complete mechanical and electrical preventive maintenance, emergency maintenance response including necessary repair service, inspections, relocations, and installations, including covert equipment, shall be provided by the Contractor for Government-owned Security Surveillance Equipment consistent with commercial industry standards.

The surveillance equipment to be covered by this Contract has been under continuous maintenance following the expiration of the respective warranties. The equipment has been operable for a number of years and requires continuous maintenance and repairs. The enhancement of the equipment will include equipment replacement as part of the Institute's security upgrade. As each task is completed the Contract will be modified and the maintenance added.  A preventive maintenance schedule will be added for any additional cameras or equipment that requires maintenance biannually.
The scope includes the contractor to provide, install, monitor, and remove covert type surveillance equipment at times when the Government has the necessity to prevent theft, possible threats, or destruction of Government property. The Contractor shall provide the latest type of covert surveillance equipment. The Contractor shall be able to install this type of equipment within four hours of notice. The Contractor and the Contracting Officer will agree upon a one time price prior to installation. Once the covert type surveillance equipment is installed the Security Contractor or the Government will monitor the equipment. When this covert task is over the Contractor will be asked to remove the surveillance equipment. 
All outside pole cameras are located on 30' aluminum poles, these poles will not support the weight of an extension ladder and a person. The contractor will need a mechanical type lift or a boom truck in order to work these outside cameras including for emergency repairs in the time requirements of the Contract.

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is issued for informational and planning purpose only. Please note that the Air Force will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this request for information. In accordance with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular Number A-76 dated May 29, 2003, the United States Air Force, Air Mobility Command (AMC) is in the process of conducting Preliminary Planning, which includes Market Research, for the Metals Technology function at the following Air Mobility Command (AMC) location: Charleston AFB, Dover AFB, DE; Fairchild AFB, WA; Grand Forks AFB, ND; MacDill AFB,FL; McChord, AFB WA; McGuire, AFB NJ; Robins, AFB GA; Travis, AFB CA. Metals Technology is responsible repairing equipment on and off airplanes; advises on machining, welding, designing and production related problems. Designs manufactures, or modifies special precision tools, gauges, dies, and fixtures to facilitate metal working operations. Interprets blueprints and shop drawings. Welds, brazes, solders, and heat treats metals.

The Metal Technology performance requirements are as follows:

A.	Provide qualified personnel, equipment, tools, materials, supervision, and other items and services necessary ( except government furnished) ensure the Air Mobility Command (AMC) Directorate of Logistics is provided with professional metal fabrication, and welding requirements.

B.	Process AFTO 350, 781A, 244 and Repairable tags for on and off equipment.

C.	Aircraft Support Equipment/AGE (powered/nonpowered) through inspections, welding repairs and replaces components.

D.	Performs required in-shop equipment maintenance through inspections and operation of tools and perform equipment lockout/tag out procedures.

F.	Support and comply with the maintenance Foreign Object and Damage control program.

G.	Maintain Technical Publications and machine manuals for technical data, changes, and supplements, and inventory files service.

H.	Maintain certification level and document welding certificates.

I.	Communicate with appropriate engineering authority for repair maintenance outside the scope of Technical Publications.

The information gathered from this RFI will be used, along with other information; to determine both private sector interest and the competition parameters should AMC decide that metals technology is a viable candidate for an A-76 public-private competition. The information requested by this synopsis will be used within the Air Force to facilitate decision-making and will not be disclosed outside the agency. Should a future requirement evolve from this preliminary planning process, it is anticipated that the period of performance will be a base year plus four one-year option periods. For purpose of this synopsis the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 488190 and the small business size standard is $6.5M. AMC requests any qualified businesses capable and potentially interested in performing metals technology services reply to this RFI stating their interest and submit a capability package to include the following information: 1) name and address of company; 2) company point of contact including telephone, fax, and email address; 3) identify business size (large, small, disadvantaged, women-owned, 8(a), HUB Zone, etc; and 4) information demonstrating the company?s ability to perform the potential requirement as described above. In addition, we request that capability packages include your current and past performance contract references relating to metal technology services to include: contract number; agency or organization supported; whether or not contractor was a prime or a subcontractor; period of performance; original, current, and total contract value; POC (customer?s technical monitor) with current telephone, fax number and email address; and a brief description of the effort.

<DESC>Sources Sought: The U.S. Army Natick Soldier RDEC has a need to identify commercially available socks for potential use as a replacement for the socks currently used as a dress sock and a sock liner. The socks will be evaluated for use in a potential  future user test. NO SOLICITATION CURRENTLY EXISTS. The socks must be produced in the U.S of U.S. made fibers, but the Government is not mandating the type of fibers nor the weight of the socks. The only absolute requirements are: the socks shall meet or exceed the current requirements of the existing socks and be equal to or less in cost. Cost will be a determining factor. The socks should contain compression technology, have the capability for moisture management, and reduce/prevent odor and athletes fo ot. These properties shall last for a minimum of 50 launderings. Companies interested in having their socks evaluated for possible future use must submit 6 pair (for testing purposes), along with an information paper (specification sheet) describing the so cks, to include such things as sock name, place of manufacture, location of source of fibers, blend of fibers, pricing information (cost per pair), any in-house testing data that is available and any other information that the company feels appropriate. Th e samples and information paper must be submitted no later than 28 February 2007 to Ms. Beverly Kimball, US Army Research Development & Engineering Command, Natick Soldier RDEC, ATTN: AMSRD-NSC-IP-A, Room D-242, Kansas Street, Natick, MA 01760-5019.

<DESC>Notice of Proposed Contract Actions IAW FAR 12 and 13 Posted 19 December 2006 through 28 December 2006 This announcement is notice of intent to award a sole source purchase order in accordance with FAR 6.302-1.  The item to be purchased as a sole source is for the procurement of a third of three hydraulic cylinders for the R.D. Willis Powerplant, Texas. The procurement will be an addition to the current equipment that is in place, as provided by West Craft Manufac turing. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code 332721 business size standard is 500 employees.     The sole source contractor is West Craft Manufacturing, Inc. 100 Mill Pond Road, Alto, Texas 75925-0596.  The sole source purchase is for a hydraulic cylinder (one each) for the power plant. The procurement is an approved sole source because the current dr awings of existing cylinders located in the power plant are owned by West Craft Manufacturing, Inc. who will not release the drawings to the general public or the Government of the previously manufactured cylinders, because the inforamtion is considered pr oprietary to the West Craft company.  Additionally, in order to ensure the proper operation of the plant equipment the cylinder (e.g., no leakage or other operability problems) must be purchased from the original manufacturer to ensure proper turnkey ope ration with the other two cylinders that are currently in place, as installed by West Craft Manufacturing.  Failure of complete integration into existing equipment at the power plant of the cylinder to be purchased hereunder, could lead to substantial equi pment malfunction and a substantial duplication of cost to the Government. Any contractors who believe that they have the capability to meet the listed qualifications may submit, for consideration by the Government, a statement of capability which shall include the proposed compliance with the requirements that contribute to this  sole source procurement. Comments are due by 28 December 2006, at Noon (CST), however the posting will remain for a period of not less than ten days.  If no comments are received by the closing date, a purchase order will be issued to the above named sole  source. Please refer any questions to Sheila R. Garrett, Contract Specialist, at sheila.garrett@swf02.usace.army.mil. NO PHONE CALLS PLEASE.

<SUBJECT>R -- Intelligent Transportation System Program Support
<DESC>It is anticipated that this will be a SOLE-SOURCE procurement resulting in a SOLE-SOURCE contract.  The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) plans to award one and only one contract, to the Intelligent Transportation Society of America (ITSA), on a SOLE-SOURCE basis.  It is anticipated that the SOLE-SOURCE award to ITSA will be in the form of an Indefinite Delivery / Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) task order contract, and that each particular task order, which will be issued to ITSA on a SOLE-SOURCE basis, will be cost-plus-fixed-fee.  It is estimated that ITSA?s resulting SOLE-SOURCE contract will have a two-year base period and three option years.  Under ITSA?s SOLE-SOURCE contract, ITSA will perform a series of activities designed to support the FHWA?s Intelligent Transportation Systems Joint Program Office (ITS/JPO) in meeting current and future challenges, including surface transportation management and operations.   In performing this SOLE-SOURCE contract, ITSA will be responsible for all aspects of the development and documentation of work and interaction with the stakeholder community.  As a part of that undertaking ITSA will also provide program management.  ITSA will set up and conduct workshops and stakeholder meetings and will conduct special studies regarding the ITS program.  For the following reasons among others, ITSA alone is considered to be uniquely qualified to perform this SOLE-SOURCE contract.  ITSA was formed specifically to create a bridge between the electronics industry and the transportation communities.  ITSA provides the only venue of its type for the discussion and guidance of the ITS program based upon its diverse membership.  ITSA is a non-profit, national association with over 600 members representing state and local government, the private sector and academia.  ITSA is the national organization dedicated to Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS).  Most private sector companies that produce ITS products and services, as well as the public sector users of those products and services, are members of ITSA.  Thus ITSA is the only venue where the public and private sectors are co-mingled to allow their combined viewpoints and knowledge to be brought to bear on ITS issues and problems.  Because of ITSA?s access to people and organizations needed for this project, and because its members alone possess all of the specialized technical expertise needed for the contract here envisioned, ITSA is uniquely qualified to successfully perform the activities contemplated herein.  Moreover, ITSA has an organization of established technical committees, forums, and programs that parallel the activities of the ITS JPO program.  The public and private organizations that would benefit from the products of this contract are part of ITSA?s membership and include those responsible for managing, designing, implementing, and maintaining transportation systems.  One of the primary strengths of ITSA is its ability to draw upon volunteer resources to blend experience from the public and private sectors.  Transportation professionals donate their time to serve on ITSA-sponsored forums, committees, and other groups that will play a part in the success of this project.  ITSA has 26 state chapters that provide a venue to reach the grass-roots deployers of ITS technology and to provide access to literally thousands of transportation professionals.  If, despite the existence of the above-mentioned overwhelming factual basis logically favoring ITSA as the only organization capable of satisfactorily executing the contract envisioned herein, any organization OTHER THAN ITSA believes that it can perform this project, then any such other organization shall submit one HARD-paper original and 10 HARD-paper copies of a complete Statement of Qualifications to the following address NOT LATER THAN 4:15 PM Eastern Standard Time on January 10, 2007:  Mr. James Mowery, Negotiator, Office of Acquisition Management (HAAM30-D), Federal Highway Administration, Room 4410, 400 Seventh Street, S. W., Washington, D. C. 20590.   E-mailed, faxed, and telephonically transmitted Statements of Qualifications will NOT be accepted.   It is estimated that the total value of this project ultimately will fall somewhere within the range of ten million to twenty million dollars.

<DESC>Notice of Contract Action for a Sole Source Procurement for POSS-Polyimides. Edwards Air Force Base, CA intends to award a Sole Source purchase order to Dr. Timothy Minton, 108 Gains Hall, Montana State University, Bozeman,  MT 59717 for research and testing on the effects of atomic oxygen (AO) and Ultraviolet (UV) light on POSS (Polyhedral Oligomericsilsesquioxane)-polyimide (PI) films.  This work will include the exposure of at least 3 batches of POSS PI films up to 8 samples per batch to a well characterized AO source with AO flux and vacuum conditions representative of the low Earth orbit (LEO) environment with the erosion yield characterization and XPS data for up to 16 types of samples. Up to 16 1 by 1.5 in samples, and up to four 2 by 3 inch samples will be exposed to AO and UV.  Besides an AO source, the utilized vacuum chamber must also have an UV/VUV source and a sample holder that can maintain various temperatures comparable to the space environment.  Previous AO source characterization must be completed showing near 70% atomic oxygen with known translational energies of approximately 5 eV. Previous work in determining erosion yields due to AO exposure, atomic force microscopy imaging of samples after AO exposure, and X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy must be referenced.  Due to the volume of samples to be studied over a 4.5 month period, experience in AO exposure of polyimide film materials and subsequent characterization is required.

<SUBJECT>U -- Title I Educational Support Services
<DESC>Title I, Part A, of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), as amended by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (P.L. 107-110), provides Federal financial assistance to Local Educational Agencies (LEAs) to ensure that all children have fair, equal, and significant opportunities in obtaining high-quality education and reach, at a minimum, proficiency on challenging State academic achievement standards and State academic assessments.  Accordingly, Sec. 1120 of the ESEA requires each participating LEA to provide Title I services to eligible private school children, their teachers, and their families.  These services must be equitable to those provided by each LEA to public school children, their teachers, and their families. 

If an LEA is prohibited by law from providing equitable services to private school children in accordance with Sec. 1120 of the ESEA or if the U.S. Secretary of Education determines that an LEA has substantially failed or is unwilling to provide such services to private school children, that LEA is "bypassed."  The Security of Education has waived this requirement to date for 57 LEAs in the State of Missouri and 14 LEAs in Virginia and has arranged for third parties under contracts with the U.S. Department of Education (ED) to provide these required services.  The Department of Education will be awarding two separate contracts (one  award for Missouri LEA services and one contract for Virginia LEA services) however, parties responding to this Request for Information (RFI) must be aware of their duties for assuming the LEA's responsibility in meeting all statuatory and regulatory requirements for providing equitable services.

At a minimum, the contractor shall have the capacity to:

* Conduct timely and applicable consultation with appropriate private school officials prior to making any decisions;

* Collect poverty data using scientifically-based research methods allowed under Sec. 1120 of NCLB;

* Determine the amount of funds generated by low-income private school children that will be used to provide instruction by each private school;

* Decide whether or not to combine available funding (see B-17 on page 16 of the Guidance);

* Determine the multiple, educationally related, objective criteria used to select eligible children (see Sec. 1115 (b) of NCLB):

* Select for services children most at-risk of failing who live in participating public school attendance areas;

* Determine the educational need of participants based on the collected student data;

* Design and implement scientifically-researched based curricula and instructional programs that meet the needs of participants and are coordinated with instruction occurring in the regular classrooms;

* Assess the annual progress of the Title I programs toward meeting standards established in consultation;

* Revise Title I services to meet goals as described in the initial consultation with private school officials if progress is not being made;

* Provide instruction by teachers who meet the specified State's definition of "highly qualified teacher";

* Compensate teachers (salaries and benefits) at a rate equal to the schedules for public school teachers in the LEA where the program is located;

* Provide private school teachers of participants and contractor teachers with professional development activities to provide the necessary knowledge and skills in better serving the participants; and

<DESC>1. STATEMENT OF DUTIES

A.  GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CONTRACTOR

BACKGROUND:	This position is located in the U.S. Embassy/Narcotics Affairs Section (NAS), Narcotics Control Office, Lima, Peru. The NAS Narcotics Control Office is the liaison between NAS and the Government of Peru?s coca eradication program.  Coca eradication is handled by CORAH (Control y Reduccion de Coca Alto Huallaga), which falls under the Minister of Interior but is fully funded by NAS in the amount of just over $11 million US.  The NCO, with the help of NAS Accounting, oversees the use of that money, final approval control resting with the NCO.  NCO also advises CORAH on strategy and tactics in the field, coordinates eradication support provided by the NAS Aviation and Police programs, and oversees and supports all CORAH logistics, financial management and administration activities.  The NCO is made up of the Narcotics Control Officer, the Eradication Operations Advisor and an Executive Administrator.  

PURPOSE:  The purpose of this professional services contract position is to provide an Eradication Operations Advisor (EOA) to the NAS/NCO coca eradication support program. The incumbent serves as the field advisor to the NAS Narcotics Control Officer (NCO) on all programmed and voluntary eradication activities.  The advisor coordinates programmed eradication operations with CORAH, the Government of Peru/Ministry of the Interior eradication organization.  As required, the advisor coordinates the measuring and monitoring of coca (CADA), the licit crop activities of ICT, CORAH construction projects, NAS administrative matters, and logistical support.  The position requires problem solving, communication, and human relations abilities.  A key responsibility of the EOA is to maintain currency on all NCO activities and stand in for the NCO as needed. 

SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:	The incumbent works under the direct supervision of the Narcotics Control Officer; however, the individual exercises wide latitude for independent action, initiating projects and executing approved new programs under general supervision.  The incumbent may coordinate directly with the NAS front office and other US Embassy and GOP agencies for purposes of this program.  Completed work is reviewed for security achieved and effectiveness. 	

2. STATEMENT OF WORK

In the absence of the NCO, the EOA assumes functions of the NCO.  Since this is the case the Deputy must apprise himself of all programs, plans, and operations that may involve the NCO. The major areas of responsibility include, but are not limited to, the following:

A. OVERALL RESPONSIBILITIES

The EOA is intricately involved in eradication policy development, approval and implementation.  The advisor provides the NCO information on all matters related to eradication operations by providing field information, documentation and talking points.  Along with the NCO, the EOA represents NAS and USG in policy discussions with host government and other counter-narcotic (CN) agencies related to eradication, interdiction, monitoring and alternative development.

Along with the Narcotics Control Officer, the EOA coordinates the host government approval process of annual eradication work plans with high level GOP officials.

B. STRATEGY AND PLANNING RESPONSIBILITIES

The EOA provides input to the development of US Embassy yearly eradication strategy and goals.  Along with the NCO, the EOA develops goals, objectives and budgets for each project (CORAH, CADA) in accordance with the Mission Program Plan.  In close coordination with CORAH field officers, the EOA develops long-term, short-term and contingency plans of operations for the eradication.

The EOA meets as necessary with NAS program officers and other Mission personnel to coordinate the implementation and monitoring of eradication operations and illicit crop measurement.  In addition, the EOA provides advice and input directly to CORAH, CADA and ICT in the preparation of their annual work plan.
  
C. IMPLEMENTATION AND OPERATIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES

The EOA assists CORAH in development of specific eradication plans linked directly to the US Embassy MPPs. The advisor advises on operational strategies based on personal knowledge of specific geographic zones, socio-political influences, and threat conditions.  The EOA conducts field-level liaison and coordination concerning eradication operations with officials of the host government (police, police aviation, officers and enlisted personnel) and other USG agencies.  Also, the EOA oversees implementation of eradication plans, advises counterparts on efficient operational methodology, evaluates effectiveness of those operations from the field, and adapts plans and redirects use of resources as required by changing situations.

The advisor assists counterparts during selection, installation and maintenance of forward base locations, providing a forward NAS presence during eradication operations to monitor and advise Narcotics Control Officer of advances and/or potential problem areas.  In addition, the EOA and CORAH Field Director develop organizational and procedural manuals to document and implement standardized procedures during eradication operations.

D. SECURITY RESPONSIBILITIES

The EOA must consider all security risks while planning eradication operations and constantly assesses security during active eradication operations, notifying CORAH, the NCO, and cooperating USG and GOP agencies about threat levels.

The EOA is responsible for overseeing the implementation of all operational, communications and personnel security programs.

E. LOGISTICS RESPONSIBILITIES

The EOA conducts needs assessments for field operations, defining commodity procurement and replacement requirements.  The advisor, as well as the NCO, approves purchases to support eradication operations based on needs and budget allocations. Another responsibility is to monitor the procurement process to ensure purchased items are received in a timely manner and that the goods meet specification requirements. 

F. TRAINING RESPONSIBILITIES

The advisor conducts training needs assessments to improve the efficiency of eradication operations, including the conducting of training to develop leadership skills for supervisory personnel and various subject matter training as required. Also, the EOA monitors others as they train using organizational and procedural manuals; performance evaluation is also a responsibility.

G. MONITORING AND EVALUATION RESPONSIBILITIES

While in the field, the advisor must monitor all CORAH/CADA field issues and activities to ensure compliance with all established policies, conducting ongoing evaluations of progress towards objectives and goals.  The field advisor provides early notification to the Narcotics Control Officer to potential problems areas, and conducts on-site inspections to ensure sound professional management principles and practices are applied to prevent waste, fraud or abuse in the use of USG resources.  In addition, the EOA participates in the end-use monitoring process that tracks donated commodities to ensure appropriate use.

The Clinical Center Complex of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is located in Bethesda, Maryland.  The Clinical Center is the hospital of the NIH consisting of 234 inpatient beds, 81 day hospital stations, outpatient clinics, diagnostic and treatment areas, and public waiting areas.  Adjacent to the hospital facilities are research laboratories.  The complex consists of the Warren G. Magnuson Clinical Center (Magnuson Center) that covers 661,600 sq. ft. and the Mark O. Hatfield Clinical Research Center (Hatfield Center) that covers 698,263 sq. ft.  The Magnuson Center is fifty years old and had a substantial addition completed in 1981 which is called the Ambulatory Care Research Facility (ACRF).  The ACRF is a fourteen-floor structure which houses clinics and research laboratories on twelve floors.  The first and second levels of the ACRF houses clinical services including diagnostic radiology, nuclear medicine and PET, surgery, transfusion medicine and laboratory medicine.   

The Hatfield Center opened in 2005 and houses the inpatient units, day hospitals, additional clinics, admissions, pharmacy, social work, rehabilitation medicine departments, staff use areas, support areas and research laboratories.  The Hatfield Center is a seven-story structure with a central large open atrium at the core of the building that connects four separate sectors that house occupants.  Patients are housed on levels 1, 3, 5 and 7 on the southeast, southwest, northeast and northwest sectors of the facility.  Levels 2, 4, and 6 are interstitial mechanical space except for small clusters of offices on the east and west elevator lobbies and atrium portions of the facility.

<RESPDATE>020207
<ARCHDATE>04032007
<CONTACT>Pat Hagginbothom, 757-878-4818
<DESC>DESC:  This is a synopsis for a noncommercial transparent armor system.  Aviation Applied Technology Directorate (AATD) has a requirement to develop and evaluate transparent armor technology for application to military aircraft.  The objective of the  Development of Transparent Armor Systems project is to develop affordable high performance lightweight transparent armor materials, applicable to multiple military aircraft and ground weapons systems.  Military combat systems have long had a need for tran sparencies that have the capability to protect occupants from ballistic projectiles (both small arms fire and high velocity fragments from larger explosive weapons).  To date, the basic production technology for armored transparencies has been through the use of multiple layers of bullet-proof glass in a bonded sandwich configuration.  Transparencies constructed in this way are extremely heavy, particularly for aviation applications, are only single-shot capable due to fracture and disbonding obscuring visibility, and tend to environmentally degrade and disbond over time, rendering them opaque.  Lightweight transparent technologies that have emerged through the years, such as aluminum oxynitride (AlON), synthetic spinel, synthetic sapphire, and ceramic g lasses, tend to be lighter and tougher than glass approaches but are prohibitively expensive due primarily to the high costs of polishing the raw materials to a transparent state.  The period of performance for this development and test is twenty-four (24)  months.  AATD intends to award a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract to Simula Aerospace & Defense Group, Inc.  Simulas unique qualifications for fulfilling the contract requirements are based on their access to a viable solution.  This acquisition will be proc ured in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1) and FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  As a result of the sole source nature of this requirement a best value solicitation will not be  utilized, therefore, evaluation factors are not applicable.  This acquisition will use Alpha Contracting procedures that are appropriate for sole source requirements. The government intends to award a Cost Plus-Fixed Fee contract for twenty-four months. Simula Aerospace & Defense Group, Inc located in Phoenix, AZ is the only known source that manufactures the viable solution to perform the required effort.    This acqui sition is in response to a tasking to support the Joint Aircraft Survivability Program Office (JASPO) through the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR).  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) applicable to this effort is 336413.  Alpha con tract negotiators, appropriate for sole source requirements will be limited to Simula.  The contract requirements will be developed jointly between the government and Simula, consistent with alpha procedures and applicable cost principles, clauses and prov isions IAW FAR.  No options are included. A solicitation document is not available.  While the Government does not anticipate competition, any interested/qualified source that believes they can provide the required components must submit a proposal no later than 2:00 PM, Eastern Daylight Time, 2 F eb 2007.  Submit inquiries/proposals regarding this procurement to:  Aviation Applied Technology Directorate, ATTN:  Mrs. Pat Hagginbothom (AMSRD-AMR-AA-C), 401 Lee Blvd, Fort Eustis, Virginia 23604-5577.  Point of Contact is:  Pat Hagginbothom, Contract S pecialist, at (757) 878-4818 phagginbothom@aatd.eustis.army.mil. See Notes 8, 22 and 26.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions regarding solicitation #: FDA-SOL-07-00145 1.Is this a new requirement or is there an incumbent contractor? ANSWER: This is a new requirement 2.Is there a Wage Determination Classification or GS equivalent salary level in mind for this position? ANSWER: This position requires a combination of computer database skills and responsibilities well above an administrative assistant or clerical. The contractor must organize data and present it in a graphical presentation to professionals. The contractor must be able to read drug labels and promotional pieces and spot technical deficiencies that should be brought to the attention of staff veterinarians or senior Consumer Safety Officers. The contractor must also be able to accurately enter, organize and present adverse drug events data. At the same time, the contractor must be able to work with an Oracle database that contains information pertaining to Drug Experience Reports. Drug Experience Reports consist of labeling information, adverse drug events and manufacturing information. The contractor must be able to gather information and present it at a moments notice for evaluation by professional staff (Veterinary Medical Officer). The contract position is between a clerical assistant and a professional, such as an experienced Consumer Safety Officer (CSO) or Program Analyst GS 9. 3.Is there an expectation for travel associated with the duties of this position? ANSWER: There is no travel. 4.Is more than 1 FTE required for this position? ANSWER: Only 1 FTE is required. 5.Could you tell me if these services are currently being provided by a contractor? If so, could you provide the incumbent name as well as the contract number? ANSWER: There is no contractor currently providing these services. 6.Person or entity currently performing the contract. ANSWER: There is no one currently performing under a specific contract. 7.Former award/contract information (inclusive award/solicitation number and amount). ANSWER: None 8.Would you agree that the position is for a general clerk? ANSWER: This position is not for a general clerk. The title of the contract is also inaccurate. It is not administrative support per se. It is between a administrative assistant and a professional (Veterinary Medical Officer) and would more closely resemble a Consumer Safety Officer or a Program Analyst. It requires skills and abilities well beyond a general clerk. This person must be able to function somewhat independently but with some direction from the Project Officer. ** The closing date is not affected by this amendment, it remains as December 25, 2006. ****

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment to RFP H9222207R0055 is to post the Questions/Answers for the UHF High Gain SATCOM Antennas (RFP H9222207R0055) solicitation. Questions and Government Responses are as follows:  1. Cable requirements: a. In the SOW at paragraph 2.1, the 150 ft. cable replaces the two (2) 12.5 ft. cables normally supplied with Trivec-Avant Corporation (TAC) AV-2011.  This will increase the weight of the system by 16 lbs to 56 lbs.  If the 150 ft. cable in the AV-2011 system replaces the two (2) 12.5 ft. cables, will the part number need to be differentiated from the AV-2011? b. In the SOW at paragraph 2.2, the 150 ft. cable replaces the two (2) 12.5 ft. cables normally supplied with TAC AV-2012.  This will increase the weight of the system by 15 lbs to 36 lbs.  If the 150 ft. cable in the AV-2012 system replaces the two (2) 12.5 ft. cables, will the part number need to be differentiated from the AV-2012?  c.	In the SOW at paragraph 2.3, the two (2) cables (8 ft and 12 ft) replace the 6 ft. cable normally supplied with TAC AV-2040-2.  This will increase the weight of the system by 0.5 lbs to 7 lbs.  If the two (2) cables, 8 ft and 12 ft, in the AV-2012 system replace the two (2) 12.5 ft. cables, will the part number need to be differentiated from the AV-2040-2? d. In the SOW at paragraph 2.4, the two (2) cables (8 ft and 12 ft) replace the 6 ft. cable normally supplied with TAC AV-2055-3.  This will increase the weight of the system by 0.5 lbs to 3.5 lbs.  If the two (2) cables, 8 ft and 12 ft, in the AV-2055-3 system replace the two (2) 12.5ft cables, will the part number need to be differentiated from the AV2055-3?  Government Response:  The solicitation will be amended to identify five (5) additional and separate CLINs for the Coaxial RF cables:  3 ft,  8 ft, 12 ft, 25 ft, and 150 ft.  The Statement of Work will identify the commercial requirements for the systems without the additional cable replacements.  2.

Can you confirm the size of the focal plane array you list in your solicitation? The industry standard for mid format arrays is often 640x480 pixels, so I am curious as to the reason you ask for a 640x512 sized array. Answer 1 .  Because a 640x480 pixel array is the industry standard for this range camera, we would accept a 640x480 array as long as all other requirements are also met. Question 2.  If we can satisfy the 10K + thermal human detection range, will you accept a smaller array size? Answer 2.  Nothing smaller than a 640x480 is acceptable. Question 3.  On the two camera mount specification, would you like the thermal and visual camera to be mounted & Housed individually, Or in a single enclosure with additional space on the pan tilt head for an additional sensor? Answer 3.  Individual, separate mounted cameras is preferred.  However, a single enclosure or combined mounting configuration will be considered. Question 4.  On the hard wired or wireless specification, Would you like hard wired and wireless? What range for wireless? Range from command and control center to actual camera. Answer 4.  Hard wired  is required .   Wireless capability of the system is also requested.   A minimum wireless transmission range of three (3) miles is requested. Question 5.  On the monitor spec, What size would you like? Answer 5.  10"-12". Question 6.  Does this system require any recording Capability? Answer 6.  No.

<DESC>Proposals can be hand carried, mailed, courier (i.e. FEDEX), e-mail (pdf only). Faxes will not be accepted.  Note the address for submission of proposals at 525 St. Charles St. in New Orleans LA is the Federal Reserve Bank Building (FRB). If you hand  carry, you will have to enter the building on Carondelet Street.  Be prepared to be screened by FRB security.  1 copy is sufficient. The following is the second and final list of questions and answers regarding this solicitation: Question 1 - Is there a facility badge requirement for the workers on this contract? Badges will be processed by the LA-RFO Security Office.  Answer -Issuance of badges will be coordinated upon contract award. Question 2 - Are there any specific payroll requirements for workers on this contract since they are temporary (workers' comp, health insurance).  Answer - The Service Contract Act (SCA)Wage Determination as identified in the solicitation is a requirement of this contract. Question 3 - What if  all the debris/demo work is not completed by August 2007?  Could this contract be extended so we complete the QA work? Answer - If the work extends beyond August 2007 a new contract will be solicited.  Question 4 - Are there any requirements to have a DCAA approved accounting system since there are cost reimbursements involved along with tracking and billing of time? Answer - No Question 5 - Do 33% of workers used in this contract (QARs, etc) have to reside in a Hubzone in order for the Prime Contractor to maintain their Hubzone status, or since they are contract labor, this is not required? Answer  Please see FAR 52.219-3 Question 6 - Will there be an extension given to the proposal submission deadline? Answer - No Question 7 - Regarding question 9; Please provide additional details for GFE.  Specifically, what does the COE intend to provide to the contractor as GFE, when will it be available? What COE support will be provided for such equipment?  Will such GFE be tu rned in at end of contract?  Answer - Job specific equipment (i.e. GPS units, tape measure, office supplies) will be provided by the Government as needs dictate. All equipment issued will be returned as directed by the Resident Engineer. Question 8 - Please clarify apparent disconnect between prescribed hours per day (10) and days per week (6) and the proposed 132,000hrs, 5,280hrs and 2,640hrs O/T for QARs, CTLs and CQAS respectively.  Based on 120,000 hours straight time and 100 QARs task  will last 30 weeks.  With six days a week at 10 hours per day, there will only be 20 hours per week of O/T for a total of 60,000 ours over the entire task.  Answer  Theses hours are estimates only. The standard work week in the statement of work is for planning purposes. The contractor can be expected that some QAs will work more than the standard 60 hours in a week, and some less. Question 9 - Will contractor charge one day of equipment and job related travel for each day a person works (logs any time)?  Answer - Yes Question 10 - Please clarify apparent disconnect between the 24,000, 960 and 480 days of Equipment and job related travel for the QARs, CTLs and CQAS respectively and the task duration.  With a 30 week task duration the max number of QAR, CTL and CQAS da ys is 21,000, 840 and 420 respectively. Answer  These are for the full 100 QARs, 4 CTLs, and 2 CQASs for a total of 240 days (32 weeks) if so ordered. The estimated hours equate to 30 weeks of time to account for schedule flux. Question 11 - Section 2.1 provides equivalent government pay grade levels for the three specified labor positions. Are these pay grade levels to be used as a guideline for determining pay rates or are they the minimum pay rates for the position? Answer  These pay grades are for comparative purposes only. The contractor will be required to comply with the SCA Wage Determination identified in the solicitation.  Question 12 - Section 5.2 states that the standa rd work schedule is for 10 hours per day, 6 days per week. This would equate to 40 hours regular time per week and 20 hours overtime. However, the Pricing Schedule indicates that the work will be in excess of 80 hours, specifically 40 hrs of regular time a nd 44 hrs of overtime per week. What is the reason for the discrepancy between Section 5.2 and the Pricing Schedule? Answer  These are estimates only and will be used for evaluation purposes.  The contractor should be anticipate some QAs will work in excess of the 60 hour standard schedule and some less.  Question 13 - Amendment 1 of the subject solicitation specifies that the standard work schedule will be 10 hours per day, 6 days per week. However, the estimated quantities in the pricing schedule equate to 12 hours per day, 7 days per week. Is this correc t? Is the difference to allow for a surge in the workload while remaining under the contract ceiling? Answer  Yes to both questions
