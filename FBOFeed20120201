<DESC>This announcement serves as notice the Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC), Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM) Systems Directorate at Los Angeles AFB, CA anticipates issuance of a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) solicitation for a study, to include concept development and component level demonstration, on the feasibility and affordability of using existing and/or narrowly modified commercial protected satellite communication (SATCOM) systems to support future protected MILSATCOM needs. SMC will consider alternative protected MILSATCOM design concepts that modify the placement of processing functions associated with a robust, Lower Probability of Intercept/Low Probability of Detection (LPI/LPD) and anti-jam frequency-hopped spread-spectrum system (FHSS) between the space, terminal and/or ground segments relative to traditional highly protected MILSATCOM system designs. SMC is soliciting proposals to architect, prototype, and demonstrate specific elements of such protected MILSATCOM design concepts focused on improved life-cycle affordability. SMC has identified elements of the space, ground, and terminal segments for risk reduction activities. This acquisition will be conducted on a Full and Open Competitive basis in accordance with the procurement procedures outlined in FAR 35.016, "Broad Agency Announcement." This effort involves the concept development and demonstration of tasks over three phases: Phase I: Design Concept Development and Demonstration; Phase II: Design Concept Demonstration and Validation, and Phase III: Interoperability Demonstration. Phases II and III will be options under any resulting contract. The anticipated period of performance for all three phases, if exercised, is 24 months. Multiple awards are possible. The Government may award some, all, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement subject to the availability of funds.
<p>All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by SMC. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 517410. The small business size standard is $15 Million. Small and small disadvantaged businesses are encouraged to participate. Interested sources must request a copy of the BAA solicitation in writing from both points of contact listed below. Verbal requests for a copy of the BAA solicitation will not be accepted.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for the Contractor to repair, restore and modify the Government components of the FAA's Product Services Division (AML-4000), for the AXSYS Mobile Surveillance System IR Camera and the Legacy Remote Video Surveillance System POD Camera.  AXSYS Technologies IR Systems, Inc. is the authorized source of repair/overhaul and owner of internal design of these surveillance systems.  The FAA contemplates awarding a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Requirements contract with one base and four one-year option periods to fulfill this requirement.
The FAA intends to solicit and negotiate only with AXSYS Technologies IR Systems, Inc. of Nashua, NH; in accordance with AMS Policy 3.2.2.4.
The determination to solicit and negotiate with only one firm is necessitated and supported by the fact that AXSYS Technologies owns the proprietary data rights associated with the equipment to be repaired under the contemplated contract. The design and proprietary data rights exclusively available to AXSYS, includes all manufacturing data required for the repair of the Surveillance equipment mentioned above.  
This announcement is for information purposes only, not a request for proposals.

<DESC>THIS PROJECT WILL BE FUNDED BY THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009. This pre-solicitation notice is hereby issued in accordance with the requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 5.704.
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 emphasizes the need for the United States to move toward electronic health records. The legislation requires the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), in part, to establish a Health Information Technology Testing Infrastructure (HITTI) that supports effective industry consensus standards development processes and provides the United States healthcare information technology (HIT) industry and federal activities with robust conformance and interoperability testing capabilities.</p>
<p>NIST is responsible for leading the development of the core HITTI that will provide a scalable, multi-partner, automated, remote capability for current and future testing needs. Initial emphasis will be on testing the standards addressing high national healthcare priorities (e.g., as identified and/or defined in concept of Electronic Health Record (EHR) technology "meaningful use"). NIST will work with standards and specification development organizations and other stakeholders to ensure appropriate feedback mechanisms exist for updating the standards.</p>
<p>The objective of the HITTI Project is to harmonize the efforts of healthcare standards test development and delivery to meet the demands for conformance and interoperability within the healthcare domain. This will be accomplished by working in collaboration with health IT stakeholders such as vendors, implementers, standards organizations, and certification bodies to establish a testing infrastructure that will:<br />-Provide a variety of conformance and interoperability testing services;<br />-Support a broad range of test environments;<br />-Support numerous health data exchange standards;<br />-Provide a component-based user interface;<br />-Enable user customization;<br />-Support changing user requirements; and<br />-Provide a feedback loop to enhance the health standards.</p>
<p>The following items are not within scope and shall not be considered part of the HITTI:<br />-Developing standards; <br />-Performing certifications;<br />-Conducting operational testing.<br /><br />The NAICS code for this requirement is 541511 with a small business size standard of $25.0 million. Contracting by Negotiation shall be utilized under the authority of FAR Part 15. This requirement is 100% set-aside for small business. A time and materials contract is anticipated.</p>
<p>The competitive Request for Proposal (RFP), amendments, and all questions and answers related to this procurement shall be made available via the Internet at HTTP://WWW.FEDBIZOPPS.GOV under RFP number SB1341-11-RP-0039.</p>
<p>Potential offerors shall be responsible for obtaining this solicitation and related Amendments, if any, from www.fbo.gov after the solicitation has been posted. It is, and will continue to be, the responsibility of each potential Offeror to monitor www.fbo.gov for any amendments or other information related to the solicitation. The Government will not maintain a mailing list.</p>
<p>Any communication regarding this requirement must be made in writing and forwarded via email to carol.wood@nist.gov, and shall identify the solicitation number, company name, company address, as well as point of contact email address and phone number.</p>
<p>Offerors shall be actively registered in the Central Contractor Registration website at www.ccr.gov, in order to be eligible to receive a contract under this solicitation.</p>
<p>NIST anticipates posting the solicitation approximately 15<br />days after the date of publication of this notice.</p>

The New Cumberland Special Response Team (SRT) training will consist of at least two training sessions each year and coordinate security contingency drills and exercises with Department of Navy (DoN) personnel as well as provide the base police force with vital information and practice in the area of:  immediate response actions while awaiting for the arrival of the Federal SRT force, determine best practices for coordinating with the Federal SRT once it arrives, and decide the best practices for combined base police and SRT responses to the various types of emergency scenarios, including active Shooter, terrorist attack, hostage, and other emergency situations.

The Government intends to award as a Firm Fixed Price contract that will consist of a 12-month base year and four (4) option year periods.

Synopsis or Description

THIS PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE IS BEING ADVERTISED AS A SMALL BUSINESS COMPETITIVE, DESIGN-BID-BUILD SOLICITATION.

THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO AWARD A FIRM-FIXED PRICE CONTRACT UNDER SOLICITATION/REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL N44255-12-R-3001, P-188 REPLACE FUEL PIPELINE AT NAVAL AIR STATION WHIDBEY ISLAND, WA.
 The NAICS Code for the proposed acquisition is 237120. The size standard is $33,500,000.00. The Federal Supply Code is Z299.

Competition for this procurement is limited to eligible Small Business.

DESCRIPTION OF WORK:  This is a design-bid-build project to construct a new 12 diameter steel underground pipeline covering 4.6 miles between fuel pier on Seaplane Base and Consolidated Fuel Facility tanks at Ault Field Naval Air Station. Following completion of the new pipeline two existing 60 year old pipelines (8 and 4 diameter) will be decommissioned per WA Department of Ecology requirements. The new pipeline also involves construction of a gravel patrol road (~1 mile) for pipeline observation over a portion of the route where the pipe is not under or near existing roadways.
 The construction requires trenchless construction methods at 3 major roadway crossings. The work also includes a new pipeline leak detection system and a fiber optic communication system along the 4.6 mile route. The existing pipeline, built in 1954, continues to corrode, shedding rust particles into the fuel pipeline and posing an environmental risk of rupturing. Because the pipeline is varying sizes it cant be internally inspected along the entire length. Previous external pipeline inspections identified areas of corrosion across the pipe length. As a result, operating pipe pressure has been limited increasing the frequency and duration of fuel barge deliveries. Lack of cathodic protection creates the potential for catastrophic environmental contamination.
 Moreover, the pipeline is too small to support the fuel transfer rates from the fuel pier to the NAS storage tanks to meet operational requirements and efficient fuel delivery timeframes.

AWARD INFORMATION: The Government will award one Firm-Fixed Price contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible, responsive proposer whose proposal conforms to the solicitation considered to be the best value to the Government, price and technical factors considered.  Proposers will be evaluated on:  Factor 1:  Relevant Experience; Factor 2:  Past Performance; Factor 3: Safety; Factor 4: Management Approach and Price.  The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all proposers; use of tradeoff processes when it may be in the best interest of the Government; to consider award to other than the lowest priced proposers or other than the highest technically rated proposer; and to award to the proposer submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous (best value) to the Government.
  Proposers should be advised THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO EVALUATE PROPOSALS AND AWARD WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED.  Therefore, proposals should be submitted initially on the most favorable terms.  

The solicitation will be available for viewing and downloading at https://www.neco.navy.mil, upon issuance.  Prospective Offerors must and should immediately register themselves on the web site.  Amendments will be posted on the web site.  This will normally be the only method of amendment distribution; therefore, it is the OFFERORS RESPONSIBILITY TO CHECK THE WEB SITE PERIODICALLY FOR ANY AMENDMENTS TO THE SOLICITATION.  Offerors must also be registered in the Contractors Central Registration (CCR) in order to participate in this procurement at https://www.bpn.gov/ccr/.
  
All inquiries should be submitted to Mr.
 Gabe D. Perez (360) 396-1861 or via email gabe.d.perez@navy.mil.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Network Contracting Office (NCO) 5, is soliciting proposals under Solicitation No. VA245-12-R-0011 for the following:
BACKGROUND
The Department of Veterans Affairs, National Office of Clinical Consultation and Compliance (OCCC) consists of a National office, seven (7) Regional offices in the continental United States and 85 employees.  The OCCC serves to educate and support 156 healthcare facilities and their associated clinics and satellite campuses on the implementation of a customized VHA Quality Management System (QMS) consistent to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9001:2008 ("ISO 9001") requirements.  
The VHA created a T-21 Scope Action Plan Initiative to implement an ISO 9001 consistent QMS within Sterile Processing Department/Reusable Medical Equipment (SPD/RME) operations throughout VHA.  Thus, the ISO 9001 Implementation will start with the SPD/RME operations and continue on to additional priority areas.  The OCCC requires assistance with the development, design, training, and realization of this Implementation program for the customized ISO 9001 QMS within VHA.  The ISO 9001 QMS implementation will be accomplished through multiple Implementation Workshops, consultative visits, assessments, special training, the use of common communication platforms, and other types of training as need dictates.  The expertise required under this contract is specific to design, training, and implementation of a customized ISO 9001 QMS in large (150 beds or over) integrated healthcare organizations/hospital facilities who provide both inpatient and outpatient services. The geographic coverage of the implementation program and consultative visits includes national, regional, and local training and implementation anywhere within the continental United States.  If the contractor is a certification body, said contractor will be precluded from providing future certification auditing to the VA for the purpose of ISO 9001:2008 certification.  This time of preclusion begins at the end of this contract period and lasts for a period of three (3) years.  Reference: ISO 17021.  

SCOPE
The Implementation Rollout of the VHA/SPD specific, ISO 9001 consistent QMS involves the following elements:
"	Phase I (Pilot): Rolled out within seven (7) previously selected VHA facilities,  to include:
o	Assignment and coaching to pre-work, if required
o	Implementation (OCCC Consultants' training will occur within the Pilots)
o	Follow on support
"	Phase II (National rollout): Rolled out to the remaining VHA facilities, to include:
o	Assignment and coaching to pre-work, if required
o	Implementation
o	Follow on support
"	At least three (4) Implementation Workshops for each Phase (one session for each module of the designed QMS/designed implementation plan or as otherwise designed.)  Combined, the modules will cover implementation of the entire ISO 9001 Standard, to include a quality manual and the six (6) required procedures.
o	Implementation Workshops are generally face-to-face programs (but may be run virtually) that brings teams from the front line together with their OCCC Consultants and the contracted vendor (faculty) to learn how to implement the designed QMS within SPD/RME operations. 
o	Phase I (Pilot) will occur at each Pilot facility location.
"	Completion of pre-work by the implementation teams, including identifying team members, gathering and analyzing relevant data and other actions related to the implementation work, as required or necessary.
"	An Action Period occurs between each Implementation Workshop.  During the Action Periods, the teams implement each module of the designed QMS, test the changes, monitor the impact of their changes, etc.  
"	Conference calls: During these Action Periods, contracted faculty conduct conferences calls with OCCC Consultants and leaders, during which time the teams report on their progress and obtain guidance on challenges or barriers they are experiencing.

<DESC>This Sources Sought Synopsis is being issued to assist the Air Force Electronic Systems Center (ESC) Tactical Data Links Branch (HNAB) in determining industry's interest and capability in satisfying the requirements to improve upon the Government's existing Common Data Link (CDL) Waveform testing capability. Any information submitted by respondents to this sources sought is strictly voluntary.
<p>The Government is seeking to procure portable test stations that are fully capable of reporting on a CDL terminal's compliance with CDL waveform specifications beyond those defined in Standard CDL (STD-CDL) waveforms.<br /><br />CDL waveforms are specifically being developed for supporting higher capacity data links and are Net-Centric Internet Protocol (IP) capable. Government test organizations require portable and modular test equipment for determining if CDL Terminals containing one or more of a family of CDL waveforms and acting as either Unit Under Test (UUT) or in a System Under Test (SUT) configuration are compliant with CDL waveform specifications. The M-CWCT will be used to ensure CDL systems are capable of providing seamless real-time connectivity/interoperability between multiple Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) collection platforms.</p>
<p>Department of Defense (DoD) Instruction Number 4630.09, dated 3 November 2008 with the Subject: Wireless Communications Waveform Development and Management contains a description of the CDL waveforms of interest as well as key CDL waveform parameters that will be considered for verification in a compliance test scenarios performed by a M-CWCT.</p>

<DESC>This announcement is a Sources Sought Synopsis and is NOT a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government. The Government does NOT intend to contract on the basis of this request or otherwise pay for any information solicited herein. <br />This synopsis is to notify interested contractors that the Government intends to procure 28 each "F-15 Heat Stack Assemblies" as part of a follow-on contract for continued development of the F-15. The F-15 Heat Stack Assemblies are considered highly specialized because the geometry, materials and processing requirements have been optimized as part of the of the brake system. Brake systems are designed to let the heat out a certain way so that things cool quickly without causing some of the surrounding components (brake housing, wheels, etc.) to get too hot which would result in a failure. If the wrong materials, processes, and geometry are used for the heats shield it could be either ineffective, unreliable or both. That is why it needs to be qualified with the rest of the system. These parameters are limited to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) with the designs, data, and drawings created at Honeywell International Inc's own expense. Since the data required manufacturing the F-15 Heat Stack Assemblies are limited to Honeywell International Inc, interested vendors would have to be willing to invest the time, funding, and manpower required to reverse engineer the entire F-15 wheel and brake package at their own expense. Interested sources that have provided a similar item or this exact item for other government agencies should submit a Source Approval Request. (SAR) The Government does not have rights to the data for this requirement.<br />Contractors who believe that they can meet the aircraft design specifications to manufacture this part should contact the Government official listed in this synopsis.

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) for Commercial Service in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 12.1.  No proposals are requested by this announcement; all responses shall be solely in the form of information and materials.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. The Government is under no obligation to issue a solicitation or to award any contract on the basis of this RFI. Further, the Government will not accept unsolicited proposals.  All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be the sole responsibility of the contractor.  All submissions will be treated as business confidential materials, become Government property, and will not be returned. <br><br>Purpose - The 410th Contracting Support Brigade, Regional Contracting Center (Americas) (410th CSB-RCC)is requesting information from organizations and agencies on collecting data related to assessing the enduring effects of U.S. activities within the United States Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM) Area of Responsibility (AOR), consisting of South and Central America and the Caribbean. This  information will be used is to build a concept of execution for an assessment methodology, and possible Performance Work Statement (PWS), which incorporates best practices being utilized in the field. Examples of information requested are provided in the specifics below. <br><br>Background - The U.S. Government has historically sought to engage the countries in the USSOUTHCOM AOR through a multitude of activities ranging from those that build capacity for Peace Support operations to those that provide Humanitarian and Civic Assistance (HCA). Some of the outcomes of these activities produce concrete measurable results, while others produce less tangible results. All, taken as a whole series of events and activities, are meant to produce advancement of tactical and strategic civil-military objectives for the command. With the possibility of dwindling resources, and the real desire to employ resources effectively, USSOUTHCOM is looking for confirmation that these activities are achieving the long term and enduring positive impacts desired. <br><br>Specifics - The 410th CSB-RCC is planning to issue a future solicitation for data collection and assessment services in the near future. We are asking for information that offer solutions and capabilities available for planning purposes for the topic areas below. <br><br>Evaluation Experimental Design. USSOUTHCOM is looking for best practices and experiences in the design of the data collection efforts. Of particular value are methods to collect data (through surveys or other means) at least cost while still providing a high level of reliability and validity of results. The Evaluation Design may employ numerous methods. The source of potential bias (and means to mitigate) and the benefits/costs of each design method are critical for a study of this type. <br><br>	Concept of Execution. USSOUTHCOM is looking for responses from US Government organizations and other agencies, especially country teams and those working with our country teams in the SOUTHCOM AOR, who are executing data collection similar to this effort. For those with recent experience, the primary question is how to organize and execute this project. We also request examples of similar work which have been recently conducted. CONOPS should include an initial plan and measures needed to continue this effort over time.  <br><br>	Suggestions for the Test Activity. We are looking for a rational for the initial test activity.<br><br>	Use of Company Established in our Region.

<p>The National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing a low-energy, low-angle argon ion mill instrument which is required for final thinning of transmission electron microscopy specimens, and for removal of the amorphous damage layer on FIB-prepared TEM specimens. The diversity of sample types encountered from the wide range of projects at NIST's CNST NanoFab demands a technically advanced and flexible Ar ion mill. The mill must be capable of holding both 3-mm TEM specimen support grids and Omniprobe half grids. The energy must be variable, with a maximum energy of 6keV. Specimen cooling capabilities are required to reduce specimen heating. For cleanliness of the samples in the TEM, the Ar ion mill must have an oil-free vacuum system. The ion mill should have imaging capabilities for placement of the beam on the specimen and for monitoring the final thickness of the specimen. Since the ion mill will be installed in a multi-user facility, ease of use and quick sample exchange and cooling/warming times are necessary. After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for the Ar Ion Mill that can meet NIST's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.</p>
<p>NIST has a need for an ion mill that would meet the following requirements:</p>
<p>&bull; Argon gas source<br />&bull; Capable of holding both 3-mm TEM specimen support grids and Omniprobe half grids<br />&bull; Variable beam energy of 100eV or less, up to a maximum of 6 keV<br />&bull; Variable milling angles of +/- 10 degrees<br />&bull; Oil-free vacuum system<br />&bull; Fast specimen exchange times <br />&bull; Capable of liquid nitrogen cooling during milling<br />&bull; Redeposition of the milled material on the area of interest must be minimized<br />&bull; Imaging capability over the entire 3mm field of view, as well as magnified imaging to clearly monitor FIB prepared TEM specimens.</p>

<DESC>General:  The National Park Service, Department of Interior, intends to negotiate a sole source, Design-Build contract with the team of Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates, Inc. (WJE), Northbrook, Illinois, to acquire the  below listed services.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 238190, size standard is $14.0M.
Title of Project:  Shard Removal, Perry's Victory and International Peace Memorial, Put-in-Bay, Ohio 
Description:  The work of this proposed contract is to provide on-site inspection, investigation, analysis, stabilization, and temporary masonry repairs of the Monument.  
Perry's Victory and International Peace Memorial (PEVI) is located in Put-in-Bay Ohio on South Bass Island.  This park's main resource is a 352-foot monument in the form of a Doric column built of 78 courses of pink Milford, Massachusetts granite.  It is surmounted by a 23-foot tall bronze urn. Upper and Lower Plazas are of granite stones and a circular brick pattern at the base of the column with granite benches, urns, and planting boxes.  The column itself is essentially unreinforced masonry constructed on bedrock.
Since it was built, the materials on the monument have been subject to severe weather and freeze/thaw cycles as a result of water infiltration.  The column shows signs of stress such as exterior surface cracking and leaching discolorations coming out of joints.  In addition, granite shard pieces from the column have fallen off recently to the Upper Plaza below.  Some column distress occurs because of its height and the temperature fluctuations that happen on this unreinforced concrete structure. Previous joint treatments/repairs made during the 1980's may have made problems worse by not allowing moisture to naturally exit the column joints.  There are several types of granite distress present: cracking, spalls, and incipient spalls and delaminations at cracks. Delaminations, which typically occur adjacent to a crack within a granite block or a joint between blocks, indicate that a portion of the stone along the exposed surface of the block is separating from the main body of the granite block, usually along the plane of a crack that is visible on the exterior surface of the granite block. 
If not addressed, this condition allows the delaminating portion of the stone to loosen and become a falling hazard to the Upper Plaza below the column.  Allowing the structure to remain untreated will also increase risk of further material stress failures at the exterior surfaces of the column, thus creating an extreme hazard to both visitor and park staff safety at the Upper Plaza.  The park has installed a fence to prevent public and staff access onto the Upper Plaza because of this safety hazard.  Until this project has been completed and it can be determined that it is safe to re-open and allow public access to the Upper Plaza, the monument remains closed.   
Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates (WJE) is uniquely qualified to do the project because of their proven condition assessment expertise of investigating material failures on historic and monumental type structures.  They are very experienced with high angle masonry assessment inspections and developing treatment recommendations on buildings with problems associated with freeze/thaw distress caused by water infiltration.  WJE has expertise in the areas of tall structure scaffolding/rigging/constructability expertise, structural engineering with historic experience, historical stone mason experience, lime mortar and other joint sealant experience, historical stone conservator, material testing laboratories, waterproofing, historical architect, safety engineer, and cost estimating on similar, monumental-type historical structures.
WJE is uniquely qualified to do the project because they were previously contracted to perform an exterior condition assessment of the monument which later included interim measures to stabilize cracked fascia panels and to support two soffit corners from further displacement.  They also were involved in a recent column investigation at PEVI that must be continued in order to eliminate the hazards on the column which have forced the part to close the Upper Plaza.  The firm must return to the project site to complete the work previously performed on the project.  WJE's continuing involvement with this project is necessary to complete column repairs requiring a joint effort of engineering and masonry work.  Repairs to the cracked or spalled granite and mortar joints depend on their size, shape, and condition which will have to be inspected and located by an engineer in order to determine the type of repair to be made by the construction contractor.  Engineering location and evaluation of each column deficiency will have to be observed in the field before a mason can proceed with the repairs.
This acquisition is being conducted under the procedures of FAR 5.201 and 6.302.  The subsequent contract will be negotiated in accordance with FAR 36.606 and FAR Part 15.  The Government believes that the identified contractor is the "only one responsible source" as defined by FAR 6.302-1 for the required services. 
Firms believing they can provide the required services must provide supporting evidence in sufficient detail to demonstrate the respondent's ability to meet the stated requirements via submission of a brief statement of qualifications to include listings and references for at least five similar projects that have been completed in the past five years.  This notice is not a request for competitive quotes.  All responses received within 15 days of the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquires will only be accepted by email to Sharon_Miner@nps.gov.  Responses should include the statement of qualifications, listings and references of similar projects, and the firm's Dun and Bradstreet number.  In order to be considered, the firms must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration system.

<DESC>In accordance with FAR Subpart 15.205(a) and 6.302-1(a)(2), the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) intends to award a sole source contract under FAR 6.302-1 "only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." FEMA intends to award this contract to Cassidian Communications, Franklin, TN, 37067. The contract is for a web-based interface with enhancements to existing hardware/software that was designed and manufactured by Cassidian Communications. The existing software is proprietary and patented and only Cassidian possesses the corporate knowledge required to modify the existing system. Cassidian Communications will upgrade the existing FEMA ENS to meet the requirements of the Federal Continuity Directives and DHS Personnel Accountability System. <br />Market research has demonstrated that no other software or firm can provide web-based interface with enhancements to existing hardware/software supported by Cassidian Communications. As stated earlier, the ENS utilizes operating systems that are proprietary to Cassidian Communications. Installing and uploading another product from another contractor will void the warranty with Cassidian Communications and possibly create interoperability issues.<br />In addition, FEMA Directive 262-3 dated 11-3-11 designates the ENS system as the official FEMA solution for emergency notification. No other notification systems have been authorized for FEMA use.<br />See initial JOFOC (attachment) for Section 508 and security requirements. <br />The total value of this requirement is anticipated to be approximately $1.5 million and the expected period of performance is to be one (1) base year and four (4) option years for a total of five (5) years from date of award.<br />FEMA is aware of no other firm, other than Cassidian Communications that can provide the type of services and software maintenance described here and in the JOFOC. However, any firm that believes it is capable of providing equivalent services that meet the specifications stated and is an ENS that is authorized by FEMA shall e-mail a Statement of Specifications and associated product literature to Christine.Todd@dhs.gov no later than 2:00 PM EST on February 16, 2012. <br />

<CONTACT>Maria Gonzalez, Contracting Officer, Phone (541) 383-5547, Fax (541) 383-5544, Email mgonzalez@fs.fed.us
<DESC>The Deschutes National Forest is seeking testing of seed for R6 Bend Seed Extractory. Seed purity, viability &amp; moisture content examinations conducted for R6 Seed Extractory must be completed by AOSA (Association of Seed Analysts) certified analyst in an accredited laboratory. Examinations are completed at the time of initial seed processing and then re-tested every 3-5 years, depending on the species; as required by the WCF Seed bank regulations (FSM 2474.23) and per FSM 2470.03,3 (develop procedures &amp; arrangements with accredited seed testing laboratories to test seed for purity viability and moisture content and to supply standard laboratory reports of tests results. Currently the only site listed in the AOSA Oregon State list is Oregon State University (ref. http://www.aosaseed.com/ ). Historically, the OSU Seed Laboratory has been conducting these exams; based on FSH 2409.26f SEED HANDBOOK; 42.1-6 which required OSU to be the examiner. The OSU Seed Laboratory have test exam results on file as far back as the initial exam for each seed lot; so these records are available to the R6 Bend Seed Extractory should something happen to our existing documents on-site. Because of the long-standing historical use of the OSU Seed Laboratory for these exams, OSU has extensive experience in performing tree seed germination exams and has equipment to do large volumes of seed lots in a short time span. They also perform both the no-chill and multiple-week pre-chill germination exams. In addition, since OSU is within the state of Oregon, it allows the R6 Seed Extractory personnel to visit and observe their services at any time. To keep records consistent with previous seed lots exams following the viability of the seed in long-term storage, the Seed Handbook requirements of using OSU Seed Laboratory and the fact they are the only AOSA accredited seed laboratory in the state of Oregon, only OSU State University can perform these tests. Therefore the Government intends to award a contract for this requirement to <strong>OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY, KERR ADMINISTRATION B306, CORVALLIS OREGON 977331 </strong>This is not a request for competitive quotes. However, all interested parties who believe they may meet these requirements may submit in writing, within 5 calendar days of this notification, complete information describing the ability to meet these requirements. Information will be used solely for purposes of whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Companies that can provide an equal product must submit their technical capabilities to include technical specifications of their product, past performance information, price and delivery time. All responses to this announcement must be directed to Maria Gonzalez mgonzalez@fs.fed.us not later than 12 noon, Pacific Standard Time, February 6, 2012. TELEPHONIC QUESTIONS OR REQUESTS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.

<DESC>Under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation, Part 6, Subparts 6.302-1, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) intends to contract with Marine Computation Services, Inc. (MCS) on a sole source basis. This acquisition is being conducted using Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures.
USDOT PHMSA is the Federal agency charged with the safe, reliable, and environmentally sound operation of the nation?s pipeline offshore and onshore transportation system.  The current version of API RP 2RD, the standard for dynamic risers for floating facilities, was last updated in 1998 and contains little information on application of best practices.  There are volunteers from industry currently working to revise the standard but, due to heavy workloads, the deadline set by the American Petroleum Institute (API) and the International Standards Organization (ISO) may not be met.  In the fall of 2007, MCS presented a proposal for launching a Joint Industry Project (JIP) to expedite the update of the ISO/API standard by providing project administration, drafting, technical, and project management support to the existing joint ISO/API Task Group.  The JIP is to be funded by various organizations that each contribute a $40,000 sponsorship/membership fee.  An objective of PHMSA's safety program is to ensure that industry has access to the best design, construction and maintenance practices.  The objective of the fee for service purchase is to participate in and support the JIP in their efforts to expedite the update of ISO 13628-12/API RP 2RD standard for Dynamic Risers for Floating Production Installations.

API RP 2RD is the most widely accepted steel riser code in the deepwater offshore industry.  The JIP has widespread industry and Federal Government support to ensure the revised version of the standard will be expedited quickly for submittal to ISO and API for approval.  MCS, along with one partner/subcontractor have collaborated to develop and lead the JIP.  MCS has a successful track record in the delivery of multiple industry JIPs over the past ten years, many of which have been focused on the development of industry codes of practice for riser and related subsea technologies.  

Any response to this notice must demonstrate that competition would be advantageous to the government. In doing so, interested sources must submit technical capabilities, pricing, and other information that demonstrates their ability to meet PHMSA's needs. Detailed capabilities must be submitted via e-mail not later than 5:00 PM EST on March 6, to Mr. Eric Hilton, eric.hilton@dot.gov, Contract Specialist, PHMSA Office of Contracts and Procurement.  

This synopsis is not to be considered a request for quotations or proposals. No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice, but offers will be used to determine if a comparable source is available and more advantageous to the government. If no affirmative written response is received within 15 days from the publication of this synopsis, a purchase order may be issued to Marine Computation Services, Inc.

<DESC>The US Army Corps of Engineers intends to award a sole source Firm Fixed Price Type contract to The Pacific Disaster Center (PDC) to provide applied information research, analysis and support for the development of more effective, policies, institutions, programs and information products for Disaster Management and Humanitarian Assistance.  The objective of the Nepal GIS Integration project is to improve disaster planning, preparedness, mitigation, response and recovery in Nepal.  This project will identify and collaboratively engage existing capabilities and resources enhancing the development and use of geospatial data, value-added information products and GIS-based tools addressing the potential impact of major regional earthquake events.  Geospatial information capacity is composed of systems of hardware, software, data, processes, people, organizations, and institutional arrangements for collecting, storing, analyzing, and disseminating geospatial information about areas of the Earth.  Its use before, during, and after an emergency can greatly enhance an end-users' ability to make accurate, efficient, and effective decisions.  Using a collaborative approach, the project will access and apply this capacity supporting the decision-making process related to regional disaster resilience and preparedness.<br><br>Tasks: The project is composed of three tasks described below. <br><br>3.1 	Task 1 - Assessment<br>An assessment of current geospatial resources and how they may be used to support emergency management will be conducted. An analysis of existing/emerging information requirements addressing disaster planning, preparedness and response will be completed and a gap assessment will be produced.<br><br>		3.1.1	Geospatial Resource Assessment<br>In collaboration with national, regional and international organizations this activity will identify existing relevant GIS capabilities and associated information repositories.  This task will inventory and assess agency requirements and current applications associated with geospatial information, currently available GIS resources (i.e., existing data/information resources, hardware, software, training programs, tools, etc.) and characterize these resources in terms of information quality, completeness, validity, relevance, accessibility and required skills to develop and apply these resources.<br><br>This task will be performed 50% by ICIMOD technical GIS specialists, 35% by PDC technical GIS specialists, and 15% USACE technical GIS specialists.  ICIMOD will lead the effort in-country, and PDC/USACE will play a supporting role with one or two trips to Nepal to assist in the data gathering process.  <br><br>		3.1.2	Requirements Analysis & Gap Assessment<br>This activity will identify gaps in the existing GIS resources, capabilities, access, and use based on the information gathered in the resource assessment.<br><br>				Deliverables:<br>				 	Resource Assessment & Gap Analysis Report<br><br>This task will be performed 60% by PDC technical GIS specialists, 25% by ICIMOD technical GIS specialists, and 15% by USACE technical GIS specialists.  After the data is gathered per Section 3.1.1, PDC will lead a reporting effort to identify geospatial resource and procedural gaps.  This effort will be supported by ICIMOD and USACE.<br><br>3.2	Task 2 - Pilot Capability Integration<br>Task 2 will use the assessment conducted in Task 1 to identify the most effective means of filling the gaps in GIS resources and information sharing.  This task will engage key organizations providing GIS capabilities for disaster preparedness in Nepal and will generate recommendations on a way forward in the enhancement of regional GIS capabilities.  These recommendations will be presented to the Government of Nepal. <br><br>		3.2.1	Integrated GIS Capability & Operational Concept<br>A pilot capability will be specified and limited integration of a GIS resource to address Katmandu earthquake risk and vulnerability will be completed. Capability integration will not be limited to only hardware, software, people, and databases, but will also address procedures and guidelines that standardize and facilitate information sharing between organizations. <br><br>This task will be performed 40% by PDC technical GIS specialists, 40% by ICIMOD technical GIS specialists, and 20% by USACE technical GIS specialists.  Both ICIMOD's Kathmandu Valley Earthquake GIS tool and PDC's Disaster Aware GIS tool will be evaluated as pilot capabilities.  One or the other, or a combination of the two, will be chosen to complete the requirements in Section 3.2.2.  USACE will support PDC and ICIMOD in defining the integrated GIS capability and operational concept. <br><br>		3.2.2	Pilot GIS Resource<br>A pilot capability, based on existing GIS and associated data/information repositories will be established.   This pilot resource will not create new and potentially redundant capabilities and will be used to support demonstrations discussed in Task 3.  <br><br>			Deliverables:<br>	                             Integrated GIS Capability Description and Operational Concept Report<br>			 	Pilot integrated GIS resource demonstration<br><br>This task will be performed 40% by PDC technical GIS specialists, 40% by ICIMOD GIS technical specialists, and 20% by USACE technical GIS specialists.  PDC and ICIMOD will lead this effort, with USACE playing a supporting role.  The integrated web-based GIS resource will be developed with the support and contribution of all PDT team members and stakeholders.<br><br>3.3	Task 3 -Pilot Activity<br>This task will build on the first two phases of this project to (1) identify relevant disaster preparedness and mitigation projects and (2) provide a pilot demonstration using the Pilot GIS Resource and existing PDC decision support systems (DSS) to explore the value of baseline and advanced data/information products supporting risk assessment, planning and disaster preparedness and response.  It will also demonstrate the efficacy of collaborative regional data sharing networks. The Government of Nepal will prioritize the list of projects generated from this effort, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Pacific Disaster Center will assist and support the Government of Nepal in completing a prioritized "pilot activity" emphasizing emergency preparedness.<br><br>			Deliverables:	<br>			 	Disaster Preparedness and Mitigation Project Recommendations<br>			 	Pilot Demonstration: Katmandu Valley Earthquake Event <br><br>This task will be performed equally by PDC, USACE, and ICIMOD technical GIS specialists.  The final results will assist the Government of Nepal and the U.S. Embassy with emergency management decision-making and possible GIS implementation procedures for enhanced response, recovery, and mitigation capabilities.<br><br>This is a special notice prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii)(A), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  However, any firm that believes it can meet this requirement may give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the date of publication of this announcement.  Supporting evidence must be in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the requirement.  Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government to compete the proposed procurement based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no responses are received, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will proceed with awarding a Firm Fixed Price type contract to PDC for Development of NEPAL GIS Integration Project.  These services will be provided to the Institute for Water Resources, Alexandria, VA.

<CONTACT>Corinne Nygren, Phone 6123363235, Email corinne.m.nygren@aphis.usda.gov
<DESC>(i) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This acquisition is being conducted in accordance with FAR 12 procedures for commercial items in conjunction with FAR part 15. (ii) This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. (iii) This combined synopsis/solicitation will result in a firm fixed price indefinite delivery indefinite quantity commercial services contract. Although the contract can be used by all four AMS food laboratories, the statement of work below is specifically written for the laboratory in Gastonia, NC. (iv) This combined synopsis/solicitation Request for Quote is being issued as a full and open competition. (v) This requirement is for the National Science Laboratory (NSL), United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) Science &amp; Technology Laboratory Division (S&amp;T-LD). The laboratory performs chemical, proximate, microbiological and bio-molecular testing of agricultural products for the agricultural community. These services include pesticide residue analysis, pathogen testing, testing for adulteration in domestic and imported products within a variety of matrices. In an effort to provide the highest possible quality and demonstrate recognition of its marketable testing services, the laboratory has a need to secure accreditation against the ISO/IEC 17025:2005 standard and AOAC International "Guidelines for Laboratories Performing Microbiological and Chemical Analyses of Food and Pharmaceuticals". Accreditation to the standards means global recognition for implementing a single, overarching management (quality) system and seamless audit system that conforms to the requirements of a recognized standard. Accreditation must be renewed periodically through review, surveillance or assessment in order for the laboratory to maintain recognition of that system. Recognition typically appears in the form of a certificate from the accreditation body. (vi) REQUIREMENT AND QUANTITIES: The offeror shall provide a price for line items 001 - 003 for each contract year, considering a sequence where assessments or surveillance occur alternatingly with annual accreditation fees within twelve month periods of a two year cycle. All overhead and ancillary costs associated with the requirement will be assumed by the Contractor, and should be factored into the quote. CLIN 001 - Accreditation Fee for each field. The offeror shall provide the annual accreditation fee for each field. CLIN 002 - Assessor Labor rates. The offeror must include the estimated labor hours in their quote based on the scope of the accreditation requested in this request for quote. CLIN 003 - Travel Costs. Travel to the laboratory may be required under this contract. Travel costs are a reimbursable line item and will be reimbursed based on actual costs. All travel will be within the continental United States. All travel costs associated with this requirement must be approved in writing by the agency personnel and the contracting officer, prior to commencing any travel under this project. Actual travel costs will be reimbursed at the rates provided in the Federal Travel or Joint Federal Travel Regulations. Travel must be in accordance with Federal Government Travel Regulations and all costs shall be subject to the restrictions of the Federal Travel Regulations. Please refer to the following websites for details on the travel regulations and the domestic travel per diem rates: http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/21222<br />http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/21287 CLIN 004 - AMS optional laboratory locations for all contract years. See part (vii). (vii) The USDA, APHIS reserves the right to add additional AMS-S&amp;T, Laboratory Division laboratory locations to this contract if the need arises. Although the current quantities and scope only reflect the laboratory in Gastonia, NC there is a possibility other laboratories will be added which could include locations in Georgia, Virginia and Florida. If these locations are added the dollar value of the contract could increase greatly. Any change to this contract to add these locations would be done via a bilateral modification exercising optional line item 004. (viii) The effective period of the contract is from date of award through twelve months with the options to extend the contract for four (4) additional years. The accreditation services for the base year must begin no later than March 1, 2012. The Gastonia, NC NSL's current accreditation expires 06/30/2012 therefore assessment for renewal of accreditation must occur prior to that date. A renewal assessment includes an &lsquo;on-site' and external examination of the laboratory. Occasionally there may be a need to update the laboratory's scope and/or certificate of accreditation during the two-year accreditation period (e.g. scope expansion, name change, contacts change, etc.). Whether updates or amendments require &lsquo;on-site' visits will depend upon the proposed changes to the laboratory's scope and/or certificate of accreditation. The date/time and length of visits will be mutually agreed upon by the laboratory and accreditation body based upon the laboratory's preparedness and ability to comply with the accreditation requirements and the relevant conditions of accreditation. (ix) STATEMENT OF WORK: The National Science Laboratory (NSL) in Gastonia, NC requires conformity assessment services for the purpose of preserving its accreditation status. Currently it is accredited to the ISO/IEC 17025:2005 standard and AOAC International, "Guidelines for Laboratories Performing Microbiological and Chemical Analyses of Food and Pharmaceuticals", with a scope that includes 15 analytical test methods, as follows: one (1) biomolecular test method, one (1) chemical test method, and thirteen (13) microbiological test methods. During the course of this renewal the laboratory would like to revise its scope with regard to a more &lsquo;flexible scope' option recognizing its use of standard test methods prepared by national, international, or professional standards writing bodies, and its in-house developed non-standard methods. NOTE: Information regarding the laboratories current scope of accreditation may be found by searching http://www.a2la.org for certificate numbers 2970.01 or 2970.02. The requirements for accreditation shall be established by the laboratory's application for accreditation to the standards and the accrediting body's conditions for accreditation. The accreditation body shall verify compliance with the requirements and conditions for accreditation, i.e. ISO/IEC 17025 standard and AOAC International, Guidelines for Laboratories Performing Microbiological and Chemical Analyses of Food and Pharmaceuticals. This will require the examination of documentation, records and personnel (including provisions for access to all calibration and testing areas, equipment, arrangements for witnessing accredited activities when requested and practicable) for the purpose of assessment, re-assessment, resolution of complaints, and fulfillment of customer requirements. Verification examination will likely occur both &lsquo;on-site' and externally to the laboratory's facilities. NOTE: Documentation verified includes, where applicable, those which provide insight into the level of independence of the laboratory from any other related activities undertaken by its organization. The laboratory shall also demonstrate to the accreditation body's satisfaction that it is not using its accreditation (e.g. testing certificate or report) in such a manner as to bring the accreditation body into dispute or make any statement relevant to its accreditation which is considered misleading or unauthorized. Lastly, it shall verify that the laboratory carries out, within a reasonable time, any adjustments to its management (quality) system in response to due notice of any deficiencies in complying with the requirements or conditions of accreditation; or changes to the criteria, requirements, or conditions for accreditation. The accreditation body selected must be a U.S. Signatory to a multilateral recognition arrangement (MRA) with The International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC). This is due to the necessity for recognition amongst the accrediting bodies. Additional information can be found on the following website: Link: http://www.standardsportal.org/usa_en/resources/USaccreditation_bodies.aspxUSAuthoritative Bodies<br />Several international agreements, arrangements, and schemes establish networks of internationally recognized, accredited conformity assessment bodies; however ILAC is the authority for national and international accreditation bodies' and evaluates for compliance with criteria specified in the international standard ISO/IEC 17011. For more information on ILAC please visit the following website: Link: http://www.ilac.org/<br />(x) The contract will allow for use of the government purchase card for payments under this contract.

<DESC>This is a solicitation prepared in accordance with FAR 12, and 15 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. PROPOSALS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND NO OTHER WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL BE ISSUED. In accordance with FAR 15.306 the Government will evaluate proposals in response to this solicitation without discussions. This solicitation document incorporates provisions and clauses which are in effect through the most current Federal Acquisition Circular. Applicable FAR clauses are incorporated by reference and may be viewed on the website https://www.acquisition.gov/far/index.html
<p>Supplies or Services - Prices/costs Vendors may submit one or both options but only one will be awarded</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />001 46,000lbs by March 1 2012<br />And an optional quantity of 7,000lbs by May 1 2012</p>
<p>Or</p>
<p>002 26,500lbs by March 1, 2012<br />And 26,500lbs by May 1 , 2012</p>
<p>Item Description:</p>
<p>53,000lbs of Agar Powdered USP, NF.</p>
<p>All Subject to Sample Approval.</p>
<p><br />Offeror shall submit a firm-fixed price offer for all costs necessary to furnish all equipment, labor, transportation, supplies, etc. needed to provide the Agar Powdered USP, NF according to the specifications. Price proposals should be of sufficient detail to determine their adequacy.</p>
<p>In the event one supplier is not able to supply the USDA, PPQ, PBWRF with the total amount of agar requested, in accordance with FAR 52.216-27, this request for proposals may result in multiple contract awards. The Government reserves the right to award to one offeror or make multiple award decisions based on the most advantageous offer to the Government. Offerors may proposal either one of option delivery schedules and quantities or both but only one will be awarded.</p>
<p>The PBWRF uses agar as a binding agent in the artificial insect diet prepared for rearing larvae of the pink bollworm. Contrary to most artificial insect diets containing agar, the pink bollworm diet is not left intact as poured, but is shredded into noodles approximately 5 mm wide and of varying thickness and length. Because of this special method of use, the agar acts more as a binding agent than it does a gelling agent as in other insect diets. As such, the requirements are more critical in terms of physical properties especially the strength of the gel (1.34% concentration) and the ability to retain moisture for a relatively long period of time. The agar supplied shall be the dried product of the water soluble extract of a species of Pterocladium, Gelidium or Gracilaria confervoides.</p>
<p>Excessive moisture loss from the diet results in two problems. If the loss comes from moisture-holding capability of the agar, the nutrients in the diet become too concentrated and if the loss comes from excessive syneresis, the resultant free moisture creates an unhealthy habitat for the larvae. In the case of the pink bollworm, the artificial diet not only provides the larvae with essential nutrients for their development, but also provides their living space. The agar shall not inhibit growth or reproduction of Pink Bollworm and must conform to the specifications listed above.</p>
<p>The product requested (Agar Powdered, USP, NF) shall meet the following minimum specifications:</p>
<p><br />1. The diet product of the water-soluble extract of Pterocladium, Gelidium or of Gracilaria <br />confervoides. All material supplied under this contract shall be of the same type of seaweed and from the same geographical source.</p>
<p>2. Not contain more than 6.5% total ash, on a dry weight basis. <br /><br />3. Not contain more than 0.5% acid--insoluble ash, on a dry weight basis. <br /><br />4. The particle size shall be: More than 75% (by weight) shall pass through a #60 U.S. Standard <br />Sieve.</p>
<p>5. Must not cause a 6% reduction for a period of seven continuous days in the yield of <br />insects, size of insects, or reproductive potential (oviposition rate), nor affect the life cycle <br />by an increase of 24 hours or more as determined by USDA bioassay after award of contract, <br />i.e. no bioassay of the sample is done because of the length of time required.</p>
<p>6. Agar must have a gel strength of 1500 g pressure or more as determined with FMC agar gel <br />testing machine, measurement is made as follows:</p>
<p>a. Nine grams of agar are weighed and placed in a small flask.<br />b. Six hundred fifty (650) milliliters of water is preheated to 140 degrees F in a stainless steel beaker. The beaker is then placed on a hot plate/stirrer which has been on high for 30 minutes.<br />c. The stirrer bar is activated and the agar is slowly added in and mixed.<br />d. When the mixture reaches boiling, a timer is set for five (5) minutes and the agar is kept at a rolling boil for the 5 minute period. At the end of the 5 minutes, it is removed from the heat and allowed to sit for one (1) minute. It is then poured into 50mm x 70mm crystallizing dishes. The first dish is partially filled in' order to remove as much foam from the cooked agar as possible. Three (3) additional dishes are then filled as full as possible.<br />e. Samples are allowed to gel three (3) *hours at room temperature.<br />f. A full dish of agar is set in the center of the platform of the electronic scale. The power is turned on and the scale tared to 0. The LED light is illuminated in order to maintain peak reading after the gel ruptures. The small plunger (10.9mm) and the blue spring (0 1500 grams tension) is used at high speed (18cm/minute). The down button is lowered which starts the synchronous motor which lowers the plunger at a constant rate. Once the plunger contacts the gel the increasing force is registered on the scale display. The highest measured force is when the gel ruptures, this reading will be maintained on the display until the LED light is turned off and the break force reading is recorded.<br />g. All three (3) dishes are tested and the average break force reading is used for the final result.</p>
<p>7. The gel point shall be within 32 degrees to 45 degrees C. and the melting point shall be <br />within 85 degrees to 89 degrees C.<br />8. Must readily dissolve in boiling water within 5 minutes.<br />9. Microbial content shall not exceed 10,000 micro-organisms per gram and must be free of <br />other contaminants.<br />9. Agar must be packaged in the same type of container with respect to volume and shape, irrespective of the quantity. The agar must be packaged in a separate heavy polyethylene inner bag positioned in a fiberboard/cardboard drums.

<DESC>NASA/KSC intends to purchase Bit Synchronizers, model MD2365A-08 quantity two eachfrom GDP Space Systems. The GDP Space Systems Model MD2365A-08 Multi-Channel PCI Bit Synchronizer Subsystem isbeing purchased to support telemetry operations in Launch Services Program facilities atCape Canaveral Air Force Station and Vandenberg Air Force Base.The GDP Space Systems Model MD2365A-08 Multi-Channel PCI Bit Synchronizer Subsystem ispart of the new LSP telemetry system. Custom in-house software to command and monitor theGDP Bit synchronizer is complete and tested. Only the GDP Model MD2365A-08 Multi-ChannelPCI Bit Synchronizer Subsystem will work with this custom in-house software. The use ofanother company's bit synchronizer would require significant modification of existingcustom software.The cost to generate software to interface the LSP Telemetry architecture with anothermanufacture's bit synchronizer will be cost and time prohibitive. Extensive testing hasalready been performed to validate LSP Telemetry's data processing software thatinterfaces with the GDP Model MD2365A-08 Multi-Channel PCI Bit Synchronizer Subsystem.Any changes in our software architecture will invalidate the extensive testing that hasalready been performed. The delay required to re-perform validation testing is notpractical considering the Launch Services Program's current launch schedule.The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12 and 13. Interestedorganizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort inwriting to the identified point of contact not later than 12:00 P.M. local time onFebruary 6, 2012.

Such capabilities/qualifications will beevaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct thisprocurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete thisproposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to thisnotice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are NOTacceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer whichshall be considered by the agency.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>52.212-2 EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) <br />(a) The Government will award one (1) contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government (Best Value), price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: <br />- In order of importance</p>
<p>(1)AVAILABILITY AND QUALIFICATION OF KEY PERSONNEL; Resumes, Certifications <br />(2)SECTION 2, EXHIBIT: EHS CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS SUBMITTALS <br />(3)PAST PERFORMANCE/REFERENCES<br />(4)COMPARABLE EXPERIENCE<br />(5)PLAN OF OPERATIONS AND MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE<br />SUB-FACTOR A: PHASE IN/OUT PLAN<br />SUB-FACTOR B: QUALITY CONTROL PLAN<br />(6)PRICE</p>
<p><br />(c)Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>For this solicitation, technical merit is more important than cost or price. Award will not be automatically determined by numerical calculation or formula relationship between cost or price and technical merit. As technical merit of the offeror's' proposals becomes more equal, the evaluated cost or price may become the determining factor. The Contracting Officer shall determine what trade-off between technical merit and cost or price promises the greatest value to the Government, cost or price and other factors considered.</p>
<p>The Government may conduct a price reasonableness evaluation in order to determine if the overall price<br />proposed is fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>Note: Award of this contract may be made based on the initial quotation/proposal and without holding discussions. However, the Government reserves the right to hold discussions if it is determined to be in the best interest of the Government. Offeror's are cautioned to submit their proposal on the most favorable basis, since the Government reserves the right to make an award without further negotiations or discussions.</p>
<p><br />RATING METHODOLOGY <br /><br />All factors will be adjectivally rated as Outstanding, Good, Acceptable, and Unacceptable,with the exception of Past Performance which may be rated neutral*</p>
<p>The following definitions will be used for the rating categories:</p>
<p>The Government Evaluation Team members will independently rate the strengths and weaknesses of each Offeror's technical proposal information. Each of the developed <br />evaluation factors will be adjectivally rated as Outstanding, Good, Acceptable, or Un-acceptable, with Outstanding representing the highest possible rating and Unacceptable representing the lowest possible rating. Only the Past Performance factor may be rated as neutral. The following definitions will be used for the rating categories:</p>
<p>&bull;OUTSTANDING - The Evaluation Factor response is expected to contribute to the Superior achievement of the objectives with minimal or no risk. An assigned rating of <br />OUTSTANDING indicates that, in terms of the specific factor, sub factor, or element,the submission contains very significant strengths and no weaknesses.</p>
<p>&bull;GOOD - The Evaluation Factor response is expected to introduce minimal risk in achieving the objectives. A GOOD rating indicates that, in terms of the specific factor, sub factor, or element, the submission contains considerable strengths, but also some weaknesses.</p>
<p>&bull;ACCEPTABLE - The Evaluation Factor response is expected to introduce minimal to moderate risk in achieving the objectives. An ACCEPTABLE rating indicates that, in terms <br />of the specific factor, the submission contains weaknesses that offset strengths, but do not<br />significantly detract from the submission. A rating of ACCEPTABLE is used when there are no indications of exceptional features or innovations that could prove to be beneficial and no major weaknesses that could diminish the quality of the effort or increase the risks <br />of failure.</p>
<p>&bull;UNACCEPTABLE - The Evaluation Factor response is expected to introduce moderate To excessive risk making it highly unlikely that performance would meet the objectives. An UNACCEPTABLE rating indicates that, in terms of the specific factor, sub factor, or element, the submission contains significant weaknesses that are not offset by strengths.The Offeror's interpretation of the Government's objective is superficial, incomplete, <br />vague, incompatible, incomprehensible or incorrect that it is considered unacceptable.</p>
<p>&bull;NEUTRAL* - No relevant past performance available for evaluation. * This rating shall only be applied to the PAST PERFORMANCE factor. A NEUTRAL rating is neither favorable nor unfavorable.</p>
<p>Assigned ratings will reflect the consensus developed by the evaluation team's assessment <br />of the technical proposal for accomplishing the Government's objectives.</p>
<p>Price proposals will be evaluated but not rated.</p>

In the event of exclusions or over-and-above work, the contractor will be required to submit an equipment condition report to the Contracting Officer detailing the finding and a listing of the additional parts and labor necessary to return the equipment to serviceable condition. Non-re-workable items replaced during modification/overhaul shall be disposed of as scrap.

<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation HSCG85-12-Q-DST243 for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This Request for Proposal incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-32. This is small business set-aside procurement. The NAICS is 326299.
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (CG-9131), U.S.Coast Guard Headquarters, Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurement, 1900 Half St. SW, Room 11-0402, Washington, DC. 20593, Telephone (202) 3723692, Fax: (202) 475, 3904.</p>

 E.2  	FAR 52.209-5  CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (APR 2010)
 
   (a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -
 
       (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -
 
         (A) Are [ ] are not [ ] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;
 
         (B) Have [ ] have not [ ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for:  commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have," the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation);
 
         (C) Are [ ] are not [ ] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in subdivision (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and
 
         (D) Have [ ], have not [ ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
 
           (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
 
             (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
 
             (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
 
           (2) Examples.
 
             (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
 
             (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
 
             (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
 
             (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
 
             (ii) The Offeror has [ ] has not [ ], within a 3-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.
 
     (2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).
 
   THIS CERTIFICATION CONCERNS A MATTER WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF AN AGENCY OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE MAKING OF A FALSE, FICTITIOUS, OR FRAUDULENT CERTIFICATION MAY RENDER THE MAKER SUBJECT TO PROSECUTION UNDER SECTION 1001, TITLE 18, UNITED STATES CODE.
 
   (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.
 
   (c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation.  However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility.  Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.
 
   (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision.  The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.
 
   (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award.  If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

For line items covered by the WTO GPA, the Government will evaluate offers of U.S.-made or designated country end products without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American Act.

  (h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689).  (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified  acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge  and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--

    (1) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;

    (2) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal  criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;

    (3) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission
of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and

    (4) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes  in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains  unsatisfied.

      (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:

        (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not  finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial  challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.

        (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when  full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in  cases where enforced collection action is precluded.

      (ii) Examples. 

        (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

        (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a  hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing,  and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to  sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the  taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.  Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal  rights.

        (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement  pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The  taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

        (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The  taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
    
  (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

    (1) Listed end products.

      (ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR  22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii));

      (iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a  monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an  annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month)  servicing the Government contract; and

      (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all  service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.

    (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies--

    (1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

    (2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

<p>CAR 1352.271-71 Method of Payment and Invoicing Instructions for Ship Repair (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a) The Government will make payment under this contract based on a percentage of completion. The contractor may invoice for the percentage completed for each work item as work progresses. The amount invoiced shall be calculated based on prices stated in the Schedule, as follows: A work item may not be invoiced until the percentage complete reaches 25 percent. Future invoices for that work item have no limitation as to the percentage of completion required before invoicing, but in no event may invoices be submitted more frequently than every 2 weeks, or for amounts less than $10,000, unless it is the final payment. The minimum percentage of completion (25%) to be reached prior to billing each work item may be waived by the Contracting Officer for large dollar work items on a case-by-case basis.<br />(b) Invoices submitted by the contractor which are deemed not proper, in accordance with FAR 52.232-25, will be returned. Invoices shall include: <br />(1) Name and Address of the contractor;<br />(2) DUNS Number;<br />(3) Invoice Date;<br />(4) Contract Number/Modification Number;<br />(5) CLIN/Work Item Number, to include: Description, Quantity, Unit of Measure, Unit Price and Extended Price;<br />(6) Shipping and Payment Terms; and, <br />(7) Contractor Point of Contact, including: Name, Title, Phone Number, and Mailing Address;<br />(8) The percentage of completion for each CLIN/work item identified;<br />(9) Name of the Contracting Officer;<br />(10) Ship name;<br />(11) The overall percentage and dollar amount previously billed, currently billed and unbilled.<br />(c) When invoicing for changed work, the contractor shall identify it as a contract change and shall identify the modification authorizing the change, and the CLIN/Work Item associated with the change.<br />(d) All items of work invoiced under this contract will be verified and confirmed by the Contracting Officer's Representative as accurate and complete and approved by the designated billing office before payment will be made. <br />(e) Mail the original invoice to: (To be determined at time of award)<br />(f) The contractor's final invoice submitted under the contract must be marked as follows: &#61618;THIS INVOICE CONSTITUTES THE FINAL INVOICE - UPON PAYMENT OF THIS INVOICE NO OTHER MONIES ARE DUE UNDER CONTRACT NUMBER _____________________."(To be assigned at contract award)<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>CAR 1352.271-72 Additional Item Requirements (AIRs) - Growth Work (APR 2010)</p>
<p>(a) This clause applies to Additional Item Requirements (AIR), also known as growth and emergent work ordered by the Contracting Officer pursuant to the Changes - Ship Repair clause or mutually agreed upon by the parties. The contractor shall perform AIR at the labor billing rates designated in the Schedule, as described in paragraph (c) of this clause. The AIR handling fee designated in the Schedule shall be the sole fee used for direct material purchases and subcontractor handling. The estimated quantity of labor hours and handling fees represent the Government's best estimate for growth that may be required throughout the contract performance period. All growth work shall be paid at the prices stated in the Schedule.<br />(b) The contractor shall take into account the potential for ordering all estimated AIR quantities in developing the Production Schedule. The ordering of any portion of the AIR quantities does not in itself warrant an extension to the original contract completion date; however, for planning purposes, the Government anticipates ordering AIR in accordance with the following schedule: <br />(1) No more than 75% of the hours during the first half of the contract period of performance. <br />(2) No more than 50% of the hours during the third quarter of the contract period of performance. <br />(3) No more than 30% of the hours during the fourth quarter of the contract period of performance.<br />(c) The AIR labor rate shall be a flat, hourly rate to cover the entire effort and shall be burdened to include: <br />(1) Direct production labor hour functions only. Direct production labor hours are hours of skilled labor at the journeyman level expended in direct production. Direct production is defined as work performed by a qualified craftsman that is directly related to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. The following functions are identified as direct production: Abrasive Cleaning/Water Blasting, Tank Cleaning, Welding, Burning, Brazing, Blacksmithing, Machining (inside and outside), Carpentry, Electrical/Electronic Work, Crane Operation, Shipfitting, Lagging/Insulating, Painting, Boilermaking, Pipe Fitting, Engineering (Production), Sheetmetal Work, Staging/Scaffolding, and Rigging. <br />(2) Non-production labor hours (whether charged directly or indirectly by contractor's accounting system) shall be for labor in support of production functions. For purposes of this clause, support functions are defined as functions that do not directly contribute to the alteration, modification, or repair of the item or system identified as needing alteration, modification, or repair. Necessary support functions should be priced into the burdened rate for production labor hours. Examples of support functions include: Testing, Quality Assurance (inspection), Engineering (support), Planning (including involvement of craft foreman/journeyman in planning a task), Estimating (including determination of necessary materials and equipment needed to perform a task), Material Handling, Set-up (moving tools and equipment from shop to ship to perform a task), Fire Watch, General Labor (including general support of journeyman tasks), Cleaning (including debris pickup and removal), Surveying, Security, Transportation, Supervision, and Lofting (sail/pattern making).<br />(d) Additional Item Requirements do not include replacement work performed pursuant to the Inspection and Manner of Doing Work or Guarantees clauses.<br />(e) It is the Government's intention to award any growth work identified during the repair to the contractor, if a fair and reasonable price can be negotiated for such work, based upon Schedule rates. If a fair and reasonable price cannot be negotiated, the Government may, at its discretion, obtain services outside of the contract.

(a)  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:
     (i) TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF THE ITEM TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT    (ii) ABILITY TO MEET REQUIRED DELIVERY DATE(S) AND FOB TERMS   (iii) PRICE	
Ability to meet both technical capability and the ability to meet the required delivery schedule represent MINIMUM criteria for acceptable award.  Failure to meet one of these two criteria shall render the offer to be technically unacceptable and not considered for award. 
Offeror's commercial product brochures or technical information shall be used to make a determination of whether the offeror meets the technical capability requirements.  Offerors shall, therefore, provide information that clearly demonstrates their ability to meet the technical capability requirements.
The Government's required delivery schedule/date(s) is 16 Apr 2012.  Ability to meet the stated required delivery schedule/date(s) and FOB terms shall be demonstrated by the offeror's submission of a signed offer which has not taken exception to the required delivery schedule/date or place of delivery.  Offers which take exception and do not meet the stated Government required delivery schedule/date(s) and FOB terms may be determined to be unacceptable and not considered for award.
Award will be made to that responsible offeror which meets both of the above minimum technical and schedule requirements and offers the lowest price. 
(b)  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<DESC><p>In Accordance with FAR 6.302-1 this a limited competition for technical services in support of JAWS.&nbsp; <br /><br />TRICARE Management Activity<br />Contract Operations Division - Falls Church<br /><br /><br />Description:<br /><br />JAWS Technical Services:<br />JAWS Technical Services are required for 42 Federal employees to ensure successful implementation and integration of potentially complex software using their already provided JAWS software. The government has purchased the software for the 42 Federal Workers as a form of a mandatory reasonable accommodation per Equal Employment Opportunity laws. Jaws Technical Services allows for integration of the Jaws Screen reader with the user's interface of the agency's applications. For example, if the employee's agency is using web based user interfaces, the Jaws configuration may need to be told to read the title attributes instead of the "alt" attributes. The JAWS software is the only screen reader program certified for networks throughout the DOD and CAP's partner agencies, such as the Navy's NMCI network. Providing technical services are essential for employees to successful meet their necessary job tasks. The government is therefore restricting this competition to only those providers with training expertise in JAWS. Certified Trainers of JAWS is preferred. <br /><br />Estimated Amount: $42,537.42<br /><br />FAR 6.302-1<br /><br />Contractor must provide JAWS Technical Services<br /><br />Offers will be consider from all vendors who provide JAWS Technical Services<br /><br />We estimate the price to be Fair &amp; resonable<br /><br />There is sufficent vendors to provide JAWS technical services and it will not unduly effect competition.<br /><br /></p>

Previous testing at the ERDC has identified rapid-setting flowable fill as a potential solution to backfill damaged pavements providing minimal interruption of operation.<br><br>Work<br>One hundred and twenty eight (128) cubic yards of rapid-setting flowable fill are required to backfill 18 simulated bomb craters at the ERDC Poor House testing facility. Materials will be evaluated using both the traditional wet-mixed method and the accelerated dry-placement method. The traditional method includes the use of fixed volume "drum type" or volumetric mixers. The dry-placement method involves dispensing the aggregate-cementitious blend directly into the prepared excavation and metering the required mix-water over the backfill surface. The mix-water is allowed to percolate through the dry material matrix, hydrating the cementitious materials, providing a hardened layer with the properties of in-place flowable fill. ERDC researchers will examine the current rapid repair methods in addition to developing optimized procedures that minimize labor intensity, manpower, equipment, and construction time requirements. <br><br>Specifications<br>1.	Capability to be placed using both the traditional wet-mixed and dry-placement methods.<br>2.	Ultimate 28-day compressive strength of 750 to 1,200 psi determined in accordance with ASTM International standard test method ASTM D 4832 when placed using the traditional method.<br>3.	Seventy percent (70%) or more of the ultimate 28-day compressive strength must be achieved when placed using the dry-placement method.<br>4.	Initial hardening must be completed in 30 minutes or less determined in accordance with ASTM D 6024.<br>5.	Flow consistency of 8 to 12 inches determined in accordance with ASTM D 6103 when placed using the traditional method.<br>6.	Minimal segregation (< 5%) of solid and liquid mixture proportions determined in accordance with ASTM C 1610 when placed using the traditional method.<br>7.	Minimal linear shrinkage (< 2%) of hardened specimens determined in accordance with ASTM C 426 when placed using the traditional method.<br><br>Requirements<br>1.	Results of standardized testing, material safety data sheet (MSDS), and optimal mix-water proportions for both the traditional and dry-placement methods must be provided to the technical point of contact (POC) within 30 days of awarding contract.<br>2.	The rapid-setting flowable fill must be packaged in one cubic yard lots capable of uncovered outdoor storage for 36 to 60 months.<br>3.	Two hundred pounds (200 lb) of rapid-setting flowable fill packaged in sealed 5-gallon buckets must be provided in addition to the 128 cubic yards of required material to allow for laboratory verification of standardized testing results.<br>4.	The contractor is responsible for shipping the rapid-setting flowable fill to the ERDC in Vicksburg, MS.<br>5.	Materials shall be received by the ERDC no later than February 13, 2012.<br><br>FAR Provision 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. Award shall be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal is determined to be Lowest Price Technically Acceptable in accordance with Clause 52.212-2 Evaluation -Commercial Items.

<DESC>C2IS and C2AOS are companion programs intended to develop, field, and sustain modular net-centric Command and Control (C2) applications and data management solutions for current and future C2 systems that are not planned or delivered by systems of record (SoR). As such, C2IS and C2AOS will address many of the functional requirements that are currently met by the operationally-fielded Theater Battle Management Core System-Force Level (TBMCS-FL). C2IS and C2AOS will deliver software capabilities intended to execute on an "externally-provided" infrastructure such as the Air Force's Air and Space Operations Center (AOC) Weapon System (WS), AN/USQ 163, or the Navy's Consolidated Afloat Networks and Enterprise Services (CANES). C2IS and C2AOS alone and/or together do not yield "systems" but rather contribute distinct capabilities and functionality to "host systems" that are managed or provided by other programs. NOTE: Please disregard previous information posted on the Command and Control Air Operation Suite page. For updated information on C2IS/C2AOS please refer to this page.

Question: With regards to Page 66, (1) Subfactor A - Corporate Capability, (a) Corporate Certifications, Can the requirements for offeror corporate certifications (AS9110, AS9100, ISO 9001, ISO 14001, and FAA 145) be met collectively by a proposing team, i.e. can a combination of prime contractor, partners and/or subcontractors certifications meet these requirements?<br><br>Answer:  ISO 14001 will be deleted.  ISO 9001:2008 needs to be a basic quality requirement that needs to be met by the prime, partners and subcontractors.  <br><br>AS9100 and AS 9110 must be met by the prime contractor.<br><br>FAA 145 may be met by the prime, partners and/or subcontractors.  The Government recognizes that the FAA part 145 certificate may need to be subsequently updated to include rotary and fixed wing platforms covered by the LSFMA contract.<br><br><br>3.	Question: With regards to Page 66, (1) Subfactor A - Corporate Capability, (a) Corporate Certifications, If a prime offeror has performed relevant work as a significant subcontractor under a prime contractor's certifications for a relevant contract, will the Government accept other substantiation as a substitution for being certified?<br><br>Answer: No.   AS 9100 and AS9110 require certified processes for the specific contractor performing the work. Using work performed under another contractors certified processes will not be acceptable.  (See also Question 2)<br><br>4.	Question: With regards to Page 66, (1) Subfactor A - Corporate Capability, (a) Corporate Certifications, Can any of the certifications be obtained after contract award?<br><br>Answer: No.  All certifications must be obtained prior to contract award as they are part of the evaluation process.<br><br>5.	Question: With regards to Page 66, (1) Subfactor A - Corporate Capability, (a) Corporate Certifications, Will the Government consider giving evaluation credit for individual certifications rather than a go/no go evaluation for all of them collectively?<br><br>Answer: No<br><br>6.	Item B-0004 and clause at H-12 require manpower reporting but website (https://contractormanpower.army.pentagon.mil) appears to be incorrect.  Please clarify.<br><br>Answer: Yes, the correct website is https://cmra.army.mil.<br><br>7.	Para H-20.d says definitization of Over&Above items will be based on "the composite labor rate cited in Section B" but no requirement exists in Section B to include a composite labor rate.  Please clarify intent.<br><br>Answer: Over and Above labor costs will utilize the labor rates incorporated into the awarded contract.  Further information provided in RFP.<br><br>8.	Para L-31.2.c lists page limits for the various volumes.  It grants an exception for AS9110 and AS9011 audit results as well as for offeror procedures (e.g., Ground/Flight Procedures).  Is the table of contents included within the page count limits?<br><br>Answer:  No.  Table of contents pages in any volume should be numbered  using roman numerals.  These pages will not be in the page count and not subject to evaluation. (See also question 18)<br><br>9.	Para L-31.3.b.1.b.1.c after subpara (v) near bottom of page requires an organization chart of non-TI quality personnel "and data interaction."  Please clarify intent of data interaction.<br><br>Answer: This is requesting an organizational chart and corresponding flow chart of how quality work is processed (e.g., who uses the quality information, who reviews and approves, and what decisions are made from the quality information).<br><br>10.	Para L-31.3.b.1.b.1.c refers to "...the proposed quality management support approach contained in the overarching Performance Work Statement (PWS)" yet no quality requirements are specified in the PWS.  Please clarify.<br><br>Answer: The quality requirements are outlined in Section E of the draft RFP.<br><br>11.	Para L-31.3.b.1.b.1.c.v requests information on "demonstrated throughput ratio (reviews/day)."  Request clarification on requirement or its intent.<br><br>Answer: This is only applicable with respect to maintenance and production "line" activities (i.e., when manufacturing or performing significantly repeatable and measurable tasks, quality data should be taken, tracked, and analyzed in accordance with some quantifiable action (reviews/inspections per day or reviews/inspections per system or reviews/inspections per action).  It is the Government's intent to determine the method of measurement standard used.<br><br>12.	Para M-3.a refers to the "mission capability volume" and M-3.c refers to the "mission capability proposal".  Please confirm that both references are to the "Corporate Capability" section of the Technical Volume.<br><br>Answer: This is a typographical error, the reference should be to the technical volume (all parts).<br><br>13.	 CDRL: Block 5 (Contract Reference) refers to paragraph 4.0 of the PWS which does not exist.  Recommend changing to paragraph 3.0.<br><br>Answer: This was a typographical error.  Block 5 will be revised to refer to paragraph 3.0 of the PWS.<br><br>14.	CDRL: Block 16 (remarks) includes tailoring of the content but references it to Blocks 12 and 13 (submission dates).  Recommend the section starting with "Format to contain... and Estimate to complete" be referenced to Block 4 instead of Blocks 12 and 13.<br><br>Answer:  No changes will be made to the CDRL.<br><br>15.	Is it a requirement that the Prime Contractor hold all of the certifications below, or is it acceptable that some of these requirements be met by a Subcontractor teammember?<br><br>E-7 52.246-11 HIGHER-LEVEL CONTRACT QUALITY REQUIREMENT FEB/1999<br><br>Insert AS9100, AS9110, ISO9001:2008, ISO 14001, and FAA 145 in the blanks within the above referenced clause.<br><br>TITLE                     NUMBER        DATE TAILORING<br><br>QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS AS9100(REV C) 2009 N/A<br><br>AEROSPACE - QMS REQUIREMENTS FOR MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATIONS AS9110(REV A) 2009 N/A<br><br>QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS ISO 9001:2008 2008 N/A<br><br>ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT STANDARD ISO 14001 CURRENT N/A<br><br>FAA REPAIR STATION FAA 145 CURRENT N/A<br><br>Answer: (See also Question 2)  <br>ISO 14001 is deleted as a quality requirement.  <br>ISO 9001:2008 The requirement must be held by the prime, partners and subcontractors.<br>AS9100 and AS 9110.  These quality standards are specific to aviation, the first standard is aviation manufacturing and the second is maintenance/modification of Aviation.  Both are specific to the LSF requirement and are pertinent to performance. There is a need for oversight of contractor facilities to include their procedures and processes from an airworthiness standpoint to insure the work is being done in a proper manner. In a competitive process, especially with an ordering contract, it is necessary to insure that the successful contractor has the appropriate procedures and processes in place at their facility. This allows the Government to know that any work performed under those standards will comply with Airworthiness and safety requirements. This necessitates evaluating the quality provision and processes in the source selection.  The Government has<br>chosen the existing industry standards AS9100 and AS9110 that are directly applicable to the contract requirement. The requirements must be met by the prime contractor.<br><br>FAA Part 145 may be met by the prime or a subcontractor. The Government recognizes that the FAA part 145 certificate may need to be subsequently updated to include rotary and fixed wing platforms covered by the LSFMA contract.<br><br>16.	Question:  Reference L-31.3a) Page 65 - RFP Proposal files Section lists only the allowable page size as 8.5" x 11".  Will the Government allow 11" x 17" foldouts for graphics?<br><br>Answer: No.  <br><br>17.	Question: L-31.3a)(2) Page 65 - Third sentence in this paragraph states "Each file of the proposal shall consist of a Table of Contents, Summary Section, and the Narratives discussion". Is the term "file" to be considered the same as volume?  If so, are all these items required for each volume including volume IV?<br><br>Answer: Yes.  <br><br>18.	Question:  L-31.3a)(2) Page 65 - Third sentence in this paragraph states "Each file of the proposal shall consist of a Table of Contents, Summary Section, and the Narrative discussion".  Is the required Table of Contents and Summary Section in each file excluded from the maximum page count in volumes I and III?<br><br>Answer: No.  (See Also Question 8.)<br><br>19.	Question:  L-31.3d)(4) Page 70 - The new corporate entities discussion addresses submitting prior contract data from officers and employees.  It does not allow data from new entities such as JVs.  Will the Government allow prior and current contract data to be submitted from Joint Ventures?  If so, will they allow each JV member to submit the same line of three contracts as shown for prime offerors stated in L-31.3d)?<br><br>Answer: For any new joint venture that has no past performance, the entities comprising the joint venture  may submit individual past performance data.  The Government does not understand the second question.  <br><br>20.	Question:  L-31.3b)(2)-(4) - When does the Government anticipate releasing Sample Tasks 1,2, and 3?<br><br>Answer: The sample tasks 1,2 and 3 will be released when the draft RFP becomes the final version.<br><br>21.	Question:  How long will the response period be for the Final RFP scheduled for release on or about Feb 15 2012?<br><br>Answer: The contractors will have 45 days from the date the Final RFP is released to submit their proposals.<br><br>22.	Question: L-31.3.b)(e) Page 68 - One of the management positions identified in this section does not have a corresponding labor category listed in attachment 0004, "Minimum Requirements for Labor Categories".  Will the Government provide the expected roles and duties for the LSF Facility Director?<br><br>Answer:  No<br><br>23.	Attachment 0004, Minimum Requirements for Labor Categories - The experience requirement for the Director of Safety /Safety Manager states that a person must have Instrument Instructor Experience.  This does not appear to be appropriate for a logistics support facility contract which provides aircraft modification/engineering activities.  Will the Government remove the Instrument Instructor experience requirement?  Suggest experience as Maintenance Test Pilot be substituted for Instrument Instructor.<br><br>Answer: Attachment 0004 will be revised to remove the Instrument Instructor Experience requirement.<br><br>24.	L-31.3.d)  and M-4.C.3 - Both these RFP sections state that submitted contracts must/should be in current performance or "awarded" during the past 3 years.  Putting a time limit on contracts awarded within the past 3 years severely limits the usable contracts available for most bidders.  Will the Government change the "awarded" requirement to the more standard solicitation requirement of "completed" within the past 3 years?<br><br>Answer: These sections will be revised to show "awarded and/or completed" during the past 3 years.<br><br> <br><br>

<DESC><p>PBGC: Financial Analyst &amp; Related Services <br />Agency: Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation</p>
<p>Synopsis</p>
<p>PBGC's Department of Insurance Supervision and Compliance (DISC) requires financial analyst services to support DISC's daily operations. PBGC requires that the work be performed on site at PBGC's headquarters. The background and a brief description of the work follows.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>PBGC is a federal agency that guarantees payment of private pension benefits when companies and pension plans fail. It protects some 44 million Americans in over 27,500 private defined benefit pension plans. The PBGC pays benefits using insurance premiums and assets and other recoveries from plans and their sponsors; it receives no taxpayer funds.</p>
<p>Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), plan sponsors and their controlled group members (loosely defined as parents, subsidiaries and affiliated companies) are jointly and severally liable for making minimum required contributions to their pension plans. When a pension plan terminates, plan sponsors and controlled group members are liable to PBGC for the unfunded benefit liabilities (UBL) associated with the terminated plan. The UBL is the difference between the plan's assets and liabilities as determined on the date the plan is terminated.</p>
<p>DISC is the department within PBGC that monitors the activities of pension plan sponsors and their controlled group members to determine whether those activities pose a risk to their pension plans. When risks are identified, DISC takes steps to mitigate those risks. When pension plan termination is appropriate under sections 4041 or 4042 of ERISA, DISC prepares the analysis and other paperwork necessary to terminate the plans and then seeks to recover termination liabilities, including UBL, from the former plan sponsors and their controlled group members.</p>
<p>PBGC currently has a contract for financial analyst services that is in the last year of its five-year term. PBGC seeks to award a similar contract for another term of up to five years (base year, plus four option years). The contract will require the contractor to provide both financial analyst services and related services, to include supporting DISC's efforts to revise reports, processes, and procedures to better mitigate risk to existing pension plans and to maximize recoveries for terminated plans.</p>
<p>Brief Description of the Work Required</p>
<p>The work to be performed by the contractor will include -</p>
<p>&bull; Monitoring the activities of pension plan sponsors and their controlled group members <br />to identify and analyze risks</p>
<p>&bull; Supporting PBGC's staff in risk-mitigation activities</p>
<p>&bull; Documenting risk-mitigation activities, to include settlement agreements</p>
<p>&bull; Reviewing requests to voluntarily terminate pension plans under section 4041 of ERISA,<br />to include -</p>
<p>&bull; Obtaining additional detailed information from the plan sponsor and controlled group members necessary to analyze the request</p>
<p>&bull; Analyzing the plan sponsor's and controlled group members' financial situations to determine whether termination appears appropriate</p>
<p>&bull; Presenting recommendations to PBGC officials for review and approval</p>
<p>&bull; Documenting voluntary termination decisions</p>
<p>&bull; When PBGC determines that involuntary termination of a pension plan may be <br />appropriate under section 4042 of ERISA -</p>
<p>&bull; Obtaining detailed information from the plan sponsor and controlled group members necessary to analyze the proposed termination</p>
<p>&bull; Analyzing the plan sponsor's and controlled group members' financial situations to determine whether termination appears appropriate</p>
<p>&bull; Presenting recommendations to PBGC officials for review and approval</p>
<p>&bull; Documenting involuntary termination decisions</p>
<p>&bull; Assisting in recovering termination liabilities from former plan sponsors and controlled <br />group members under sections 4062, 4063, 4064, 4067, and 4068 of ERISA to include -</p>
<p>&bull; Drafting memoranda in support of recovery activities</p>
<p>&bull; Analyzing the former plan sponsor's and controlled group members' capacity to pay termination liabilities</p>
<p>&bull; Supporting negotiations</p>
<p>&bull; Documenting settlement decisions</p>
<p>&bull; Preparing lien memoranda for internal use</p>
<p>&bull; Supporting DISC's continuing efforts to enhance its reporting, processes, and procedures</p>

<DESC>**The purpose of Amendment 004 is to revise the SIR as shown in the enclosed Errata Sheet.  Concurrent with this amendment, the FAA is publishing the questions received from industry and their applicable responses from the Government.
Additionally, the FAA has now included in this announcement a spreadsheet for interested offerors desiring to network for potential subcontracting opportunities.  Any potential offeror interested in having their information added to the list must complete the attached form and return it to Robert Taylor, Contract Specialist, via electronic mail at robert.c.taylor-ii@faa.gov no later than February 3, 2012.  The completed interested offeror list will be posted on the FAA Contract Opportunities site on February 7, 2012.  The list will be provided on an informational basis, and in no way should this information imply or be construed as endorsement by the FAA for any product, service, or enterprise in connection with any of the listed vendor information.  
The FAA plans to proceed with the scheduled telecom tomorrow, February 2, 2012, at 2:00 p.m., EST.  Please note that this telecom is optional and not a mandatory event for potential offerors. Also, the principal purpose of this telecom is to review the Government's response to select questions received from vendors.  No new information is intended to be disclosed.  Therefore, no transcript or written record of the telecom will be provided following the event. **
**The purpose of Amendment 003 is to correct the file attachment named "Section L - Amendment 001" that was provided with Amendment 002.  The revised file attachment named "Section L - Amendment 003" makes the file name consistent with this solicitation amendment number 003 and it updates the document header text to be "DTFAWA-11-R-00023 Amendment 003."  The previous document named "Section L - Amendment 001" is replaced in its entirety with the attached file named "Section L - Amendment 003."**
**The purpose of Amendment 002 is to inform industry of a two week delay in the release of the Question and Answer (Q&A's) responses.  The Q & A's will now be published on Wednesday, February 1, 2012. 
Amendment 002 also provides the rescheduled date information for the interested bidder's teleconference.  The teleconference is now scheduled for Thursday, February 2, 2012, at 2:00 p.m., EST.
Finally, Amendment 002 includes a revised Section L - Instructions, Conditions and Notices to Offerors and updates the proposal response date to no later than 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Thursday, February 16, 2012.  The prior document "Section L" is replaced in its entirety by Section L - Amendment 002.**

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Air Traffic Facility Security Risk Management Program (FSRM) office has a requirement for security officer services throughout the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii and U.S. Territories.  These services are being procured in order to provide physical security safeguards for FAA employees, facilities, and United States Government property and assets from loss, theft, damage, unauthorized use, criminal acts, espionage, sabotage and terrorism.
Scope of Effort:  This Screening Information Request/Request  for Offer (SIR) is for Security Officer (SO) Services within the Eastern Service Area.  A complete listing of included facilities can be found in Section B of the SIR.  The Contractor must furnish all labor, supervision, materials, equipment, transportation, training, and management necessary to provide SO services in accordance with the stated requirements. The Contractor must implement all necessary scheduling and personnel and equipment control procedures to ensure timely accomplishment of all SO service requirements
The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code  to this effort is 561612 Security Guard and Patrol Services with the size standard of $18.5 Million.
In order to provide opportunities for the small businesses and to ensure the FAA requirements are met, the acquisition strategy for this procurement includes the use of a tiered evaluation of offerors with the following tiers:
I.	8(a) CompaniesII.	SDVOSBIII.	Small BusinessesIV.	Large Businesses
(1) Tiered evaluation of offers is a process by which FAA promotes small business participation while providing the FAA a means to continue the procurement if small business participation is insufficient.
(2) The FAA may use tiered evaluation of offers to promote competition in each tier of small business concerns while still allowing other than small business to participate without issuing another SIR.
(3) The FAA will consider the tiers of small business concerns prior to evaluating offers from other than small business concerns.
All business classifications will be encouraged to submit offers for this SIR.  The FAA will proceed with the evaluation of offerors and award within the lowest tier found to contain adequate competition among technically acceptable offers.  An offer is considered technically acceptable if:
1) The offer is not grossly or obviously deficient; and2) The offer receives at least a marginal evaluation rating in the management, technical and past performance factors.  
Adequate competition exists when at least two offers are compared. If only one proposal is received in a lower tier, this offer from a lower tier may compete with higher tiered submissions in order to achieve adequate competition
Each offeror may be considered as a prime contractor for only one Service Area (SA) award but has the ability to pursue subcontracting opportunities on any service area awards without restriction.  The FAA will only recognize one Prime Contractor per offer.  In accordance with AMS clause 3.6.1-7 Limitations on Subcontracting  at least 50% of the work must be performed by employees of the Prime contractor Award for awards made under the first three tiers.  
The resulting award will be Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (FFP IDIQ) with one Time and Material (T&M) Contract Line Item (CLIN) and a period of performance of one base year and four one year options to begin on October 1, 2012.
In order to maximize competition and to address concerns raised by the vendor community, significant changes have been made to the SIR since it was released in draft form on June 15, 2011. The largest concentration of changes can be found in Section C, Statement of Work (SOW), and in Section M, Evaluation of Offers.  
As part of the FAA Small Business Conference, a briefing was presented on July 18, 2011 that provided attendees an overview of the program contract strategy for the National Security Officer Program.  This briefing is also attached to this announcement.
Questions or comments pertaining to this SIR must be submitted in written form via email to Robert C. Taylor II, Contract Specialist, at robert.c.taylor-ii@faa.gov.no later than 2:00 p.m., January 5, 2012.  Questions and responses that clarify the SIR may be provided to all Offerors; however the source of the questions will not be identified.  
The FAA plans to publish responses to questions on February 1, 2012, and host a teleconference with interested parties on February 2, 2012, at 2:00 p.m. EST.  Due to the limited availability of dial in access lines, interested parties are requested to limit representation to one dial in access per company. 
Teleconference details are as follows:Dial In: 202-493-4180  Passcode: 8176The dial in information remains the same as originally stated in the SIR.
Please be advised, Attachment J.2, Facility Post Orders, and J.3, Facility Post Exhibits, are being distributed in a generic format.  Due to the sensitivity of the site specific information associated with Attachment J.2, Facility Post Orders, Sensitive Unclassified Information (SUI) will be released to the awardee.

Please note the acknowledgement requirements found in item 11 of this amendment.**

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Air Traffic Facility Security Risk Management Program (FSRM) office has a requirement for security officer services throughout the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii and U.S. Territories.  These services are being procured in order to provide physical security safeguards for FAA employees, facilities, and United States Government property and assets from loss, theft, damage, unauthorized use, criminal acts, espionage, sabotage and terrorism.Scope of Effort:  This Screening Information Request/Request For Offer (SIR) is for Security Officer (SO) Services within the Western Service Area.  A complete listing of included facilities can be found in Section B of the SIR.  The Contractor must furnish all labor, supervision, materials, equipment, transportation, training, and management necessary to provide SO services in accordance with the stated requirements. The Contractor must implement all necessary scheduling and personnel and equipment control procedures to ensure timely accomplishment of all SO service requirements
 The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 561612 Security Guard and Patrol Services with the size standard of $18.5 Million.
In order to provide opportunities for the small businesses and to ensure the FAA requirements are met, the acquisition strategy for this procurement includes the use of a tiered evaluation of offerors with the following tiers:
I.	8(a) CompaniesII.	SDVOSBIII.	Small BusinessesIV.	Large Businesses
(1) Tiered evaluation of offers is a process by which FAA promotes small business participation while providing the FAA a means to continue the procurement if small business participation is insufficient.
(2) The FAA may use tiered evaluation of offers to promote competition in each tier of small business concerns while still allowing other than small business to participate without issuing another SIR.
(3) The FAA will consider the tiers of small business concerns prior to evaluating offers from other than small business concerns.
All business classifications will be encouraged to submit offers for this SIR.  The FAA will proceed with the evaluation of offerors and award within the lowest tier found to contain adequate competition among technically acceptable offers.  An offer is considered technically acceptable if:
1) The offer is not grossly or obviously deficient; and2) The offer receives at least a marginal evaluation rating in the management, technical and past performance factors.  
Adequate competition exists when at least two offers are compared. If only one proposal is received in a lower tier, this offer from a lower tier may compete with higher tiered submissions in order to achieve adequate competition
Each offeror may be considered as a prime contractor for only one Service Area (SA) award but has the ability to pursue subcontracting opportunities on any service area awards without restriction.  The FAA will only recognize one Prime Contractor per offer.  In accordance with AMS clause 3.6.1-7 Limitations on Subcontracting  at least 50% of the work must be performed by employees of the Prime contractor Award for awards made under the first three tiers.  
The resulting award will be Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (FFP IDIQ) with one Time and Material (T&M) Contract Line Item (CLIN) and a period of performance of one base year and four one year options to begin on October 1, 2012.
In order to maximize competition and to address concerns raised by the vendor community, significant changes have been made to the SIR since it was released in draft form on June 15, 2011. The largest concentration of changes can be found in Section C, Statement of Work (SOW), and in Section M, Evaluation of Offers.  
As part of the FAA Small Business Conference, a briefing was presented on July 18, 2011 that provided attendees an overview of the program contract strategy for the National Security Officer Program.  This briefing is also attached to this announcement.
Questions or comments pertaining to this SIR must be submitted in written form via email to Cynthia Birks, Contract Specialist, at cynthia.birks@faa.gov no later than 2:00 p.m., January 5, 2012.  Questions and responses that clarify the SIR may be provided to all Offerors; however the source of the questions will not be identified.  
The FAA plans to publish responses to questions on February 1, 2012, and host a teleconference with interested parties on February 2, 2012, at 2:00 p.m. EST.  Due to the limited availability of dial in access lines, interested parties are requested to limit representation to one dial in access per company. 
Teleconference details are as follows:Dial In: 202-493-4180  Passcode: 8176

Question 1: Can the Government provide a basis or justification for its choice of NAICS541712?  The NAICS code 541511 for Custom Computer Programming Services is moreappropriate.Answer1: After further review, we have determined that the NAICS code 541511 is thecorrect NAICS code for this procurement. The preponderance of the work falls under thisdescription. This U.S. industry comprises establishments primarily engaged in writing,modifying, testing, and supporting software to meet the needs of a particular customer.This also includes programming support services.Question 2: Please provide me the current contract number and incumbent.Answer 2: The current contract number is NNJ08HB13C and titled Program ControlConfiguration Management Support  (PCCMS). The incumbent is Bastion Technologies.Question 3: Can you confirm that this contract will be awarded via a streamlinedprocurement process? (The synopsis did not explicitly stipulate.)Answer 3: This procurement will be awarded via a streamlined procurement process. Seelink http://procurement.jsc.nasa.gov/geninfo.html    for Streamlined Procurement BriefingCharts for further description of process.Question 4: When do you think the PCMMS contract will be posted on the FOIA website?Answer 4:  Contracts are posted to the FOIA website after there are requests to see thecontract.Question 5: The synopsis states 100% set aside for 8A, does this mean that the 8A cannotpartner with a large company like Booz Allen for part of it?Answer 5: An 8a contractor can partner with a large company. The restrictions for thisprocurement are outlined in FAR 52.219-14,  Limitations on Subcontracting (Nov 2011),which states that by submission of an offer and execution of a contract, theOfferor/Contractor agrees that in performance of the contract for  Services (exceptconstruction),	at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred forpersonnel shall be expended for employees of the concern. JSC defines costs of contractperformance incurred for personnel to mean direct labor, labor overhead (includingpayroll taxes and benefits), and G&A.  Question 6:  What organization within MOD is responsible for managing the contract?Answer 6: The Management Integration Office (DA3) is responsible for managing thiscontract.Question 7: Could you please expand on "Project Information Systems" and "OfficeAutomated Systems" if different than what are already described in the notice? Also, ifthey consist of commercial software packages or tools, could you please identify all ofthem?  Answer 7:  The Mission Operations Directorate (MOD) project information system consistsof the following computer software applications and databases:	1)  Athena  MODs primary project information system/database application.2)  Integrated Enterprise Management (IEM) Core Financials (includes SAP)3)  IEM Business Warehouse (BW)4)  Space Program Integrated Contract Environment (SPICE)5)  Orion Integrated Resources Reporting (OIRR)6)  JSC Internal Task Agreements (ITAs)7)  Integrated Budget Office Toolbox (IBOT)Office Automated Systems (OAS) within MOD are the desktop or workstations (bundledcomputing platform (hardware and software) to meet most general computing needs of MODpersonnel to accomplish their work.  These desktop workstations are loaded withcommercial software packages (Microsoft Office) products.Question 8: Is it OK to assume that most required Configuration Management (CM) supportuses a Government furnished CM tool?  Could you please identify the CM tool, if so?  Answer 8: The Mission Operations Directorates (MODs) primary project informationsystem/database application is Athena.	Athena is a web-based data repository designed tointegrate various complex data sources and support for existing manual workflow processusing a central data repository for the analysis and reporting of MOD projectinformation.  Athena is the cost integration tool that links cost to schedules ascorrelated by the MOD Work Breakdown Structure (WBS).  The Operating Plan Revision Form (OPRF) is a module within Athena that documents proposedbaseline changes or modification to technical (including DA level process, plans, anddocumentation), schedule, risk, or budget items.  It is also the mechanism used tomaintain configuration management of a change process within a control board.  An OPRF isthe initial request form that identifies the type of change required (i.e., general,technical/risk, and schedule. On occasion, there will be OPRFs that will have multipleimpacts, and will be identified as such on the OPRF form.  When approved, the OPRF is theauthority for implementing the change and release of associated documentation. Question 9: What tool(s) are being used now for IT resource management at the MOD now? Are the Government furnished or contractor owned?Answer 9: The Mission Operations Directorate (MOD) uses the government furnished NASAHeadquarters IT Planning ProSight database.  This database is an Agency-wide web-basedapplication established to maintain capital planning and investment control (CPIC) forNASA.  The JSC CPIC process implements multiple Federal and NASA IT management andreporting requirements.  It establishes an end-to-end JSC IT planning and reportingprocess, with emphasis on integrating funding, planning, architecture, standards,security, procurement, and associated metrics.Question 10:  Does the subject procurement contains any additional requirements thanthose for the current PCCMS contract?Answer 10: No, the requirements for the MSC contract are unchanged from the PCCMScontract.Question 11:  Is there a Statement of Work (SOW) that can be posted?Answer 11: Yes, we will post a draft SOW.Question 12: Can you post an organizational chart of MOD and identify where the supportis provided by organization?Answer 12: See MSC web page for MOD organizational chart.Question 13: Can you provide an estimated value of the 60 month contract?Answer 13: The current total estimated cost plus fixed fee for the PCCMS contract is$4.1M for the performance period November 25, 2008 through November 31, 2012.

<DESC>THIS PROJECT WILL BE FUNDED BY THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF 2009. This pre-solicitation notice is hereby issued in accordance with the requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 5.704.
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 emphasizes the need for the United States to move toward electronic health records. The legislation requires the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), in part, to establish a Health Information Technology Testing Infrastructure (HITTI) that supports effective industry consensus standards development processes and provides the United States healthcare information technology (HIT) industry and federal activities with robust conformance and interoperability testing capabilities.</p>
<p>NIST is responsible for leading the development of the core HITTI that will provide a scalable, multi-partner, automated, remote capability for current and future testing needs. Initial emphasis will be on testing the standards addressing high national healthcare priorities (e.g., as identified and/or defined in concept of Electronic Health Record (EHR) technology "meaningful use"). NIST will work with standards and specification development organizations and other stakeholders to ensure appropriate feedback mechanisms exist for updating the standards.</p>
<p>The objective of the HITTI Project is to harmonize the efforts of healthcare standards test development and delivery to meet the demands for conformance and interoperability within the healthcare domain. This will be accomplished by working in collaboration with health IT stakeholders such as vendors, implementers, standards organizations, and certification bodies to establish a testing infrastructure that will:<br />-Provide a variety of conformance and interoperability testing services;<br />-Support a broad range of test environments;<br />-Support numerous health data exchange standards;<br />-Provide a component-based user interface;<br />-Enable user customization;<br />-Support changing user requirements; and<br />-Provide a feedback loop to enhance the health standards.</p>
<p>The following items are not within scope and shall not be considered part of the HITTI:<br />-Developing standards; <br />-Performing certifications;<br />-Conducting operational testing.<br /><br />The NAICS code for this requirement is 541511 with a small business size standard of $25.0 million. Contracting by Negotiation shall be utilized under the authority of FAR Part 15. This requirement is 100% set-aside for small business. A time and materials contract is anticipated.</p>
<p>The competitive Request for Proposal (RFP), amendments, and all questions and answers related to this procurement shall be made available via the Internet at HTTP://WWW.FEDBIZOPPS.GOV under RFP number SB1341-11-RP-0039.</p>
<p>Potential offerors shall be responsible for obtaining this solicitation and related Amendments, if any, from www.fbo.gov after the solicitation has been posted. It is, and will continue to be, the responsibility of each potential Offeror to monitor www.fbo.gov for any amendments or other information related to the solicitation. The Government will not maintain a mailing list.</p>
<p>Any communication regarding this requirement must be made in writing and forwarded via email to carol.wood@nist.gov, and shall identify the solicitation number, company name, company address, as well as point of contact email address and phone number.</p>
<p>Offerors shall be actively registered in the Central Contractor Registration website at www.ccr.gov, in order to be eligible to receive a contract under this solicitation.</p>
<p>NIST anticipates posting the solicitation on or about May 14, 2011.</p>

<p>The Mission requires a secure environment to conduct their mission. The Contractor shall provide the organizational structure, management, and qualified staff at levels adequate to meet or exceed the requirement contained in this Performance Work Statement (PWS). The Contractor shall be required to provide services in a manner that prevent loss or injury to U.S. personnel, dependents, property; destruction of assets and&nbsp;to prevent unauthorized access; and deter potential terrorist attacks.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of State intends to award a time and materials contract, with firm-fixed price and cost reimbursable elements, for local guard services, on behalf of the U.S. Mission Liberia. The Government will solicit this requirement as a full and open competition using acquisition procedures outlined in FAR Part 15. The Government plans to award one contract as a result of this acquisition. Anticipated period of performance is one base year and four one-year options, which shall be exercised at the sole discretion of the Government. <br /><br />All contracted personnel, regardless of nationality, will be required to pass a background investigation conducted by the Contractor and a separate background investigation conducted by the U.S. Government to certify their suitability to work under this contract. The Project Manager must possess a Level 3 language proficiency, which requires an ability to speak English with sufficient structural accuracy and vocabulary to participate effectively in most formal and informal conversations on practical, social, and professional topics.</p>
<p>The approximate acquisition schedule is as follows: the synopsis will be posted for approximately fifteen (15) days. On or about February 1, 2012, the Government plans to post the solicitation. No paper copies will be mailed. Once the solicitation is posted on FedBizOpps, the offerors will have approximately sixty (60) days to submit proposals. A contract is expected to be awarded within&nbsp;ninety (90)&nbsp;days of proposal submission. All dates are subject to change.</p>
<p>A site visit is tentatively scheduled&nbsp;on February 23, 2012 at the New Embassy Compound. Any changes to this date will be posted on this site. All interested parties must register in order to be granted access to the U.S. Mission Liberia.</p>
<p>The Question and Answer (Q&amp;A) period opens with the posting of the synopsis and end twenty-one (21) calendar days before proposals are due. Offerors may inquire about security risks by specific countries during this period. The solicitation, when finalized, will be available on the Internet at www.fedbizopps.gov.</p>

Offerors are requested to provide notice of their interest in the solicitation (i.e., name of representative, name of firm, address) to Amanda Rogers at RogersAN@state.gov. PHONE CALLS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.</p>

All prospective offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in order to be eligible for award. In accordance with 22 U.S.C. &sect; 4864, the Government will give preference to offerors qualifying as U.S. persons or U.S. Joint Venture Persons.

The availability of programmed funds will determine which alternative will be chosen. An option will be included to secure movable kitchen equipment. <br>Magnitude of construction is between $25,000,000.00 and $100,000,000.00.

<p>&nbsp;This solicitation is issued pursuant to FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. The Coast Guard intends to award a fixed price contract resulting from this solicitation. The Government shall award a contract resulting from this solicitation to a responsive, responsible bidder whose written quote is considered most advantageous to the Government, both in price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers proposals and are in descending order of importance: 1) Past Performance and 2) Price. Factors 1 and 2 will be applied to determine the best value to the Government. Past Performance shall be considered significantly more important than price (factor 2).<br />In accordance with FAR 19.1305, if your firm is HUBZone certified or FAR 19.1404, if your firm is a SDVOSB and intends to submit an offer for this acquisition, please respond by email to Karen Marshall at karen.m.marshall@uscg.mil or Fax at 757-628-4934. Questions may also be referred to Karen Marshall at this email address and by phone at (757) 628-4934. In response, please include the following: (a) positive statement of your intent to submit a bid for this solicitation as a prime contractor; (b) evidence of experience in work similar in type and scope to include contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts, points of contact and telephone numbers; (c) past performance references with points of contact and phone numbers. At least two (2) references are requested, but more are desirable. If two companies are planning to conduct business as a Joint Venture or any other type of teaming agreement they shall provide past performance on projects of similar scope that they have performed together as a Joint Venture. Providing individual past performance documentation from each company on separate projects where the two did not work together is not considered to be sufficient past performance. A Joint Venture that cannot provide this requested information will not be considered to have sufficient documentation needed to evaluate past performance as an evaluation factor. Contractors are reminded that should this acquisition become a HUBZone set-aside or SDVOSB set-aside, FAR 52.219-3, Notice of Total HUBZone Set Aside or 52.219-27 or Notice of Total Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Set-Aside will apply, which requires that at least fifty (50) percent of the cost of personnel for contract performance be spent for employees of the concern or employees of other HUBZone small business concerns.<br />Interested parties must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) as prescribed in FAR Clause 52.232-33. CCR can be obtained by accessing the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423. Your response is required by 4:30 p.m. EST February 6, 2012. All of the above must be submitted in sufficient detail for a decision to be made on a HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business set-aside. Failure to submit all information requested may result in a small business set-aside. A decision on whether this will be pursued as a HUBZone or SDVOSB set aside will be posted on the FBO website at https://www.fbo.gov/.</p>

There is no cost to register, review procurement data or make a bid on www.FedBid.com.Sellers that are not currently registered to use www.FedBid.com should proceed to www.FedBid.com to complete their free registration.

Sellers may not artificially manipulate the price of a transaction on www.FedBid.com by any means. It is unacceptable to place bad faith bids, to use decoys in the www.FedBid.com process or to collude with the intent or effect of hampering the competitive www.FedBid.com process.Should Sellers require additional clarification, contact FedBid at 877-9FEDBID (877-933-3243) or clientservices@fedbid.com.<BR><BR>Use of FedBid:   Buyers and Sellers agree to conduct this transaction through FedBid in compliance with the FedBid Terms of Use.

<DESC>The hydrant fueling system on their installation consists of a total of 18 fueling pits and 3 isolation pits.  Of these 21 hydrant pits lids, 14 of them are balanced using torsion springs vice counter-balance weights.  These pits were installed with the expansion of the aircraft parking apron in 1994.  The counter-balance springs are original to the construction.  Fourteen (14) of the spring balanced lids have broken or weak spring assemblies.  Without properly functioning spring assemblies, the lids are too heavy for a single person to open.  A backhoe or bobcat is required to safely open the lids.  This leads to mission degradation and increased time refueling aircraft.  In addition, lid seals on 16 of the pits have been compromised and allow water to infiltrate.  These seals must be replaced.
