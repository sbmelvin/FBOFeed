<DESC>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS.  The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) anticipates issuance of a sole source, cost plus fixed fee contract to Southwest Research Institute (SwRI), 6220 Culebra Road, San Antonio, TX, 78238-5166 for the Chemical, Biological Testing, Diagnostic Development, and Verification Services in Support of DTRA Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Defeat Program.  Under this effort, SwRI will provide specific engineering and technical services to test the innovative weapons technology being developed by and for DTRA, analyze the results of those tests against simulated biological and chemical agents in contractor provided facilities, and develop/verify new and innovative diagnostic techniques and procedures for testing these weapons.  SwRI will provide support for technology development, validation, test, evaluation, and studies related to biological and chemical Agent Defeat, Deny, and Disrupt (AD3) missions of DTRAs Counter Weapons Directorate.  SwRI will provide research and development services in two specific areas:  (1) Testing of innovative WMD Defeat technologies and analyze them for application to the Agent Defeat problem and (2) Development and verification of new and innovative diagnostic techniques and procedures for testing Chemical Biological counterforce WMD Defeat weapons.  This proposed contract is based on market research and is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The effort will require facilities certified and acceptable for large volumes of test in support of DTRAs AD3 Programs live simulant sub-scale testing (1/4 scale explosive force).  The facilities must be capable of testing in terms of: (1) the amount of explosive that can be used in single test and (2) live simulant instrumentation, plume containment and handling.  Additionally, the facility must be Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) certified and approved for Chemical and Biological sub-scale live simulant Agent Defeat weapon testing.  Support services for technology development, validation, test evaluations, and studies related to biological and chemical agent AD3 missions for DTRAs Counter Weapons Program must also be provided.  SwRI is the only responsible source capable of supporting the aforementioned requirements.  This announcement in no way commits the Government to make a contract award and does not authorize the contractor to incur pre-contract costs.  Under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, the support and services needed by the agency are available from only one responsible source and no other type of property or services will satisfy the needs of the agency.  A determination not to compete this proposed contract is based on market research and is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<a href="mailto:tamara.miles@emcbc.doe.gov">Tamara L Miles, Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>The United States Department of Energy (DOE) intends to extend thecurrentmanagement and operating (M&O) contract with Washington TRU Solutions(WTS),LLC, at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) to safely and economicallymaintain, operate and monitor the site and engage in the regulatoryrequiredpermitting process for the renewal of the sites complex, one-of-a-kindHazardous Waste Facility (HWF) permit.  The proposed contract extensionwillcover a two-year period from Sep 30, 2010 through Sep 30, 2012.  WIPPoperatespursuant to the terms and conditions of its HWF operating permit issued andenforced by the State of New Mexico Environment Department (NMED).  WTS andDOEare the Permittees under the permit.  Operations at WIPP are critical totheDOE mission as numerous sites across the DOE Complex ship defensetransuranic(TRU) wastes to this facility.  The proposed extension is required to allowtheregulatory-mandated permitting process to continue uninterrupted betweenthePermittees and NMED and to complete a competitive acquisition based upontheterms and conditions of the new permit.  The proposed extension isnecessary toensure the successful and timely issuance of the new HWF permit, allowingthecontinuation of operations at WIPP.Consistent with the services required by the contract, the servicesrequiredfor the proposed extension period are the same with the addition of thenegotiation of a new HWF permit.  These services include, but are notlimitedto, the following: Work associated with receipt and licensed disposal of TRU wasteso Waste Characterization and certification of TRU waste at various EM siteso Transportation Support (handling transporting vehicles/railcars)o Disposal of TRU wastes (soil and debris) in accordance with unique HWFPermito Release of Vehicles (cleaning/decontamination of vehicles/railcars)o Reporting Requirements Waste acceptance/disposal documents (receiving and acceptance) Reports (summary of volumes disposed of, audits, and license)o Interaction with Stakeholders HWF Permit Requirements (participate in the permitting process for theuniquely complex HWF permit)o Capabilities include: Extensive knowledge and experience with deep geologic repositories undertheResource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) as well as the uniquepermittingrequirements applicable to WIPP; Extensive knowledge, experience and history of WIPP operations or similaroperations to disposal in deep geologic repositories; Extensive experience with and knowledge of the regulatory environment inNewMexico; Ability to effectively implement and actively engage in the permittingprocess successfully, including, but not limited to, the following actions:reviewing NMED Completeness Determination or Hearing Determinationregardingpermit application, reviewing and resolving/responding to potentialNotice(s)of Deficiency throughout the 360 day technical review period,reviewing/responding to draft permit terms and conditions, entering intonegotiations with NMED during 360 day review period, reviewing/respondingtopublic comments as appropriate, attending and testifying at publichearing(s)as expert witnesses,  preparing the proposed findings of fact andconclusionsof law, and present closing arguments, and continuing to effectively andefficiently partner with DOE to establish an effective working relationshipwith NMED, including frequent communications, to ensure timelyidentificationand resolution of technical and regulatory issues, and the establishment ofpermitting schedule(s). Ability to accomplish the foregoing without disruption or cessation totheprogram as the above permitting process actions must occur whilesimultaneouslyand immediately performing operational activities at WIPP.A copy of the current contract Statement of Work is attached forinformation.Please note it does not include the negotiation of a new HWF permit whichis arequirement of the extension period and described above.The proposed contract action is for services for which the Governmentintendsto solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302.The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition isSection 303(c) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of1949,as amended by the Competition in Contracting Act (41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1)),implemented under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a) whichauthorizes other than full and open competition when the supplies orservicesrequired by the agency are available from only one responsible source, andnoother type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Thepresent contract with WTS is due to expire on               September 30,2010. The proposed contract extension will only include the services needed to:(1)safely and economically maintain, operate and monitor the WIPP site in astatethat assures the protection of the workers, the public, and the environmentwhile simultaneously; (2) ensure the permitting process for the renewal ofthesites complex, unique HWF permit is handled effectively and expeditiouslyandresults in the issuance of a new HWF permit; and (3) comply with allapplicablelaws, regulations and DOE policy.DOE believes the proposed two-year contract extension will provide thecurrentPermittees sufficient time to complete, at a minimum, the most criticalportions (negotiation of the permit terms and conditions and participationinthe public hearings) of the permitting process.  During the proposedextensionperiod, DOE will also engage in activities necessary to complete acompetitiveacquisition for the operation of WIPP.  This includes the definition ofDOEsrequirements as affected by the permitting process, the issuance of asolicitation accurately reflecting the requirements, and the award of afollow-on WIPP operating contract.THIS IS NOT A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS UNDER FAR PART 12, 15, OR ANINVITATION FOR BIDS UNDER FAR PART 14.  IF PARTIES CHOOSE TO RESPOND, ANYCOSTASSOCIATED WITH THE PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF DATA OR ANY OTHER COSTSINCURRED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT ARE THE SOLE RESPONSIBILITY OFTHERESPONDENT AND WILL NOT BE REIMBURSED BY THE GOVERNMENT.  Interestedpartiesbelieving they have all of the capabilities may submit capabilitystatements toprovide all of the services, including a demonstration of the ability tomeetall of the needs identified above within the required timeframes.

<DESC>This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice.  This is not a request for technical or cost proposals.  No solicitation is available at this time and requests for solicitation packages will not receive a response.
The National Institute on Deafness and Other Communicable Disorders (NIDCD), National Institutes of Health (NIH), has a requirement to maintain and further develop the NIDCD National Temporal Bone, Hearing and Balance Pathology Resource Registry (the Registry) that serves as a national resource for both the public and the biomedical research communities to promote research in the pathology underlying diseases and disorders of hearing and balance.  The Registry serves the biomedical research community by establishing and maintaining a catalog of currently active and inactive human temporal bone and brain tissue collections and by conserving temporal bone and brain collections by brokering the transfer of tissue specimens from inactive collections to active research centers.  It enables investigators to identify and locate all available processed temporal bones and related brain tissue specimens held in the United States by clinical and histopathologic diagnoses and other pertinent data so that further studies may be pursued.  The Registry also provides information and outreach services to the public and to health care practitioners on the acquisition of temporal bone and related brain tissues for research purposes.  Additional contract activities will continue to encourage the pursuit of research on the diseases and disorders of hearing and balance, particularly research utilizing the techniques of molecular biology and genetics and cellular biology by; 1) disseminating pertinent information to the auditory and vestibular research communities; 2) developing and fostering a program of professional education on pathology of the auditory and vestibular systems; and 3) encouraging investigator collaborations in the study of the human temporal bone and the related brain structures of hearing and balance.
Technical Specifications:	Operating system:  Microsoft Windows XP Professional	Database:	       Microsoft Access
A five year, cost reimbursement type contract is anticipated with an award made on or about March 1, 2009.  The solicitation will be issued on or about February 11, 2009 in an electronic format only, on this web site (https://www.fbo.gov).

This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1 (b)(1). 

The North American Industry Classification System code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  

The BioTek EL406 Microplate Washer and Dispenser are dedicated to high-throughput washing and dispensing of liquid in a multi- well format. This equipment will enable the execution of genome-wide RNAi screens and limited small compound screens which has not been possible at NCI before. The proposed instrumentation will enable high-throughput processing of cells in 96- and 384 well format for high-throughput imaging assays. The aforementioned experiments are currently impossible within the NCI because the current instruments are not automated to process thousands of samples, and instead require human intervention.

The equipment will be used in the high-throughput imaging (HTI) section of the CCR Fluorescence Imaging Facility in the Laboratory of Receptor Biology and Gene Expression (LRBGE). The facility is available to all CCR investigators who require advanced light microscopy instrumentation and expert guidance in using it. The investigators now using this facility have a demonstrated need to perform high- throughput liquid handling in order to develop, optimize and carry out assay as part of their high-throughput imaging screens. These studies require dispensing, aspiration and pipetting of several thousand samples per experiment. No instrumentation with this capability is currently available within the LRBGE or the CCR.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), plans to procure on a sole source the brand name AKTA Automated Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography System (FPLC) from GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp; 800 Centennial Avenue; P.O. Box 1327; Piscataway, NJ 08855-1327, USA.

This acquisition will be conducted under the procedures for acquiring commercial items authorized in FAR Part 12 and under the authority to use simplified procedures for commercial requirements as provided in FAR 13.501.

The North American Industry Classification System code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  

Research in NCI laboratory is aimed at understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer and developing anti-cancer antibody therapies. The NCIs efforts focus on building new therapeutic antibodies directed at ovarian cancer, mesothelioma and liver cancer. The NCI recently isolated novel human monoclonal antibody variable fragments specific for a therapeutic target on ovarian cancer and mesothelioma cells. It is now possible to make whole therapeutic human antibodies to treat cancer. In another ongoing project, the NCI plans to make new monoclonal antibodies directed to a new liver cancer antigen. The NCI needs to purify high quality and a large amount of the antigen and use it as an immunogen to immunize mice or screen our human antibody libraries. 

The results of such studies, as mentioned above, are expected to yield new information regarding ways to diagnose, interrupt, prevent and otherwise treat the spread of cancer. 

The salient characteristics of the AKTA Automated Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography System (FPLC) are:

	Fully automatic system: a computer running UNICORN software controls the separation unit and fraction collector. System automatically shuts down when pressure exceeds the limit.
	One working platform for all liquid chromatography techniques suitable for protein purification, from micro-gram to gram scale.
	User friendly software. The instrument can either be controlled manually or using programmed runs.
	Dual-pump system: Pump P-920 with a pressure sensor connected to pump module A and B.
	The chemical resistance of the pump makes it possible to use with corrosive liquids, such as organic solvents, as well as with high salt aqueous solutions. A full list of chemical resistance guide and chemical compatibility is available.
	Flow rates up to 20ml/min and pressures up to 5 MPa.
	Mixer M-925: all eluents can be mixed with a high degree of accuracy an reproducibility.
	Default methods for columns supplied by GE Healthcare are available with the UNICORN software. Customised methods can be created based on the method templates.
	Online UV and conductivity flow cells. Eluting peaks can be easily monitored.
	Frac-950 fraction collector (up to 120 fractions).
Benefit:
The results of such studies, as mentioned above, are expected to yield new information regarding ways to diagnose, interrupt, prevent and otherwise treat the spread of cancer. It is anticipated that a new antibody therapy will be developed which will be used in patients. These are expected to permit the filing of intellectual property claims based upon research performed with this instrument.

<RESPDATE>020509
<CONTACT>Karri L. Mares, Contract Specialist, Phone 3014357774, Fax 301-402-4513, Email maresk@mail.nih.gov
<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), plans to enter into a sole source procurement for 300 vials of Geltrex RGF BME with out Phenol Red 5 ML with Invitrogen Corporation; 3175 Staley Road; Grand Island, NY 14072-2090. 

The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 325414 and the business size standard is 500 employees. 

The purpose of this purchase is to maintain uniformity in the NCIs research in Angiogenesis. Angiogenesis is fundamentally important in tissue development, vascular disease, and cancer progression.  The availability of high-throughput, simple assays for the study of multiple-cell biological processes, such as Angiogenesis, is essential for the development of therapeutics and diagnostics for disorders governed by these complex processes.

This is a pretested biological product. To maintain uniformity in the NCIs research in Angiogenesis it is necessary to purchase reliable pretested products. One of the most import features of this gel is that it must give minimal induction of angiogenesis when unsupplemented with exogenous growth factors (ie addition of 5% fetal bovine serum or 20ng/ml vascular endothelial cell growth factor, VEGF). ).  The greater the angiogenic response elicited by the unsupplemented gel is, the less sensitive the final quantitative assay will be (the large the change [delta] between supplemented and unsupplimented gel is, the more sensitive a given angiogenesis assay becomes using this gel).   Hence it becomes imperative to evaluate a large selection of commercially available gel preparations to determine which one is best suited for the highest sensitivity angiogenesis assay.  The Angio Core routinely evaluates ten or more individual gel preparations (different lots) from several outside vendors and chooses one for bulk purchase based on the sensitivity data generated.  This gel preparation then serves as an Angio Core standard for running the angiogenesis assays sited above and is distributed as a reference standard to the intramural/extramural communities.The NCI has tested similar products from other vendors and found that this particular lot produced by Invitrogen Corporation meets the standards and requirements to properly perform the research required.  

The commercially available product that gives the least endothelial cell response in the unsupplemented conditions throughout these analyses is chosen as the candidate gel for bulk purchase.  Hence the most important feature a test support matrix should have to qualify as a gel candidate for bulk purchase is the complete lack of eliciting an endothelial cell response for any given assay screened. All commercial products were compared to the existing gel matrix used as the Angio Core standard and the candidate that was equal to or exceeded this standards endothelial response profile was chosen as the next generation standard.  The Invitrogen product (Lot537681) satisfied this critical restriction demand.

This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the requirement as detailed they may submit a statement of capabilities. All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient details to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the contracting office on or before  11:00 am ET , on February 5, 2009.  All questions must be in writing and must be emailed to Karri Mares maresk@mail.nih.gov faxed to (301) 402-4513.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD), China Lake, CA intends to modify contract N68936-05-C-0068 on an other than full and open competition basis to provide additional hours and the associated cost and fee in support of the System Configuration Sets (SCS) requirement.  SCS support is required to continually upgrade the AV-8B aircraft weapons system for the United States Marine Corps (USMC), Spanish Navy, Italian Navy, United Kingdom Royal Air Force, and other Foreign Countries through a series of spiral SCS developments.  This procurement is a sole source to McDonnell Douglas Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of The Boeing Company, P.O. Box 516, St. Louis, MO 63166.  As the sole developer and manufacturer of the aircraft, Boeing performed the engineering design and software development for the tactical software and integration of the avionics into the aircraft weapon system and all associated aircraft weapons system upgrades.  As system war fighting capability is enhanced through the addition of new sensors and weapons, integration becomes increasingly complex.  The increased complexity requires Boeing's experienced resources.  Only Boeing can insure compatibility between software ! and aircraft systems due to on-going changes, upgrades, and system enhancements that are made to fleet aircraft.  The services shall be performed at the contractor facility in St. Louis, MO and on-site at the NAVAIRWARCENWPNSDIV China Lake, CA. The modification will increase the Level-of-Effort by approximately 76,000 hours.  The contract SOW and end date of 17 October 2010 will not change.  Award will be made on or about 23 March 2009.  Any firms believing that they can provide the required services must submit a written response in accordance with note 22 clearly showing their ability to perform the work without compromising the quality, accuracy, reliability, and delivery of the product to the fleet. Responses shall be submitted to Gary Trimble at the address noted above by 12 March 2009.See Note 22 and 26.

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command intends to issue solicitation N00024-09-R-2204 for the accomplishment of Fitting Out Availability (FOA) for LPD 21 (NEW YORK) with an option for the accomplishment of Post Shakedown Availability (PSA) for LPD 21 (NEW YORK).  This solicitation shall also contain options for the accomplishment of FOA and PSA for LPD 25 (SOMERSET).  There will be no drydockings for any of these availabilities.  For LPD 21, efforts will include an 8 week FOA in FY10 to complete system installations and capabilities that were not part of the basic construction and that are necessary to support ship Post Delivery Test & Trials (PDT&T).  A PSA of up to 14 weeks for LPD 21 will follow in FY10.  For LPD 25, efforts will include an 8 week FOA in FY12, followed by a PSA of up to 14 weeks also planned in FY12.  FOA/PSA efforts include all manpower, support services, material, and associated technical data and documents required to prepare for and accomplish these avai! labilities.  The work to be accomplished will include correction of Government responsible deficiencies, installation of approved engineering changes (that were not incorporated during the construction period) and new work identified between ship delivery and the start of FOA/PSA.  Efforts will include engineering and management support of FOA/PSAs, testing and post repair sea trials, and other emergent work.  The proposed contract will include scope to allow for emergent availabilities to correct Government responsible deficiencies identified after delivery that must be corrected to support test & trials prior to the start of the FOA/PSA.  During FOA/PSA, the ships will be made available for completion of Fleet funded repairs and changes.  Work on these two vessels will take place in the homeport area of Norfolk, Virginia.  Third party access must be granted for the purposes of allowing work to be performed by Government Alteration Installation Team (AIT) and allowing the ! building yard to complete unfinished and warranty work.  A responsible offer will be considered eligible if the offeror has previously executed a master agreement for repairs and alterations of vessels or is a ship repair firm that can demonstrate those qualifications.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<p><br />The following paragraphs, IAW FAR Part 13.501, are provided to support the brand name justification for proposed orders exceeding the micro-purchase threshold, but not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.</p>
<p>The OUSD(AT&amp;L) office requires the purchase of Active Navigation Software Maintenance and Support neccesary to provide continued support for the Active Navigation Search Engine currently implemented in the AT&amp;L environment. The Active Navigation Search Engine is uniquely suited to fulfill the requirement for standing up an enterprise search engine capability for the AT&amp;L. OUSD(AT&amp;L)/ARA/ITM had completed an evaluation of software products to provide a virtual library and search capability to deliver an enterprise wide capability to be implemented throughout AT&amp;L. The search engine chosen for this initiative was Active Navigation. The DAMIR initiative fully integrated the search engine into their system, allowing AT&amp;L technical personnel to gain valuable knowledge and expertise in the installation, customization and operation of the search engine. As a result of the great success of the Active Navigation product with the DAMIR initiative, AT&amp;L decided to establish an enterprise search engine capability, consolidating 3 legacy search capabilities. The maintenance and support is necessary to provide AT&amp;L with continued support for this initiative. This software is currently in use at the requiring office and to use another solution the competition's base software would need to be added. This would lead to a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. In order to preserve continuity of the software, and avoid a duplication of the cost, the Active Navigation Software must be used.</p>

<DESC>U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division has a requirement for Expeditionary TRICON Systems (ETS).  Offerors may bid on one or all of the systems.  Contract award(s) to one or more contractors are possible.

Force Provider modules returning from theater for RESET (renovation) are incorporating these expeditionary systems.  The Army Acquisition Objective is currently 56 Modules.  52 modules have been built to date.  Twelve modules are scheduled to return from theater in the next year.  The quantity of systems (per type) that could be ordered under this contract range from 4 to over 120.  The ETS concept consists of the following:  an Expeditionary TRICON Latrine System (ELS), Expeditionary TRICON Shower System (ESS), Expeditionary TRICON Kitchen System (EKS), and Expeditionary TRICON Batch Laundry System (EBL); all of which are part of a continuing effort to provide improved combat field service equipment for the expeditionary War Fighter.  The Product Manger, Force Sustainment Systems Combat Field Service Equipment Team (PM FSS CFSET) developed the concept of the TRICON-based support systems.  This concept is based on the existing ISO (20-foot) containerized support systems currently in use by the joint services and managed by PM FSS.  The new design, based on the expandable ISO TRICON (8 x 6.5 x 8) platform will provide more flexibility and capability for the expeditionary War Fighter in a smaller and more easily deployed unit, fully transportable by sea, air, or land.  Prototype and limited production ETS assets have been designed, fabricated and successfully field-tested and deployed, and are available to view at the U.S. Army Soldier Systems Center.  The systems sought via this contract effort shall be built-to-print based on existing technical data packages.  All systems shall incorporate an integral water supply and waste water storage and be capable of discharging waste water up to 50-feet away at sufficient capacities to keep up with maximum discharge of each system; incorporate an onboard pump system of sufficient capacity for delivery of hot and cold water for all related operations and be environmentally controlled.  Power for these systems shall be supplied from a military standard generator (60 kW, 208 Volt, 3 Phase 50/60 Hz).  All system components shall be packed within the system for transport, including the equipment per the supplied systems packaging plan. Total packed weight of each individual system, with all components, shall not exceed 9500 lbs. The ELS shall support an expeditionary base camp size of 150 personnel by incorporating four (4) toilets, two (2) sinks and two (2) urinal troughs, divided into two (2) separate compartments and operate off of one 60A power input. The ESS shall provide a shower capability for an expeditionary base camp size of 150 personnel by incorporating four (4) shower stalls with user adjusted shower water spray temperature and four (4) personal hygiene sinks, divided into two (2) separate compartments, and operate off of one (1) 100A power input and one (1) 60A power input.  Target temperature at each shower head is 105 deg. F.  The EKS shall provide food serving and kitchen sanitation capability for an expeditionary base camp size of 150+ personnel by incorporating major components as follows:  one (1) cook and hold oven, one (1) half-oven, one (1) steamer, one (1) tilting steam jacketed kettle, one (1) griddle, one (1) counter-style refrigerator, three (3) serving/preparation tables, and one (1) three well sanitation system.  The hot water supply flow for general use shall be maintained between 110 F and 120 F.  The sanitation well of the sink shall have a separate water heater to maintain the sanitation water temperature at 180 F.  The EKS shall operate off of two (2)100A power inputs. The EBL shall provide laundry capability for an expeditionary base camp size of 150 personnel and, as such, shall incorporate one (1) 50-lb capacity washer and one (1) 75-lb capacity electric dryer.  The EBL shall operate off one (1) 100A POWER INPUT and one (1) 60A power input.  System fabrication, assembly and integration shall conform to best commercial practices and applicable standards from NFPA, NSF, ANSI, ASME, ASSE, and IAPMO.  Materials and coatings shall be selected to provide effective resistance to wear, rust, decay, and deterioration.  Construction shall be such that the equipment is capable of withstanding extremely hard usage encountered in Military Service.  Examples of hard usage are as follows:  Cross country transportation, material handling onto transport vehicles, storage in harsh environments (salt air, UV, temperature and weather), operation in extreme temperature and humidity, and high altitude.  Some systems may be required to survive exposure to chemical contamination.  The contract effort(s) shall include development of technical manuals and other data associated with the logistical support of each system. This acquisition is subject to the Berry Amendment (see Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS) 252.225-7012).  This acquisition will be a set aside for small business. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 332999.  The Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Code is 3491 and the Small Business Size Standard is 500 employees. The successful offeror(s) shall build, test, and manufacture the ETS in accordance with the Government furnished production drawings and associated lists, and the statement of work.  First production units shall undergo a contractor first article test (FAT).  The FAT shall consist of non-destructive testing to include a complete operational demonstration.  After Government approval and acceptance of the first production units and associated contract data, delivery orders may be issued for 1-500 production units of each system over a five-year duration.

<DESC>This Request for Information is for planning purposes only and is issued in accordance with FAR Clause 52.215-3.  No solicitation document exists at this time.  Issuance of this notice does not constitute any obligation on the part of the Government to procure these services or to issue a solicitation.  In addition, the Government is under no obligation to pay for information submitted in response to this RFI, and responses to this notice cannot be accepted as offers.  Any information that the vendor considers proprietary should be clearly marked as such.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to conduct market research which will be used to formulate an acquisition strategy to procure contract closeout services.  The Regional Contracting Office, Northeast (RCO-NE) is requesting responses from all qualified sources and is particularly interested in the general availability of small business vendors capable of providing contract closeout under GSA MOBIS 874, or NAICS 541611. 
RCO-NE has a sizeable number of contract files (approx. 3500-5000) dating back to the year 2000.  An initial inventory has found the files are predominantly commercial purchase and delivery orders, or simplified acquisitions, with less than 10% requiring complex closeout (i.e. audits). The inventory process will require physical removal of the files from RCO-NE, Building #2010, Marine Corps Combat Development Command (MCCDC), Quantico, VA to the vendor's facility with suitable controls and oversight.   Close-out procedures in accordance with FAR 4.804 and industry best practices are required.  RCO-NE staff is also interested in establishing process improvements identified through "Lessons Learned" and contractor best practices to apply to future contract close-out procedures. 
Responses to this RFI shall not exceed four (4) pages, including cover letter and contact information.  Subject response must contain: (1) Capability statement sufficient to demonstrate performance acumen directly related to contract closeout; (2) Notations of time to complete previous, similar efforts and a description of any quality processes applied; (3) Link to the respondent's GSA MOBIS Schedule, or attached file of same; and (4) Citation of any current, or past customers (i.e., within the past 2 years) to include contract number, point of contact telephone number or e-mail address.
Response is due by 4:00 p.m., February 2, 2009.   Only electronic responses will be considered.  Submit to Mrs. Wanda Cooper, wanda.cooper@usmc.mil.

ONEP Geographic Information System (GIS) Technical Assistance.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a technical assistance for ONEP Geographic Information System (GIS)

ONEP Geographic Information System (GIS) Technical Assistance
Founded in 1972, ONEP is the main producer of drinking water, producing 80% of the national production.  ONEP is a public company and is responsible for the countrys potable water supply, as well as for wastewater treatment and recycling.   Subsequently, ONEP is charged with the management of drinking water and wastewater networks as well as watershed protection zones.  

Until recently, ONEP has tended to manage the areas of urban water supply, rural water supply, and wastewater treatment as separate and unrelated areas.  As water/wastewater management becomes increasingly more important in Morocco, the need on ONEPs part for an integrated, enterprise-wide approach is becoming increasingly evident.  Effective water resource management requires an in-depth understanding of the location, timing and amount of water used, and GIS technology can provide an essential platform in which to analyze and display this type of information, to make better-informed decisions about management and allocation, and to improve long-range planning.

ONEPs core operations would substantially benefit from a new, GIS-supported, unified approach to its activities, particularly in the following areas:
Land usage as it applies to ONEP land (for example: land associated with treatment plants, ONEP pipeline rights-of-way) 
Water resources (technical and administrative data, quality, etc.)
Watershed protection zones (both physical and environmental aspects)
Drinking-water networks (production; rural drinking-water supply; urban distribution)
Wastewater networks (including drinking-water purification plants)
Commercial aspects (customer management, billing, etc.)

Full implementation of an integrated, enterprise-wide GIS solution would yield for ONEP better data processing and management, a reduced cost of data generation and utilization as well as improved decision making and communication.  The technologies are similar to those in widespread use throughout the international water industry, and such a system would modernize and integrate data management to improve ONEPs activities.  The implementation of modern GIS-based information for water management in Morocco is essential in order for ONEP to achieve its corporate objectives in a competitive 21st century environment.   

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $385,876 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to: https://www.ustda.gov/USTDA/FedBizOpps/RFP/rfpform.asp.  Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firms name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English and in French directly to the Grantee by 12:00 p.m. NOON, March 27, 2009 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE; PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: SOCIETE  NATIONALE  DELECTRICITE  -  SNEL DEPARTEMENT  DE  RECHERCHE  ET  DEVELOPPEMENT, 2381, Avenue de la Justice, B.P. 500 KINSHASA, GOMBE, RDC, Tele: +243 81 700 54 93.

Democratic Republic of Congo:  Nzilo II Hydropower Plant Feasibility Study.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a Feasibility Study for the Societe Nationale dElectricite (SNEL). 

Stability and economic growth in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is crucial to the development of sub-Saharan Africa in general.  The size of Western Europe, DRC is centrally located on the African Continent, and shares borders with nine countries.  Improvements in the power and transportation infrastructure sectors alone could facilitate transcontinental trade, and provide electricity for large portions of Southern, Central, and even West Africa.  Although DRC faces diverse challenges to developing its economy, the nation also represents vast commercial potential, and wields tremendous influence over the stability of the region.  The Feasibility Study would examine the potential for a 33-80 megawatt (MW) facility, in the Katanga Province, expected to cost between $112 - $250 million.     

Prior to an extended period of war in DRC, the mining sector was the backbone of the nations economy, accounting for 85 percent of export earnings.  Currently, as DRC attempts to reconstruct its economy, it is faced with significant power shortages around the nation and also in the important mining province of Katanga, where the Nzilo 2 site is located.  This Feasibility Study would help ensure that the mining industry has access to sufficient power for the continued development of mining operations and value-added beneficiation projects.  After initial feasibility is demonstrated, it is envisioned that the Nzilo 2 site would be developed by SNEL in partnership with a mining company located in the region, a model that is being successfully implemented for several other power projects in the region.

For many prospective power projects in the DRC, preliminary data either does not exist or was destroyed during the war.  While preliminary assessments for the Nzilo 2 site indicate the potential for implementation, they lack detailed technical data.  Accordingly, the Terms of Reference (TOR) for this activity include many aspects of what the power industry refers to as a pre-feasibility study. This involves technical assessments of the topographic, hydrological and geotechnical characteristics of the site, which are essential to determining hydroelectric potential.  

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $553,534 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

<DESC>Under Statutory Authority  41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), the VA Great Lakes Acquisition Center anticipates entering into sole source procurement negotiations with Olympus Surgical & Industrial America Inc., Orangeburg, NY for a Olympus EVIS EXERA II at the VA Medical Centers located in Iron Mountain, Michigan.The product provided by Olympus Surgical & Industrial America Inc is the only high-definition imaging system designed for application across medical and surgical endoscopy.  The flexibility of this system allows for intraoperative colonoscopy by allowing surgeons to switch between a laparoscope and colonoscope during advanced colorectal surgery to confirm an anastomosis.  The unique imaging system introduces for the first time a combination of 1080i HD image processing with Narrow Band ImagingTM technology to enhance visualization of mucosal surfaces.  EVIS EXERA II is also the only system that introduces a fully integrated HD system throughout the entire imaging chain, beginning with the HD EndoEYE videoscope, through the powerful HD processor, and onto the HD monitor, for a true HD image. Olympus is the only vendor to provide an aspect ratio of 5:4.  Everyone else is 16:9 which is cinema and results in a stretched image from side to side and top and bottom cutoff.  This results in distortion.  This system is the only system on the market that allows you to run GI scopes and OR scopes.  No other vendor can offer this.  This system provides a mirror image back-up as it is the exact same equipment that we run in our GI lab.  It also offers one piece HD EndoEye laparoscopes, the metal shaft has no rod lenses whereas standard laparoscopes have 15-17 glass lenses that can be easily  This is the only product with the ability to provide a surgical video endoscope system with the following required features:  "	CCD video chip in the distal end of the scope to eliminate the need for a camera head on the scopes."	Video processor that is compatible with both HD and non-HD video endoscopes and camera heads."	Camera head that is autoclavable."	Deflectable tip laparoscopic scopes with 10MM and 5MM."	High definition, distally mounted CCD video chip, autoclavable, 10MM laparoscopes "	Distally mounted CCD video chip, autoclavable, 5MM laparoscopes This announcement is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under FAR 6.302-1.  The above authority is cited and justification made based on the determination that the Government's minimum needs can best be satisfied by supplies available from one source.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Other persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement by 2 February 2009 at 1600hrs.  Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with all of the requirements.  All interest received on or before 2 February 2009 will be evaluated by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received as a result of the notice of intent will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>Under Statutory Authority  41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), the VA Great Lakes Acquisition Center anticipates entering into sole source procurement negotiations with Skytron., Grand Rapids, MI for Surgical Booms at the VA Medical Centers located in Iron Mountain, Michigan.The product provided by Skytron is the only contractor that provides the product that has the capability to be compatible with the existing equipment.  The surgical suites have limited space in the OR suites due to room size and ceiling height.  Any equipment that would require multiple hubs in the ceiling for mounting each individual equipment boom/arm would hinder the mobility of the equipment and surgical light positioning.  The central tandem mount is unique. It has the ability to mount up to 4 device arms on one ceiling hub. This design is critical in our OR suites due to room size and space limitations.  Skytron's "Central Tandem Mount" with up to 2 equipment booms and 2 light heads, provides shoulder to shoulder coverage of the patient in a 360? arc. It provides the clinical pathway for surgery global positioning around the surgical field. This enhances patient care in minimizing room set up and allowing surgeons and nurses access to the equipment regardless of surgical procedure or patient entry.  The Skytron Equipment Boom arms come in a variety of lengths that provide the reach in excess of other space management designs and provide set up flexibility for all types of specialties and clinical need requirements.  The Aurora LED Lights have several features unique in the design for surgical illumination. The key feature is the variable focus design. The Aurora light is the only variable focus light available in the world today. This allows the surgeon to provide pin point focus at any level within the wound cavity.  The VSRD cold mirror reflector technology provides a shadow free field for the surgeon as well. By splitting the LED beam, over 500 points of overlapping light patches in the field are created.   The Aurora LED Lights provides a design for suspension such that it provides for 360? of movement at every junction. Other designs have stops or arm conflicts that limit the range of motion or inhibit surgical light positioning as well as interfere with the equipment arms.  The Aurora Lights offer 2 color temperature settings.  Color correct temperature of 4,000K or 4,500K can be flexibly determined case by case, based upon each surgeon's individual needs and preferences. This announcement is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under FAR 6.302-1.  The above authority is cited and justification made based on the determination that the Government's minimum needs can best be satisfied by supplies available from one source.

<DESC><p>The 325th Contracting Squadron, Tyndall AFB FL, is in the process of determining the acquisition strategy for our Contracted Flight Training Service. This is a request for information (RFI) and not a formal solicitation. Any formal solicitation will be announced separately and at a later time. Information provided to the Government as a result of this posting is strictly voluntary and given with no expectation of compensation, and clearly provided at no cost to the Government. Contact with Government personnel, other than the Contracting Officer, by potential offeror's or their employees regarding this requirement is strictly prohibited. The contracting officer will endeavor to post all information regarding this solicitation as soon as it becomes available.</p>
<p><br />The Air Force is interested in determining if sufficient and qualified small businesses are available and interested in providing the contemplated service for the period of 1 Oct 2009 through 30 Sep 2010, with five (5) one-year options. The Air Force reserves the right to set-aside this entire acquisition for small business; however, we invite both large and small businesses to address the questions below. At this time, the Air Force is only interested in identifying interested and capable contractors for this service, as part of the market research effort. The purpose of posting this RFI is to locate capable businesses that are interested in performing a non-personal service contract that provides flight training services using contractor provided turboprop or high performance piston engine type aircraft at Tyndall AFB, FL. Training to be provided includes Battle Management Command and Control (BMC2) target training (both air-to-air and air-to-ground), live-fire training, weapons system evaluations, and MAJCOM directed development test and evaluations at Tyndall AFB, FL. The contractor shall be required to provide approximately 5,200 flight training hours annually. The aircraft must be equipped to carry government furnished telemetry relay equipment. Aircrew shall obtain and maintain specialized training and qualifications to fly the aircraft. Pilots shall have a current Commercial Pilot License with Instrument Privileges, at least a minimum of five-year experience in fighter, bomber or Close Air Support aircraft, USAF flight line operations, and BMC2 procedures. Additionally, Pilots shall hold a current Battle Management Instructor qualification and teach basic airmanship subjects to Undergraduate Air Battle Management (UABM) students both on the ground and during flights and pass an annual Battle Management Checkride conducted by the government. BMC2 air-to-air training includes conducting 2v2 and 2v3 targeting scenarios (tactical intercepts) and teaching UABM students targeting tactics, techniques, and procedures. BMC2 air-to-ground training includes conducting 2-ship Dynamic Targeting and Close Air Support and teaching UABM students proper tactics, techniques, and procedures. BMC2 academic and flying airmanship training includes teaching UABM students selected portions of aviation ground school with reinforcement training on aircraft flights.

Maintenance supervisor shall have the following certification: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Air Frame and Propulsion (A&amp;P) License and all other maintenance personnel shall be certified in accordance with the applicable FAA directives for their respective duties.</p>
<p><br />The total period of performance will be six years structured by a basic contract period and up to five (5) option years. We anticipate the contract type will be firm-fixed price, small business set-aside, under NAICS 611512 with the applicable small business size standard of $25.5 million in annual gross receipts. To support the set-aside decision, it is particularly important that potential small business concerns provide industry comments as follows: (1) If you are a Small Business that performs on contracts under NAICS 611512 and plans on participating in the competition of this acquisition, please provide information relative to past performance and/or experience similar to Contracted Flight Training contracts.

<DESC><p>I. Description
<p>The Air Armament Center Capabilities Integration Directorate Division AAC/XR is requesting information and/or concepts for developing an airborne capability to remotely mark vehicles for identification purposes. A near-term technology is sought for fast implementation; therefore, mature technologies are preferred. Respondent information will be used by the Government to determine the most promising approaches to standoff (line of sight) "tagging," how operational sensing and tracking of the tag marker could be accomplished, and the art of the possible in meeting further desired qualities described below. Responses to this RFI will be used by the Government to determine corporate interest in demonstrating such systems. From the responses to this RFI, the Air Force will determine the feasibility of hosting demonstrations at Eglin Air Force Base and developing an acquisition strategy.</p>
<p>Tagging technologies are sought which satisfy the following criteria:</p>
<p>1. Effectiveness: Tags should be readily applied to a variety of commercial or other vehicles, from a host aircraft at a distance of approx. 3 km or greater, and be easily recognized from similar distances. Commercial paint, trim, tires, upholstery, etc. can be assumed for the target vehicles.</p>
<p>2. Persistence: Tags should be capable of being sensed and tracked for at least a few hours duration, with a goal of a few days. Tags may be permanent or ephemeral.</p>
<p>3. Inconspicuous: An ideal tag will be unobservable to the unaided eye, but readily detected with a sensor. Visible tags that are not readily identifiable as intentionally marked will also be considered. In general, less obvious tags are better.</p>
<p>4. Unique ID: An ideal tag will allow the user to distinguish among multiple similar vehicles with tags, i.e. a different identifiable tag for each.</p>
<p>5. Date/Time: An ideal tag will include a time stamp or expiration feature which will allow some idea of the age of a tag under observation, to allow the observer to easily recognize and disregard an old tag which has outlived its usefulness. Alternatively, the tag may simply disappear over time.</p>
<p>6. Platform Compatibility: The tagging system must be compatible with carriage on relatively slow-moving (propeller-driven) aircraft or UAV's. Respondents should provide some estimate of the size and weight of proposed systems. Consideration should be given as to how the system would be integrated so that the air/flightworthiness and safety of the original airframe are not compromised.</p>
<p>7. Maturity: Any level of maturity will be considered; however, please indicate if the system is available within the next few months for a ground demonstration. Indicate when the technology would be available for military use.</p>
<p>Additionally, the following information is requested (if available) to enable the Government to better evaluate the maturity and effectiveness of the proposed tagging technology:</p>
<p>1. Military Utility: Any weaponization analysis/studies of the tagging technology and potential concepts of employment to show performance, effectiveness, and military utility.</p>
<p>2. Reliability/Maintainability: Any data on tagging technology reliability and maintainability issues and their potential solutions.</p>
<p><br />II. Government Information</p>
<p>THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR TO OTHERWISE PAY FOR THE INFORMATION SOLICITED. This RFI is for planning purposes only, and shall not be considered as a Request for Proposal (RFP), or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs of charges by the Government will arise due to contractor submission of responses to this RFI or the Government's use of such information.</p>

<p>This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only. It does not constitute a formal Request for Proposal (RFP), and should not be construed as such a commitment by the U.S. Government. All information contained in this RFI is preliminary, and subject to modification.</p>
<p>III. Responses</p>
<p>Responses should include information about all relevant and applicable unclassified technologies available within the aforementioned timeframes and based on requested criteria. They should include information about the type of material, hazard classification, physical properties, etc., as described in requirement criteria.</p>

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation, Lower Colorado Regional Office, Boulder City, Nevada, intends to award on a sole source basis a purchase order to Maritime Solutions, Inc., 17 Battery Place, Suite 913, New York, NY  10004, for two (2) mussel filtration systems.
The Government believes that only one responsible source can provide the parts that will satisfy the agency requirements.  A Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition has been prepared in support of this acquisition.  Firms believing they can provide required items must provide supporting evidence that they can furnish the parts identified above in sufficient detail to demonstrate the respondent's ability to meet the stated requirement.  
Sole Source Justification:  Filter ScreenThe primary filter screen must be made of stainless steel, weaved wire creating a square trap for retention of organic matter. The dimensions of the square must not exceed 100 microns/side (120 absolute). The screen has to be supported in such a manner as to achieve robust construction. A minimum of 4 layers, sintered together is required to prevent the filter screen from distortion or ripping.  A self-cleaning, coarse strainer in the inlet chamber is also required.  This screen will need to be 1/8 inch in size for larger debris filtration.   Sealing of the screen V shape hydraulic seals should be present in the filter to insure that there is no leakage of unfiltered water around the screen. O-ring seals are not acceptable as they tend to leak at high pressures.  2)  Screen Cleaning System, 100% of the screen should be cleaned during every cleaning cycle taking as little time as possible. The amount of water for the back wash cycle should be as low as possible. The filter should use no more then 3 % of the total flow rate for back wash.  3)  Manufacturing:  The filter should be manufactured to ISO 9000 standards at the minimum. Quality assurance should exist that each filter is checked and tested individually for pressure rating, leakage, mechanical operation and electrical operation before shipment. 4)  Monitoring Equipment & Apparatus-To adequately monitor the filter during operation the following instrumentation should be included as part of the filter package: Flow meter to measure total flow through the filter; Flow meter to measure the volume of backwash; A data recorder to store all information collected ; Remote control/alarm capability.
All responses received within eleven (11) days of the publication date of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Inquiries will only be accepted by FAX at (702) 293-8050, Attention:  Carmen Bernhardt.  Responses shall include the firm's DUNS (Dun and Bradstreet) number and federal tax identification number (TIN).  Firms shall also identify themselves as either a small business or other than small business, in accordance with the size standard for North American Industry Classification (NAICS) 333999, which is 500 employees.

<DESC>Concerns having the ability to furnish the services described herein are requested to give written notification (including the telephone number for a point of contact) to the procuring office above within 10 calendar days from the date of this synopsis.  The U.S. Geological Survey, Central Region Energy Team, Geologic Division, has a requirement to obtain a database with extensive worldwide coverage that contains organic geochemical data on oil and gas samples from exploratory wells and producing fields. The database must be in digital form with precise location information such that data can be plotted on maps using Geographic Information System (GIS) computer software. Access to such a database is critical to the identification and mapping of petroleum systems for the World Energy assessment project and for future National assessments. The PD must contain oil and gas data on at least 7000 oils and 2000 natural gases. The database is to be manipulated using Access and is displayed via the ArcView geographic information system (GIS). This database will be updated with new samples every six months.
Based on the information at this time, the government considers the services specified as a sole source from GeoMark Research Ltd, 9748 Whithorn Dr, Houston, TX 77095-5024, and proposes to negotiate a contract with the firm on that basis.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered.  Firms who feel that they can furnish the required services are invited to submit in writing an affirmative response to this announcement, and such other materials which correspond to the required items stated herein.  This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  Since no solicitation document exists, request for such documents without accompanying information will be considered non-responsive to this request without further consideration.

<DESC>The Pacific Region Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) Region 12 and the Southwest Region TRBO  Regions 9/10, two integrated  delivery networks, comprised of  Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in Hawaii, Guam, Okinawa, Japan, Korea, and California announce a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of One Step Surgical Prep, Applicator Sponge Device, Povidone-Iodine and Isopropyl Alcohol (PVP-I W/IPA)- [0.5% to 0.75% Povidone-Iodine and 60-75% Isopropyl Alcohol].<BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the regions based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price. It is also intended that standardized products be obtained through the Department of Defense (DoD) Prime Vendor (PV) Program.<BR>The major Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the Regions include but are not limited to Tripler Army Medical Center, U.S. Naval Hospital Okinawa, U.S. Naval Hospital Guam, U.S. Naval Hospital Yokosuka, 121st Combat Support Hospital Seoul, 374th Medical Group, Yokota AB, 18th Medical Group Kadena AB,  Naval Medical Center San Diego; David Grant Medical Center, Travis AFB, Naval Hospital Camp Pendleton, Robert E. Bush Hospital, Twenty-Nine Palms, Weed Army Community Hospital, Ft. Irwin, Naval Hospital Lemoore; 9th Medical Group, Beale AFB, 30th Medical Group, Vandenberg AFB,  61st Medical Squadron, Los Angeles AFB, and  95th Medical Group, Edwards AFB. <BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel. In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program. This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their products. This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil<BR>The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of two years (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods. Anticipated selection date is April 2009. The evaluation will be based on technical, clinical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price. As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important. The selection will be determined utilizing best value/ trade-off criteria. The selection of a single vendor is anticipated. However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the two Regions, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs. In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.     <BR>Points of Contact:<BR>Mary Summers, TRBO Technical Director<BR>808-433-3686, mary.summers1@us.army.mil<BR><BR>Cheryl Janus, RN, TRBO Clinical Analyst<BR>808-433-7985, cheryl.janus@amedd.army.mil<BR><BR>B.	Products & Performance Required.  <BR>The Pacific and Southwest Regions are seeking product line items in the category of One Step Surgical Prep, Applicator Sponge Device, Povidone-Iodine with Isopropyl Alcohol. <BR> [0.5% to 0.75% Povidone-Iodine and 60-75% Isopropyl Alcohol].  <BR>Standardization action for this product line seeks to select a vendor for a new term Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA). This product line includes the following products in the following sizes: 1) an applicator sponge device which delivers a range of 5-10 ml solution; the solution contains a range of 0.5% to 0.75% Povidone-Iodine and 60-75% Isopropyl Alcohol; 2) an applicator sponge device which delivers a range of 15-30 ml solution; the solution contains a range of 0.5% to 0.75% Povidone-Iodine and 60-75% Isopropyl Alcohol.<BR>At the request of the Pacific Regional Military Treatment Facilities, vendors will provide conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, and itemization of the brands, types, and packaging information of the products supplied by the vendor. <BR>C. Instructions to Vendors<BR>DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) Point of Contact (POC) Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address to: mary.summers1@us.army.mil AND cheryl.janus@amedd.army.mil. Submissions must be received by 5:00 post meridian (p.m.) Hawaii Standard Time (HST) on the specified closing date/time of this solicitation. Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating. All e-mail communications between vendors and the region will be digitally signed.<BR>This process will include vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge product samples and no charge literature for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC stated above that their initial submission, quotes, and literature or other requested information has actually arrived at the Regional TRBO via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  <BR>Please email product literature only to:<BR>Cindy Ingrao, RN, MSN at cynthia.ingrao@med.navy.mil<BR>Cheryl A. Janus, RN, MBA at cheryl.janus@amedd.army.mil<BR>D. Source Selection Procedures  <BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Boards (TPRBs) for the Pacific and Southwest Regions are the governing body of the standardization process and program. These boards include clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities (MTF)  within the Pacific and Southwest Regions. The Pacific and Southwest TPRBs are chaired by the respective Designated Senior Logisticians.  They are the deciding officials for this initiative. The Regions intend to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions. <BR>Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing. Additionally, the Regions reserve the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary. If industry participation is unsatisfactory, the two Regional TPRBs will decide whether to proceed with or delay the project.<BR>This source selection procedure is a one-step process. The Pacific Region TRBO will request responses to the technical/company criteria, the no charge literature and no charge sample set, and best value pricing from the vendor in a one-step source selection process. Vendors will have 30 calendar days to respond to the Pacific Region TRBO with their responses to the technical/company criteria, delivery of the no charge literature and no charge sample set to the participating MTFs, and submission best value price quotes. Vendors best value pricing will be in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format, based upon the total requirements of the Pacific and Southwest Regions. Vendors that fail to respond to the technical/company criteria or fail to send the no charge literature and no charge sample set or fails to provide a best value price quote will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization initiative. Literature and samples must be received by the participating MTFs by close of business (COB) 5:00 PM HST, 30 days after the date of request to supply samples. All vendors must send the Pacific TRBO verification regarding the date of shipment. <BR>All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed. Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing by e-mail at the conclusion of the process.<BR>Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows: 1) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence the line of products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services, 2) the vendors information provided is factually correct. Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration. Specific technical/company criteria will require an additional more specific definition of technical acceptability. The specific standard for technical acceptability will be set forth with the individual statement of each criterion, as required.<BR>The no charge samples to be provided are as follows: One Step Surgical Prep, Applicator Sponge Device, Povidone-Iodine with Isopropyl Alcohol [0.5% to 0.75% Povidone-Iodine and 60-75% Isopropyl Alcohol ] A) applicators with 10-15 ml and instructional literature - 20 (twenty) applicators to Tripler Army Medical Center, 35th MDG Misawa Japan, Naval Hospital Guam, 374th MDG Yokota Japan, Naval Hospital Yokosuka Japan, Naval Hospital Okinawa Japan, David Grant Medical Center, and the Tri-Service Regional Business Office Southwest Region.  10 (ten) applicators to 10 (ten) applicators to Naval Hospital Camp Pendleton. 5 (five) applicators to Robert E. Bush Hospital, Naval Hospital Lemoore and Weed Army Community Hospital. 2) 25-30 ml applicators and instructional literature - 20 (twenty) applicators  to Tripler Army Medical Center, 35th MDG Misawa Japan, Naval Hospital Guam, 374th MDG Yokota Japan, Naval Hospital Yokosuka Japan, Naval Hospital Okinawa Japan, David Grant Medical Center, and the Tri-Service Regional Business Office Southwest Region. 10 (ten) applicators to Naval Hospital Camp Pendleton.  5 (five) applicators to Robert E. Bush Hospital, Naval Hospital Lemoore and Weed Army Community Hospital.   <BR>Specific Clinical Product Teams (CPTs), at the designated MTFs, will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a likert type scale, with a one to five rating. One (1) = Strongly Disagree; Two (2) = Disagree; Three (3) = Neutral; Four (4) = Agree; Five (5) = Strongly Agree. The evaluating CPTs, which consist of physicians, nurses, allied health professionals, and technicians from the participating MTFs will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below. The TPRB CPT intends that clinical evaluations be conducted in a clinical (patient) setting. <BR>The Regions intend to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), on initial submission/quotes. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in the announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off the Vendor's DAPA pricing.  Pricing will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods not to exceed a total of 5 years. However, the Regions reserve the right to request revised quotes, if determined necessary. The Regions reserve the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors. Vendors that fail to submit price quotes will be disqualified from further consideration in this standardization initiative. <BR>Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance factors will be weighted more heavily than price. As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a 2-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years). The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis: (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs), (2) Impact of Unmatched Lines, (3) Potential Cost Avoidance (this is included as a reporting metric) and (4) consideration of stockage keeping units (SKUs) by each vendor. SKU review will assess the number of line items a vendor is able to supply to the MTFs versus the number of currently used line items. Cost avoidance is used as a reporting metric, not as an element of the decision. <BR><BR>Technical/Company Criteria:<BR>1. Vendor must manufacture and/or distribute a complete product line of One Step Surgical Prep, Applicator Sponge Device, Povidone-Iodine with Isopropyl Alcohol. [0.5% to 0.75% Povidone-Iodine and 60-75% Isopropyl Alcohol].  <BR> A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line. Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order. At a minimum, a complete product line includes the following products in the following sizes: 1) an applicator sponge device which delivers a range of 5-10 ml solution; the solution contains a range of 0.5% to 0.75% Povidone-Iodine and 60-75% Isopropyl Alcohol; 2) an applicator sponge device which delivers a range of 15-30 ml solution; the solution contains a range of 0.5% to 0.75% Povidone-Iodine and 60-75% Isopropyl Alcohol.<BR>Vendor must provide FDA certification, for clinical efficacy in meeting or exceeding the FDAs Tentative Final Monograph (TFM) standards for surgical preoperative patient skin prepping: Department of Health and Human Services Food and Drugs Administration, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, March 23, 2005.<BR>2. Vendors must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the One Step Surgical Prep, Applicator Sponge Device, Povidone-Iodine with Isopropyl Alcohol, product line.

(Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified).<BR>4. Vendors must provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as their DAPA price.  Therefore, FSS prices do not represent a discount off DAPA (Note that vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified).<BR>5. Vendors must have a vendor representative available in the Regions. Provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address with the initial submittal.<BR>6.

Vendors must provide One Step Surgical Prep, Applicator Sponge Device, Povidone-Iodine and Isopropyl Alcohol (PVP-I W/IPA)- [0.5% to 0.75% Povidone-Iodine and 60-75% Isopropyl Alcohol]  products which are FDA approved for use in all clinical surgical skin preparation settings and provide literature to support this requirement with the initial submittals.<BR>15. Vendors must provide a provide One Step Surgical Prep, Applicator Sponge Device, Povidone-Iodine and Isopropyl Alcohol (PVP-I W/IPA)- [0.5% to 0.75% Povidone-Iodine and 60-75% Isopropyl Alcohol]  product which is latex free. Vendor must ensure that all such latex-free products are clearly labeled as such on all exterior and interior packaging, including the individual items.<BR>16. Vendors must provide products with visible expiration dating on the labeling/packaging.<BR><BR><BR>Clinical and Performance Criteria:<BR>1.	The product container wrapping is durable and intact and ensures no leakage <BR>        of the prep solution. (Maintain sterilization of contents, maintain <BR>        integrity of materials and eliminate the potential for degradation of <BR>        materials)   [Addresses both clinician safety and cost]<BR>a.	The product wrapping is free of holes, punctures, splits in the heat sealed<BR>        edges and does not leak prep solution from any of the seams or edges.<BR>b.	This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting by use of the <BR>        product. <BR>c.	The evaluators will carefully scrutinize the entire package for any <BR>        punctures, tears or compromise to the sealed edges. The expectation is that<BR>        no evidence of breaks in the barrier of the packaging or evidence of liquid <BR>        seepage will be found. <BR>2.	The Prep Solution Applicator ensures an even application  controlled flow <BR>        of solution- onto the patients skin area. (Maintain an even application of<BR>        the chemicals to the patients skin)  [Addresses patient safety relative <BR>        to specific exposure to solution preparation chemicals and efficient use of <BR>        skin preparation tool]<BR>a.	The applicator controls the amount of solution delivered as the applicator <BR>        is applied to the skin area. No surges in the amount of liquid or leakage<BR>        from the applicator will occur.<BR>b.	This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting by use of the <BR>        product.<BR>c.	The evaluators will closely observe the applicator for any evidence of an <BR>        uneven delivery of solution. The expectation is that the applicator will <BR>        control the amount of solution delivered during use.<BR>3.	The Prep Solution Device contains an adequate amount of solution to prepare <BR>        the patients skin for surgery. (The solution amount completely covers the <BR>        surgical site area)  [Addresses both Operating Room personnel efficiency <BR>        and cost]<BR>a.	A second applicator is not required to complete the skin prep.<BR>b.	This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting by use of the <BR>        product. <BR>c.	The clinicians using this product will directly observe the adequacy of the 	amount of solution provided. The expectation is that the device will <BR>        contain the adequate amount of prep solution.<BR>4.	The solution, when applied to the surgical site, will leave an easily <BR>        identified landmark. (Visualization of the prepped skin area is clearly <BR>        distinguishable from other skin areas)  [Addresses patient safety and <BR>        infection control]<BR>a.	The prepped area of the skin will transition from a very shiny wet <BR>        appearance to a dull matted appearance. <BR>b.	This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting by use of the <BR>        product. <BR>c.	The clinicians will directly observe for this critical characteristic of <BR>        having prepped the surgical site.  The expectation is that this transition <BR>        from a shiny skin appearance to a dull matted skin appearance will occur.<BR>5.	The drying time of the solution is within the time stated by the <BR>        manufacturer. (Excessive drying time interferes with the standard of <BR>        initiating the application of surgical drapes and protective barriers to <BR>        the patient)  [Addresses efficiency of surgical time and patient safety <BR>        due to prolonged exposure of patients skin before draping]<BR>a.	The prep solution will dry in accordance with the stated drying time.<BR>b.	This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting by use of the   <BR>        product.<BR>c.	The clinicians will directly observe for the anticipated drying time. The <BR>        expectation is that the solution will dry in accordance with the product <BR>        literature.<BR>

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. 

The Intellectual and Development Disabilities (IDD) Branch Center for Development Biology & Perinatal Medicine (CDBPM) Branch, within the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), National Institutes of Health, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1) and FAR 6.302-1(a) (2) (ii) and HHSAR 306.302-1 (a) (2) (ii), a modification to its current contract with the University of Maryland at Baltimore (UMB), entitled Brain and Tissue Bank for Developmental Disorders. This four month contract extension is necessary in order to avoid a lapse in contract performance and continue services in its operation of the NICHD Brain and Tissue Bank. This modification will allow UMB to continue uninterrupted services until a new competitive contract can be awarded and the services transitioned. It is very critical that the services provided not to be interrupted, as interruption of this project would result in a loss of valuable specimens.

UMB, as the incumbent contractor, collects and houses the tissue specimens from individuals with disorders as well as normal tissue for control studies. UMB has the expertise in rapidly collecting tissue from newly deceased donors, processing the tissue and making it available for qualified researchers through a Material Transfer Agreement. In addition, UMB ensures quality standards for the repository samples including rapid collection of donor tissue, long term storage conditions, fixation procedures and fresh frozen storage conditions. A new contractor would have to develop new protocols to achieve the goals of the bank which may disrupt the distribution of tissue to the research community. This would create unacceptable delays in fulfilling the governments requirements.

However, if there are sources who feel they are able to perform the requirement, they must respond by submitting information (5 page limit) required in Numbered Note 22 within 45 days of publication of this synopsis. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within 45 days of publication of this synopsis will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Deliveries should be sent to: Hand Delivered or Delivery Service U.S. Postal Service. NO COLLECT CALLS OR FACSIMILE TRANSMISSIONS WILL BE ACCEPTED. RESPONDENTS MAY SUBMIT THEIR CAPABILITY STATEMENTS VIA E-MAIL IN ADDITION TO 2 HARD COPIES.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Edgewood Chemical Biological Center (ECBC), Technology Evaluation Branch in support of the Joint Program Manager (JPM) for Biological Defense, is sponsoring a Technology Readiness Evaluation, (TRE) 09-1 for the Joint Biological Tactical Detection System (JBTDS) Identifier.<BR><BR>The purpose of the TRE is to evaluate mature and advanced prototype biological warfare agent identification technologies using nucleic and/or non-nucleic acid detection that are fully or semi-automated.<BR><BR>Vendors both domestic and international are encouraged to respond to this opportunity with hardware and data demonstrating (a.) Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 5 or higher, (b.) ability to automatically conduct a simultaneous analysis for eight (8) or more antigens in a single two (2) milliliter liquid sample in a buffer (phosphate buffered saline, (PBS) with 0.1 % Triton at 7.4 pH) down to the species level, (c.) identify blind samples within sixty (60) minutes from time of sample introduction (includes sample prep time, if any), and (d.) performance that has at least a 90% probability of identification at 80% confidence for limit of identification for live vaccine strains of select antigens or Agent Like Organisms (ALO) and a simulant. The challenge materials are one (1) vegetative bacterium, one (1) spore-forming bacterium in crude and washed formulations, two (2) viruses and the simulant Bacillus globigii (BG) at planned concentrations of 2000 cfu/ml for spores, 1000 cfu/ml for vegetative bacteria, and 800 pfu/ml for viruses, five (5) percent or less probability of false identification, consumable operating cost less than $75 per sample challenge, size and weight or potential to be no greater than one and a half (1.5) cubic feet, and thirty seven (37) lbs. in carry configuration with sufficient consumables to analyze ten (10) samples, temperature and power operation from ten (10) degrees to forty (40) degrees Celsius, Power- standard military batteries, and potential or capability to identify additional antigens automatically (Expandability).<BR><BR>Plans are underway to conduct the JBTDS identification TRE in two (2) phases. Phase I is an assessment phase consisting of a review of the white paper proposals followed by a determination of eligibility. Candidates will be invited to proceed to Phase II and participate in a laboratory evaluation based upon a positive assessment of the information contained in their White Paper concerning the following criteria: (a.) Probability of Identification and Probability of False Identification without Interferents, (b.) Limit of identification and dynamic Range of Concentration, (c.) Set up Time, Start up time, Sample Process Time and Throughput, (d.) Power, Size, and Weight of Hardware, (e.) Simultaneous Antigen Identification, and (f.) Maturity for JBTDS Integration, (g.) Threat Coverage, (h.) built-in test (BIT) conducted automatically, (i.) Operate from standard rechargeable and non-rechargeable military batteries that provide sufficient power to analyze up to ten (10) samples within a 24 hours period at 25 degrees Celsius; (j.) Set up time less than five (5) minutes from carry configuration; and (k.) Data output ready.<BR><BR>The Government will provide Critical Reagent Program (CRP) materials to vendors participating in Phase II of the TRE. If the candidate technology is an immuno-assay based technology, CRP antibodies will be provided so the test participant may develop sufficient assays for testing. If the candidate technology is a nucleic acid based technology, then CRP Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) assays will be provided so test participants may train their instrumentation. Test participants will be constrained to the use of CRP materials for these trials.<BR><BR>Phase II operations will be conducted in the third to fourth quarter of FY 2009 in a Biological Safety Level (BSL2) facility against live vaccine strains of antigens, a simulant, and blank samples. Vendors must provide two (2) of their systems to test and a spare system for backup, for a total of three (3) systems. Vendors will operate their system during TRE for three (3) weeks.  The Government personnel at Dugway Proving Ground will operate the vendors equipment for one (1) week.  Vendors will be required to provide training to Government personnel on their system prior to the start of the Operational Readiness Inspection (ORI).  An ORI consisting of three (3) days of preliminary testing will be conducted prior to the start of TRE sample testing. A range of sample concentrations will be prepared in JBTDS phosphate buffered saline with Triton and given to vendors to process and make adjustments to their systems as required. It is estimated that during Phase II a maximum of approximately 300 blind liquid samples per vendor system (excluding the ORI) will be tested. The sample challenges will include blanks. The estimated test time is about four (4) weeks for set-up, ORI and completion of testing at Dugway Proving Ground, Utah (one (1) hour outside of Salt Lake City). Location for conduct of the TRE is the Life Sciences Division Training Area, Dugway Proving Ground, Utah.  Test participants invited to Phase II will be notified in March 2009. The selected vendors will be invited to make a technical presentation of their system (Industry Days) in April 2009. Briefings will be provided by the Vendor in a PDF format, along with ten (10) copies of their briefing. The ECBC TRE 09-1 Team will coordinate with each vendor the schedule of vendor presentations, where to send the ten (10) copies of the vendor presentation, and briefing location that is to be determined (TBD).<BR><BR>The vendors White Paper proposal will be tailored to include system information and be formatted as follows: The  proposal format is Times New Roman, not less than eleven (11) point as follow: The content will address the Technology Employed, System Nomenclature/Title, Detailed System Description, Cost, Biological Agent Capability List and Sensitivity, Physical Properties, Power Requirements, Equipment Operating Procedures and Safety Precautions, Auxiliary Support Equipment (if any), Performance Test Data including, Test Reports, and Logistics Requirements.  The White Paper is limited to ten (10) pages maximum excluding test reports. <BR><BR>To be responsive to this announcement, vendors must supply their white paper proposal in writing to U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM), 5183 Blackhawk Road ATTN: AMSRD-ECB-RT-DE (Daniel M. Nowak), Building E3326, Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD 21010, no later than close of business on 9 March 2009. <BR><BR>Concurrently an electronic copy of the white paper in PDF format will be place in this electronic Drop Box [https://dropbox.apgea.army.mil/cgi-bin/dropbox.pl]. Access to the ECBC drop box can be done from any Browser. The Recipient Email Address for the Drop Box is: monica.kelley1@us.army.mil. ONLY PDF FORMAT IS ACCEPTABLE FOR INFORMATION SUBMITTED.

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 

(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) warrants; (ii) options; (iii) contracts to acquire stock; (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e). Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

Are either pick up points beyond a security desk that would force us to relinquish our firearms? 2.      Will our guards be forced to be escorted to the pick up point?3.      Is there anything else we need to know about that would add additional time to our crew once we arrive at the location?4.      We only authorize our crew to sign the Deposit Log that we issue to all our customers.  Is that an issue?5.      We certainly can and will take full responsibility for any deposit(s) we sign for at either location.  However, for pricing purposes if you could give me the average daily Cash and Check breakdown amount I can present you with a more competitive price.  Otherwise I would have to assume that we will be required to insure $1M per pick up which would be quite costly.6.      Time of pick up and delivery of deposits is very restrictive. Can the locations be more flexible?  For example, the vast majority of our customers are set up with "in route" service (service can be provided anytime throughout the customer's hours of operation).  This allows us to be even more competitive with our pricing.  This is very important to know because there is a very good chance that we would not be able to satisfy the very restrictive times noted in the scope of services. 
 Answers: 1.  No
2.  no
3.  no
4.  no
5.  Maximum liability is $50,000 per pick up/delivery per day.  If we had a deposit that exceeded this amount this office would make the deposit themselves.   
6.  I understand the times are quite restrictive, but they are very important.<BR><BR>

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA), will be seeking proposals from Proteomic Center contractors to develop and enhance proteomic technologies and use them to gain a greater understanding of physiological pathways, molecular interactions, and regulatory signals, as well as begin to apply the technologies and knowledge to clinical questions.  
Each NHLBI Proteomic Center contractor will integrate expertise in multiple disciplines (proteomics, physiology, clinical studies, molecular biology, genomics, chemistry, physics, engineering, computational biology, bioinformatics, and biostatistics) to advance proteomic applications in heart, lung, blood, and sleep diseases and disorders.  Each NHLBI Proteomic Center contractor will identify and address a specific clinical need/problem/disease/process (see examples directly below) using three components that make an interactive team:  1) proteomic technology development; 2) mechanistic and functional understanding of the proteome, its interactions and dynamics and 3) clinical application of proteomic approaches and discoveries.  The components should be interdependent and drive each others science and progress.  
Examples include, but are not limited to:
Transplantation  Develop novel approaches for measuring the proteome, subproteome, and/or post translational modification (PTM) that will predict rejection; study the interaction and pathways of these molecules; and measure the unique proteome, subproteome or PTMs in patient samples in order to model outcome or improve treatment predictions.
Cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure  Develop innovative proteomic technologies and computational approaches (e.g., to model and integrate multiple data types from genomic and proteomic studies) and apply them to the discovery of clinically-useful markers of adverse cardiac remodeling; develop technologies, methods and probes (e.g., high-affinity ligands, antibodies, etc.) to measure and quantify the presence of such markers in biological samples or in the body (e.g., using imaging probes) for early diagnosis or to assess therapy efficacy.
Myocardial ischemia  Develop technologies and methods to identify biomarkers (e.g., proteins, polypeptides, PTMs) for early detection and diagnosis of myocardial ischemia; test technologies and methods in at-risk populations.
Thrombosis  Develop proteomic profiling methodologies to identify patterns for thromoembolic risk stratification; examine pathways underlying the expression patterns using novel protein interaction and modification technologies; test patterns in patient samples to model risk for development or recurrence of a thromboembolic event.
Atherosclerosis  Predict and measure molecular determinants of plaque stability and vulnerability; develop risk prediction assays for plaque rupture in acute coronary syndrome patients and in patients presenting with shortness of breath and chest pain.    
Arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death:  Develop innovative methods and approaches to identify proteins, peptides, post-translation modifications, or other biomarkers to identify those at highest and lowest risk of developing potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmias in patients with implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs); access these approaches in model systems and human samples.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  Develop approaches for expression profiling; determine molecular phenotype of COPD using protein expression profiles of epithelial cells from bronchoalveolar lavage; model and develop standardized molecular phenotype profiles in patients to determine treatment course.
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) - Develop tools and applications for the discovery of protein expression profiles or biomarkers that are associated with PAH; test the findings retrospectively or prospectively in any clinical study of PAH.
Sleep apnea - Develop tools and approaches for the discovery of biomarkers of sleep apnea and biological timing; study sleep apnea with other co-morbid conditions (e.g., a variety of cardiovascular and metabolic abnormalities) that could facilitate the elucidation of pathophysiological mechanisms of sleep apnea and other conditions as well.
Hemoglobinopthies:  Develop tools and approaches to better understand protein profiles for the altered red cell function due to mutations in various membrane or skeletal proteins; discover and test biomarkers for modifier genes that define susceptibility to stroke in sickle cell patients. 
Bone marrow failure: Develop tools and applications for the discovery of protein expression profiles or biomarkers for ribosomal proteins associated with erythroid bone marrow defect and other related bone marrow failure disorders; model and test pathways that could lead to prediction, prevention, and treatment strategies.
Each Proteomic Center will be expected to enhance proteomic tools and technologies with the goal of using them for mechanistic and functional understanding of heart, lung, blood, and sleep diseases and disorders.  Enhancement of proteomic tools and technologies can include hardware or software to improve the measurement, characterization, or comparison of proteins, peptides, PTMs, isoforms, genomic/epigenomic tags, small molecules, or other related cellular or tissue components.  Mechanistic and functional understanding can include, but is not limited to, experimental and/or computational approaches to molecular function/dysfunction, dynamics, interactions, pathways, process, transport, or other related actions, in cells, tissues, organs, and whole organisms. The Centers should also work with an eye toward clinical studies using the proteomic tools, technologies, mechanisms, and functional understanding to guide human subject studies.  It is expected that all Centers will have human research studies during the course of the project period.  The Centers should leverage existing resources to support these human subject studies, such as CTSA, clinical networks, ongoing clinical trials, ongoing cohort studies, and industry supported studies.  
It is critical that the funded Centers interact to share information on technical objectives, progress and impediments, as well as exchange ideas, and, where appropriate, establish collaborations.  Thus, all research products and results must be made available to the research community in a timely fashion.  Each Center will have a project plan that will address milestones, deliverables, and sharing. A Progress Review Panel will provide feedback and advice to both the Centers and to NHLBI.
THIS PRESOLICITATION NOTICE IS NOT THE REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP); the Request For Proposals will be available on or about January 26, 2009.  This solicitation will not be open to Federally Funded Research Development Centers (FFRDCs).
JANUARY 26, 2009 - THIS NOTICE HAS BEEN UPDATED TO INCLUDE THE ACTUAL SOLICITATION.  ALL PROPOSALS IN RESPONSE TO THIS SOLICITATION ARE DUE MAY 20, 2009, WITH THE PROPOSAL INTENT RESPONSE DUE ON APRIL 20, 2009 (SEE ATTACHED RFP DOCUMENTS FOR FURTHER DETAILS).

Your response to this RFI will be treated as information only. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses to this announcement or the Government use of such information.  This request does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract.  No funds have been authorized, appropriated, or received for this effort. The information provided may be used by the Army in developing its acquisition strategy and statement of work/statement of objectives and performance specifications.  Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response.   The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information submitted in response to this RFI. <BR><BR>The Counter Radio Controlled Improvised Explosive Device (RCIED) Electronic Warfare (CREW) program provides the army and other military services and government agencies with an electronic warfare capability to counter the threat from RCIEDs.  The CREW program is comprised of numerous systems, which fill a wide range of the electronic warfare requirements.  The CREW systems protect the members of U.S. forces operating in, or primarily stationed in Iraq, and Afghanistan in support of U.S. operations in the Global War on Terrorism including Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF). <BR><BR>The Product Manager, CREW has identified the need for CLS Support for the AN/VLQ-14(V) 1, Mobile Multi Band Jammer (MMBJ) 2.1 System (approximately 3,000 Systems). Impact Science and Technology (IST), a wholly owned subsidiary of ITT Force Protection Systems Division, is the developer and only manufacturer of the AN/VLQ-14(V)1 MMBJ 2.1 System.  This CLS requirement is based on a directive from the Joint IED Defeat Office (JIEDDO) that is the oversight authority for CREW product development and production.  JIEDDO has officially established that once the CREW systems (like the MMBJ) have completed fielding and are designated for transition to a particular service, then it becomes that services responsibility to support, sustain and maintain these systems.  Within the Army, PM CREW has been identified to become the service organization responsible to provide these critical and timely support functions for the MMBJ 2.1.       <BR><BR>The United States Army CECOM LCMC is conducting this market survey to determine price and availability from potential sources capable of fulfilling a 5 Year Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) effort.
