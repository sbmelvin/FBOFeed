<SUBJECT>99--AVAILABILITY OF TRIAL PERIOD COMMERCIAL USE AUTHORIZATION FOR GUIDED TECHNICAL SCUBA DIVING - B-29 BOMBER SITE LOCATED IN THE OVERTON ARM OF LAKE MEAD NATIONAL RECREATION AREA, NV
<DESC>SUBJECT: AVAILABILITY OF TRIAL PERIOD COMMERCIAL USE AUTHORIZATION FOR GUIDED TECHNICAL SCUBA DIVING - B-29 BOMBER SITE LOCATED IN THE OVERTON ARM OF LAKE MEAD NATIONAL RECREATION AREA Under the authority of Section 418 of the National Parks Omnibus Management Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-391), the National Park Service announces the availability of two Commercial Use Authorizations (CUAs) for Guided Technical Scuba Diving at the B-29 Bomber site located in the Overton Arm of Lake Mead National Recreation Area ("Park"). This commercial service will consist of guided technical scuba diving in and around the Overton B-29 Site, where the remains of a downed World War II vintage B-29 bomber are located.  This site has been determined eligible to be on the National Register of Historic Places.  This commercial service will be authorized for a six-month trial period during which time the Park will assess the effectiveness of the permit holders to preserve and properly manage the B-29 site. The number of dives and divers will be limited.  During this trial period, the Park may make appropriate adjustments to the guided dive service.  These adjustments could include:  the right to halt, temporarily suspend, and/or increase or decrease the carrying capacity of this service to address impacts on the Overton B-29 Site.  The number of CUAs available for this commercial service is being limited to two (2) permittees in order to preserve and properly manage Park resources and values (consistent with the National Park Service's legal obligations under 16 U.S.C. §5966(b)(2)(D).  A multi-step process will be used to select the permit holders.  In the first step of the selection process, applications will be reviewed for completeness and timely submission.  In the second step of the process, applications will be evaluated and their relative qualities assessed on the factors specified in the instructions for the application forms. Any CUAs issued will be subject to a number of terms and conditions concerning the qualifications and certifications of the dive guides, diving operations (including safety), insurance and other liability requirements. Consistent with the limitations on CUA authority, all commercial activities authorized by the CUA must begin and end outside of the Park boundary.  A CUA of this type may not authorize solicitation of customers, sales, or payment for commercial services to take place within the park area; all of these activities must occur outside of the Park boundary.   The National Park Service will accept only one application per individual, company or other legally recognized entity for a CUA for this specific category of commercial services.  To be considered, an application must be received no later than 4:00 p.m. (PST) on Friday, May 18, 2007 (see application for details and address). Application forms and additional CUA information and requirements may be obtained on the Lake Mead National Recreation Area website at www.nps.gov/lame  (see B-29 Guided Technical Diving CUA Application quicklink on the front page), or by contacting:  Heidie Grigg, CUA Program Manager, (702) 293-8923, Lake Mead National Recreation Area, Concession Management Division, 601 Nevada Way, Boulder City, Nevada  89005.

The Accelerant Detection Canine Program places accelerant detection canines with State and local law enforcement and fire service agencies to support their arson investigation activities.  The Explosives Detection Canine Program was initiated through an agreement with the Department of State to train explosives detection canines to be used overseas in the war against terrorism.  In addition, the Explosives Detection Canine Program trains explosives detection canines for Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies.

b)	The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) is contracting for a skilled technician with specialized knowledge and ability in the care, safe handling, and health management of canines.  The ATF canines are housed at the ATF Canine Center located in Front Royal, Virginia.  The workforce at the Center is composed of canine technicians and a canine center supervisor who are responsible for the care and health of approximately 45-70 canines housed in the kennel at any given time. The contractor performs the same work as the Canine Center technicians. 

2.	Requirements

BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION REQUIREMENTS

The Contractor shall be responsible for ensuring that all Contractor employees assigned hereunder shall undergo a Background Investigation to determine their suitability to access ATF facilities, proprietary information, and data, including ATFs automated information system.  The Background Investigation will be conducted by or under the auspices of the Personnel Security Branch, Office of Professional Responsibility and Security Operations, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). It is the responsibility of the Contractor employee to provide the necessary security package in a timely manner, through the assigned Contracting Officers Technical Representative (COTR), to ATFs Personnel Security Branch so that a Background Investigation can be conducted.  

The Contractor shall screen and review each potential Contractor employee and ensure that each potential Contractor employee to be assigned to this contract possess a personal history that is in compliance with DOJ and ATF personnel security guidelines and will permit each employee to successfully pass a Background Investigation conducted by the ATF.  Prior to requesting the potential contractor employee to complete necessary security package, the Contractor shall screen the following aspects of each potential contractor employees personal history:

a.	Criminal conduct
b.	Financial responsibility
c.	Drug use 
d.	Employment 
e.	Selective Service registration, if male
f.	U.S. Residency
g.	Country of citizenship

During the Contractors review of each potential Contractor employees personal history, the contractor is required to review each potential Contractor employees personal security package to ensure the forms are fully complete, signed, and dated.

The Contractor is hereby advised that a Background Investigation may take ninety (90) days or more to complete, depending on the complexity of the investigation.  The contractor is encouraged to fill all positions with employees who have recently been the subject of a Limited Background Investigation (LBI), Background Investigation (BI), or Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) and/or who possess a Top-Secret clearance, or a Secret clearance based on a LBI or BI.  The Contractor shall submit documentation proving such Investigation was conducted or clearance granted with the Contractor employees complete security package.   

In those instances where the Contractor believes that it (or any of  contractors employees) will not need unescorted access to any ATF facilities, or access to any ATF proprietary information, data or automated information systems, the Contractor shall notify the COTR.  The COTR will then apprise ATFs Personnel Security Branch of the Contractors initial determination, citing the reasons therefore.  The Personnel Security Branch, in consultation with the COTR or Bureau Contracting Officer, will make the final determination as to whether or not the contractor employee will need to undergo a Background Investigation.  The nature and specific degree of Background Investigations will be determined by the Personnel Security Branch, depending upon the nature and degree of risk associated with the contract position.

At the conclusion of the Background Investigation, the Personnel Security Branch will annotate ATF Form 8620.5, either granting or denying access, and return a copy of the form to the COTR.  The COTR is then responsible for advising the Contractor of ATFs determination.  In those instances where access is granted, the COTR will be responsible for securing from the Contractor employee an executed ATF Form 8800.2, Conditional Access to Sensitive But Unclassified Information Non-Disclosure Agreement for Contractors.  Access to ATF facilities, proprietary information, data, or automated information systems is not authorized until such time as an executed ATF Form 8800.2 is delivered to the Personnel Security Branch, Room 2474, 650 Massachusetts Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20226, unless initially submitted with the security package.

Contractor employees are not authorized to access ATF facilities, proprietary information, or data, including ATFs automated information systems, until such time as they have been favorably adjudicated by the Personnel Security Branch in accordance with the adjudicative guidelines as directed by the Department of Justice.

RESIDENCY REQUIREMENT

All Contractor employees assigned to this contract and working within the United States shall meet the DOJ Residency Requirement.  The Residency Requirement states that, for three (3) of the five (5) years immediately prior to applying for a position, the individual must have: 1) resided in the United States; 2) worked for the United States overseas in a Federal or military capacity; or 3) been a dependent of a Federal or military employee serving overseas.

This requirement can be waived for short-term (i.e., those employees performing duties for a cumulative total of fourteen (14) days or less) if there is a critical need for their specialized or unique skills (for example, interpreters for rare foreign languages).  These individuals must be United States citizens or Permanent Resident Aliens.  A waiver request from the head of the Component outlining the extenuating circumstances along with the requisite contractor clearance package shall be submitted through the COTR to the Department Security Officer (DSO) for approval.  Each waiver request will be reviewed by the DSO and a determination made on a case-by-case basis.

The Department of Justice does not permit the use of non-U.S. citizens in the performance of this contract or commitment for any position that involves access to or development of any DOJ Information Technology system.  By signing the contract or commitment document the contractor agrees to this restriction.  In those instances where other non-IT requirements contained in the contract or commitment can be met by using non-U.S. citizens, these requirements shall be clearly described.  Additionally, any individual, whether employee or contractor, who is not a U.S. citizen must be from a county allied with the United States.  Since countries on the allied nations list are subject to change, refer to the following website for current information: http://www.opm.gov/employ/html/Citizen.htm

FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

Contractor employees who have delinquent unpaid debt may be required to provide proof of payment and/or proof of participation in a payment plan.  If this documentation cannot be provided, the Contractor employees Background Investigation may be terminated and/or access to ATF facilities, proprietary information and data, including automated information systems will be denied.

DOJ & ATF POLICY VIOLATIONS

A Contractor employee who is in direct violation of a policy established by DOJ or ATF may be denied access to ATF facilities, proprietary information and data, including automated information systems, without being offered an opportunity to mitigate the information.

DENIAL OF ACCESS TO ATF FACILITIES, INFORMATION & DATA, AND AUTOMATED SYSTEMS

In the event that a Contractor employee be denied access to ATF facilities, proprietary information and data, including ATFs automated information systems, the Personnel Security Branch will notify the Contractor employee of ATFs determination, citing the specific reasons for denial.  The Contractor employee will be afforded fifteen (15) days to provide mitigating circumstances to the Chief, Personnel Security Branch.  If the Contractor employee fails to provide mitigation within the allotted fifteen (15) days, the COTR, the Bureaus Information Security Officer, and the Physical Security Programs Branch will be notified that the Contractor employee has been denied access and the matter will be closed.  In the event the Contractor employee provides sufficient mitigation to warrant reconsideration of the original determination, the COTR and the Bureaus Information Security Officer will be notified via ATF Form 8620.5 that access has been granted to the Contractor employee.

Should a Contractor employee be found unsuitable, he or she may ask to review the investigative file by filing a request under the Freedom of Information Act with the Disclosure Division, Room 8400, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, 650 Massachusetts Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20226.  It is the responsibility of the Contractor employee to assume any and all monetary liabilities associated with such request. 

In addition, if ATF denies a potential or current Contractor employee possessing the appropriate level of Background Investigation or security clearance as previously identified above, the Contractor shall deduct $1,100 from its next invoice for each denied potential or current Contractor employee, which corresponds to the cost to ATF to conduct the Background Investigation.
