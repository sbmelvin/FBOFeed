The Joint Contracting Command-Iraq/Afghanistan (JCC-I/A) intends to issue a Request for Proposals for the procurement of Emergency Response and Dignitary Protection Training Academies on or about 4 February 2007.  The intended contract will be for training only and does not include a contract requirement for Life Support.  The Civilian Police Assistance Training Team (CPATT), National Police Support Team (NPST) and Professional Development Training (PDT) is currently responsible for training, equipping and basing a specialized national law enforcement capability within Iraq to counter terrorists, insurgents and criminal activities, quell large-scale civil disobedience and protect high-level dignitaries. Currently, training at the National Police Training Academies, Camp Dublin focuses on maintaining the capability of the Emergency Response Unit (ERU), Provincial Special Weapons and Tactic (SWAT) Teams,  the personal security details of high-level governmental officials that are trained at the Center for Dignitary Protection (CDP), teaching the Iraqi National Police how to conduct the day to day Base Support Operations (BSO) necessary to maintain the camp after the transition of control to the Government of Iraq, and teaching certain leadership and select skill courses to members of the National Police as directed.  There are also cooperative training programs in place with the Ministry of Justice and United States Marshall Service to provide similar training as the needs occur.  The CPATT staff is also assisting with the stand-up of the 1st and 2nd Divisions of the National Police. In order to build the ERU Battalion capability, thirteen (13) Basic Crisis Response and five (5) Advanced Courses have been conducted as well as Leadership and Train the Trainer courses. The site has provided an ERU training and operational mentorship program that acts in an advisory capacity to the ERU Operating Companies. The training site assisted in building Provincial SWAT capabilities by conducting twenty-six Basic Provincial SWAT courses. By conducting a total of fifty-seven (57) Tier I and Tier II courses, this CPATT training site supported the creation of a high level government dignitary protection force for Iraq. The site provided a mentorship/advisor program for the Iraqi Tier 1 Dignitaries.  The Dignitary Protection Services (DPS) assisted in building skilled Iraqi Tier I PSDs who have assumed the responsibility of protecting the lives of their respective Principals, the DPS also functions as a liaison element for Multi National Forces Iraq Strategic Operations Protection (MNF-I STRATOPS), Multi National Forces Iraq Personal Security Coordination Cell (PSCC), Multi National Forces Iraq Joint Area Support Group (JASG), and CPATT.  Tier I dignitaries include but not limited to the President, two Vice Presidents, Prime Minister of Iraq and the Speaker of the Council of Representatives.

The ERU Iraq Training cadre is assisting with the conduct of the ERU Basic and Advance Courses as well as ERU Train the Trainer, and Leadership courses. The CDP will have an Iraqi training staff capable of sustaining Protective Security, Close-In Protection, Site Security and Motorcade escort courses.  The BSO will continue to train members of the National Police in how to conduct the day to day operations of the camp.  The training will not be limited to the Core Logistics Courses, Apprenticeship program and mentorship of trainees.  The Tier 1 Advisors will continue to function as mentors to the Tier 1 PSDs and as liaisons to MNF-I.  It should be noted that due to the restricted nature of the training and missions conducted from Camp Dublin that the awardees will not use the camp for an equipment staging or storage area and/or temporary billeting for personnel supporting other contract operations in the CENTCOM AOR.  The anticipated award date for the any resultant contract is 15 March 2007.  Award will be made pursuant to a written solicitation which will be made available through the Government-wide Point of Entry (www.fbo.gov).
