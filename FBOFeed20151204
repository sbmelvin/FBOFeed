<DESC><p>The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), 711th Human Performance Wing (711 HPW), Human-Centered Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) Division, Human Trust and Interaction Branch (711 HPW/RHXS), seeks innovative research to develop human language technologies (HLTs) that will provide the warfighter with enhanced capabilities to utilize and exploit foreign language information.  Much of the information needed to effectively understand, anticipate, manage, and operate in the global environment is found in foreign language speech, text, videos, and images; however, there is a critical lack of linguists and automated tools to understand, translate, and to effectively exploit this information.  This shortfall is especially common and problematic for lesser spoken languages that have high military interest but lack sufficient linguists and automated language processing capabilities.  Even for languages where speech and other language processing tools do exist, overall accuracy and performance can still be insufficient, depending on the domain and application, to effectively support operations.</p>
<p>The objective of this program is to conduct research and develop HLTs in the areas of automatic speech recognition (ASR), machine translation (MT), natural language processing (NLP), information extraction (IE), information retrieval (IR), text-to-speech synthesis (TTS), and other speech and language processing technologies.  Major application areas of interest include multilingual multimedia information extraction and retrieval (MMIER) and speech-to-speech translation (S2ST).  The HLT Program within 711 HPW/RHXS has developed an in-house prototype system for MMIER called "Haystack" and has also developed a prototype S2ST system.  Research and technology developed under this effort will be integrated into these applications, the applications configured for individual customer requirements, and then ultimately transitioned for operational use.  Research will be conducted at the Unclassified, Secret Collateral, and Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) level.  The anticipated dollar value for this acquisition is $10M over a 5 year period of performance.</p>
<p>This is a pre-solicitation notice only.  It is anticipated that a BAA providing more details into this program will be released in the January 2016 timeframe.  The BAA will be available at www.FedBizOps.gov.  An Industry Day will be held shortly after the BAA is posted.  Direct any questions to the contracting points of contact identified in this announcement or the technical point of contract, Mr. Joseph Steuver, 711 HPW/RHXS, phone 937-255-8015, e-mail: Joseph.Steuver.1@us.af.mil.  Persons planning to attend the Industry Day must have at least a Secret Clearance.  Appropriate clearances and base access must be obtained in advance.  Questions regarding clearances/base access may be directed to Ms. Michelle Grigsby, 937-255-8229, Michelle.Grigsby.1@us.af.mil.  Please note that requirements may change and this is not a guarantee that a solicitation will follow.</p>

This is a Notice of Contracting Action (NOCA) to announce the Government&rsquo;s intention to pursue a sole source procurement for the Independent Readiness Review Team (IRRT) services managed by Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) Engineering Division (SMC/EN). The Government intends to award a limited sources task order under a General Services Administration (GSA) Consolidated Federal Supply Schedule. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>As set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 8.405-6(a)(l)(i)(A), an urgent and compelling need exists and following the competitive ordering procedures would result in unacceptable delays. This NOCA does not constitute a Request for Proposal, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the Government to release a competitive solicitation or award a contract or task order. The sole purpose<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>of this bridge contract is to ensure the mission requirements identified below continue to be met until the full and open follow-on competitive task order for IRRT support, which is currently underway, is awarded. The Government will not recognize any costs associated with submission of information in response to this notice. The Government will not pay for any effort expended in responding to this notice. </span></span></p>

b.	Company point of contact, address, telephone number, and status of the company; (i.e., small business, HUBZone business, etc.)
c.	Provide your companys portfolio as it relates to:
1.	Design-build in general.
2.	Specific application to water treatment facilities.
3.	Similar size/type of WTP needed for this project that you have designed and/or built.
4.	Highlight any innovative treatment (design or construction) techniques you have used to reduce cost and/or maintenance time.
d.	Describe your companys experience in designing water treatment plants for natural organic matter reduction, including but not limited to biofiltration and other treatment processes.

d.	List of projects using this treatment process.

DESIGN DATA

A.  The CLWTP will serve the Eastern portion of the NGWSP and will consist of a water treatment plant (WTP) and pumping plant.  The Cutter Lateral obtains water from Cutter Reservoir, an existing regulating reservoir on the Navajo Indian Irrigation Project.  

B.  Hydraulic Data
1.	WTP
The WTP will be designed and built for the 2020 demand with the capability of being expanded for the 2040 demand (Table 1).  The influent /effluent difference assumes an approximate 4% required maximum loss through the WTP.

Table 1:  Year 2020 and 2040 water demands
Units	Demand	2020	2040
		Influent	Effluent	Influent	Effluent
MGD	Maximum Day	4.0	3.8	5.6	5.4
	Average Day	3.1	3.0	4.3	4.2
	Minimum Month	2.5	2.4	3.5	3.3

2.	Pumping Plant
Pumping Plant shall be designed for sufficient head (420 feet) to pump water to proposed operating storage tank elevations at the following flow rates (Table 2):


Table 2:  Year 2020 and 2040 pumping plant flow rates
Year	Units
	(CFS)	(GPM)
2020	5.9	2,700
2040	8.3	3,800





C.  Water Quality Data
1.	Raw Water Quality
The source water is a reservoir with a good water quality.  See the 4/6/2015 water sample highlighted water quality results (Table 3).

Table 3:  Highlighted water quality results (4/6/2015 sample)

	Analyte	Value	Units
General	Alkalinity (Total)	81	mg/L
	DOC	2.5	mg/L
	Hardness	101	mg/L as CaCO3
	pH	8.1	
	TDS	160	mg/L
	TOC	2.6	mg/L
	TSS	4.5	mg/L
	Turbidity	4.5	NTU
	UV	0.079	cm-1
Ions	Arsenic	0.001	mg/L
	Bromide	<0.2	mg/L
	Chloride	<10	mg/L
	Iron	0.14	mg/L
	Manganese	0.002	mg/L
	Sodium	15	mg/L
	Sulfate	45	mg/L

2.	Finished Water Quality
a.	Finished water must meet all USEPA primary and secondary drinking water standards.  
b.	The primary finished water quality parameter of concern is natural organic matter and the resulting disinfection byproduct formation.  This is due to the long distribution system length.  
c.	The finished water DOC concentration will need to be approximately 0.5 mg/L.

D.  Treatment Constraints 
1.	96% overall WTP water recovery
2.	Use of chloramines is not permitted

<DESC>1. Please provide FEMA any overall comments and/or feedback which you feel would strengthen the Statement of Objectives (SOO) NFIP requirements<br />2. Please provide FEMA any weaknesses and/or requirements you think are unattainable and which your company believes that FEMA should reconsider, along with your reasoning as to why this is the case
<p><br />REQUEST FOR INFORMATION<br />NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM<br />Direct Servicing Agent</p>
<p>1. BACKGROUND<br />FEMA's Federal Insurance and Mitigation Administration (FIMA) operates the NFIP, which was created by an Act of Congress in 1968. The NFIP makes flood insurance available to residents and businesses of participating communities that commit to sound flood plain management practices.<br />The NFIP sells and administers Standard Flood Insurance Policies in two ways:<br />(1) Through an arrangement with private Write Your Own (WYO) insurance companies (under authority of 44 CFR Section 62.23); and <br />(2) Through a contract with an entity that directly sells and services NFIP policies, the NFIP Direct Servicing Agent (DSA).</p>
<p>Since 1983, the Write Your Own (WYO) Program has become the primary vehicle for delivering and servicing flood insurance with participating insurance companies, who write nearly 80% of the NFIP's policies in their own names. The Government bears the underwriting risk for these policies, as well as for the policies issued by the DSA. <br />2. FIMA SCOPE &amp; MISSION<br />While the WYO companies and the NFIP's contractors - DSA, Marketing, NFIP-IT Systems and Services, etc. - each have separate responsibilities vis-a-vis the NFIP, the success or failure of the NFIP will hinge on the interaction and cooperation of all cohorts working as a team to ensure the smooth, seamless flow of information to all internal and external stakeholders and partners. FEMA must have a comprehensive, coordinated approach to delivering products and services to customers at all levels. A failure by a single entity at any level may lead to program failure. It is the responsibility of all contractors and WYO companies to participate as team members with all others. To this end, FEMA has established Universal Objectives for all contractors, which FIMA would like to see incorporated into responses.<br />2.1 Universal Objectives<br />2.1.1. Universal Objective A: Leverage technology, relationships, and mutual interests across the public and private sectors to improve project delivery and effectiveness in order to increase risk awareness, leading to citizens and communities taking mitigation action to substantially reduce risk to life and property and increase the Nation's resilience to natural hazards.<br />2.1.2 Universal Objective B: Provide a high level of cooperation and integration across all FIMA contractors, ensuring seamless and integrated program delivery. Offer subject matter expertise as required (e.g. business requirements, training development, authors, committees, etc.).<br />2.1.3 Universal Objective C: Implement sound program management practices to enable reliable and efficient operations, support of FIMA Governance structures, and forward-thinking innovation throughout the NFIP program. <br />2.1.4 Universal Objective D: Assist with the design, implementation, communication, and/or management of new and revised requirements, processes, and procedures resulting from the Biggert-Waters National Flood Insurance Program Reform Act of 2012 (BW-12), Homeowners Flood Insurance Affordability Act (HFIAA), Presidential Policy Directive-8 (PPD-8), the National Mitigation Framework (NMF), the National Disaster Relief Framework (NDRF), and other statutory and regulatory changes impacting the NFIP program. Promote integration with FIMA, FEMA, DHS, and Other Federal Agencies' programs.<br />2.1.5 Universal Objective E: Assist with and support the transformation of Customer Experience across the NFIP.<br />3. PURPOSE<br />The purpose is to obtain contract support for NFIP direct services and to obtain the outcomes described herein to improve FEMA's responsiveness and quality of customer experience to its policyholders; respond effectively to flood events and disasters; and provide efficient and effective process administration and program performance. <br />FEMA requires the continuous review and improvement of existing processes and tools as the environmental, technological, and political considerations impacting the program continue to evolve. <br />4. PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES, GOALS, AND OUTCOMES<br />FEMA requires that the proposed solutions comply with all statutes and demonstrate working knowledge of applicable regulations, policies, guidelines, and specifications that affect the NFIP, FIMA, FEMA, and DHS. FEMA has highlighted some of these regulations, policies, guidelines, and specifications that are specific to the NFIP. Solutions must demonstrate innovation, flexibility, subject matter expertise, and increasing efficiencies while delivering increased effectiveness given the government's continuing resource constraints.

<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency intends to award a Cost Plus-Incentive Fee/Award Fee contract modification to the existing Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) Development and Sustainment Contract (DSC); Contract HQ0147-12-C-0004 to The Boeing Company (herein Boeing), 499 Boeing Blvd., P.O. Box 240002 Huntsville, Alabama 35824-6402. This effort is for the acquisition of Re-designed Kill Vehicle (RKV) development including: payload development; payload ground testing; integration with the Ground-Based Interceptor (GBI) and GMD Ground System; flight testing; several test assets; and up to eight initial production units. The anticipated period of performance for this effort will be six years, extending the current DSC period by three years, but only for this additional RKV development effort. This acquisition will be executed on a sole-source basis under the statutory authority of 10 United States Code 2304(c)(1), as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy Agency requirements. Boeing is the designer, developer, manufacturer, and integrator of the GMD GBI. Boeing, along with its RKV Cross-Industry team of sub-contractors, comprised of Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company, and The Raytheon Company, provide a consolidated product that includes the collective knowledge of all three Contractors. The outcome of this integrated team provides competitive benefits to the Government. The Cross-Industry team will incorporate the most viable technical approaches from each Contractor, combining resources that will complement each other's unique capabilities to shorten the learning curve, and reduce the time needed to develop and begin initial production. Boeing as the GMD DSC Prime Contractor and the Cross-Industry Team, collectively, have demonstrated special capabilities and/or expertise that no other company is known to have the capacity to satisfactorily perform the required services or deliveries without unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Agency's requirements.
<p><br />Companies interested in sub-contracting opportunities should contact Mr. Charles R. Harwood 256-937-4335 or Charles.r.harwood-ii@boeing.com.</p>

<DESC>This synopsis provides notice of the Government's intent to solicit a proposal on a sole source basis from incumbent BAE Systems Technology Solutions &amp; Services at 520 Gaither Road Rockville, MD 20850 for 417,339.00 hours of Communication-Electronic (CE) Platforms support services. This is necessary for the continuance of <span style="COLOR: black; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin">contractor support services to the Special Communications Requirements (SCR) Division of the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) at St. Inigoes, MD. The contractor support services will include the rapid design, development, customization, manufacturing, fabrication, integration, test and evaluation, installation, certification, maintenance and upgrade, logistic, and life cycle support of new and/or existing CE Platforms, equipment/systems and subsystems. </span>The proposed bridge contract is needed for continued support services currently being performed under contract N00421-09-C-0102 and mirror contract N00421-14-C-0042, while the follow-on contract is being completed with an estimated award date in February 2017. This requirement will be a Cost-Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) bridge contract<span style="LETTER-SPACING: -0.1pt">. </span>Due to the ongoing nature of the support services currently being performed under contract N00421-09-C-0102 and mirror contract N00421-14-C-0042 and the need to continue these services with a minimal break in work; BAE is the only practical source for providing the necessary continuation of these services until award of a competitive follow-on contract. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. However, responsible interested parties may submit information in which they identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider all information received by 26 March 2015 1630 EST. A determination by the Government not to compete this procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government will not pay for any information received. No telephone responses will be accepted. Any questions shall be submitted to Carolyn Emmart, Code 2.5.1.3.9, via email at carolyn.emmart@navy.mil.
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Per FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." BAE is the sole source capable of providing these support services without creating an impact on the sponsor schedules, project schedules, operations and operational readiness that would be caused by a break in service. It is unrealistic, from a technical and contractual perspective, to expect any other potential source to provide continued services prior to the competitive contract being awarded. Because of the nature of this requirement and the impracticality and substantial costs the Government would incur and not recover through competition, this will be procured on a sole source basis.</p>

This requirement will be a Cost-Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) bridge contract<span style="LETTER-SPACING: -0.1pt">. </span>Due to the ongoing nature of the support services currently being performed under contract N00421-09-C-0102 and the need to continue these services with a minimal break in work; BAE is the only practical source for providing the necessary continuation of these services until award of a competitive follow-on contract. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. However, responsible interested parties may submit information in which they identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. For subcontracting opportunities please contact Ms. Noreen Seevers at Noreen.seevers@baesystems.com. The Government will consider all information received by 22 April 2015 1630 EST. A determination by the Government not to compete this procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government will not pay for any information received. No telephone responses will be accepted. Any questions shall be submitted to Carolyn Emmart, Code 2.5.1.3.9, via email at carolyn.emmart@navy.mil.
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Per FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." BAE is the sole source capable of providing these support services without creating an impact on the sponsor schedules, project schedules, operations and operational readiness that would be caused by a break in service. It is unrealistic, from a technical and contractual perspective, to expect any other potential source to provide continued services prior to the competitive contract being awarded. Because of the nature of this requirement and the impracticality and substantial costs the Government would incur and not recover through competition, this will be procured on a sole source basis.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) Orlando intends to solicit and negotiate on a sole source basis, a contract for the procurement of twenty-eight software upgrades with Windows 10 and Parasim Version 6 for inclusion in the Parachute Descent Virtual Reality Trainer (PDVRT) under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  
The PDVRT is a simulator that provides training for airborne premeditated, static-line and freefall operations and for aircrew emergency bailout and ejection. This training system in its current state utilizes Parasim software 2.5 which operates on the Windows XP platform.
 DOD cybersecurity requirements per November 20th, 2015 mitigation to Microsoft Windows 10 Memorandum requires all previous versions of Windows be updated to Windows 10. The currently utilized version of Parasim software is not compatible with Windows 10, dictating that the training software be updated to the latest version Parasim Version 6. The PDVRT and the accompanying Parasim software is solely manufactured and distributed by Systems Technology, Inc.(STI).
Upgrading the existing twenty-eight trainers includes new computer systems (1 for each training station) with Windows 10 and Parasim Versions 6 software pre-installed; and all required hardware upgrades. Additionally, it provides software updates for the Parasim software over the life of the system and installation and travel costs for STI to perform the upgrade at all 8 sites.
FAR Part 12.101(b) states that agencies shall acquire commercial items or non-developmental items when they are available to meet the needs of the agency. Since Parasim Version 6 is the only commercial item that is compatible with the PDVRT, this acquisition will be sole source.
This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals.
 It is a notice that outlines the Governments intent to contract on a sole source basis with Systems Technology, Inc. Interested sources desiring to contest this synopsis may do so by asserting its supportable rationale via email to Carly Galloway, Carly.Galloway@navy.mil in an electronic format that is compatible with Word 2010, no later than 21 December 2015 at 1300 EST.

All information shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government.  No solicitation document is available. If no written contest to this synopsis is received, a Justification and Approval (J and A) in accordance with FAR Part 6.303 based on the rationale provided above will be initiated.

<DESC>The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Acquisition Management (OAM) intends to award a sole source purchase order for the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention (OCSPP) Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) Biological and Economic Analysis Division (BEAD) under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(2) and FAR 13.501(a) to GfK Kynetec (GfK) for Agricultural Pesticide Usage Data.

The EPA requires web-based access to the GfK Kynetec AgroTrak database which includes the following: a) All crops and all pesticide types-database access; b) Historical years database access 1998-2013; c) 20 GfK AgroTrak Licenses; d) 2014/2015 Percent Crop Treated, Specialty and Row Crops; e) 75 Client service hours; and f) On-site AgroTrak Robust and I-map Training (2 Sessions). The required period of performance for this purchase is January 1, 2016  December 31, 2106 with a one-year option from January 1, 2017  December 31, 2017.

In order to adequately evaluate health, environmental, social and economic aspects of the use of substitutes for pesticides, a database is needed which contains accurate, current usage data for agricultural pesticides by chemical active ingredient, end-use product, pesticide type, and crop protected. The type of usage data needed includes the following: total and base acres treated, total pounds applied, the number of farms treated, the time of application, the stage of the pest infestation, pesticide prices and expenditures, the rate of application, target pest and pest complex, the method of application, and other related factors, by state or designated region. This purchase will make available to EPA pesticide market survey data and reports for 1998-2014 and the associated Percent Crop Treated files, which will serve as a critical input in conducting economic and related analyses of pesticide regulatory matters. These data are for internal use within the EPA, not for release to nonsubscribers or the general public.
 
NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE FOR THIS PROCUREMENT. It has been determined that GfK is the only source for this data that meets the Governments requirements. No other source has been identified which can provide required information. Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting EPAs requirement as stated herein, may submit its capability by Thursday, December 17, 2015, which may be considered by the Government. A determination not to compete the purchase order based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All questions or comments regarding this procurement shall be addressed in writing to Christine Edwards at edwards.christine@epa.gov.

<p>The selected 8 (a) firms will be required to perform at least 50 percent of the contract work with the prime's labor force in accordance with FAR Part 52.219-3.</p>
<p>3. SELECTION CRITERIA: Selection criteria for this acquisition are listed below in descending order of importance (first by major criterion and then by each sub-criterion), Criteria: Architects-Engineers primary criteria: items (f)-(h) are the secondary criteria and will only be used as "tie-breakers" among firms that are essentially technically equal.</p>
<p>(a) Specialized Experience and Technical Competence: Ensure that all special experience requirements are reflected on appropriate personnel resumes in Section E, Part I of the SF 330. The firm must demonstrate expertise in the following and must highlight the areas that meet these requirements so the reviewers can find that the requirements have been met:</p>
<p>(i) Recent experience, within the past five (5) years from the closing date of the synopsis, and significant/specialized experience in the design of new and existing military or military type facilities (for example a civilian motel is similar to a military barracks) and utility infrastructure and design of repairs, renovations and alterations of existing facilities and infrastructure at Military Installations paying particular attention to area architecture and conditions, utility systems, landscaping, interior design, value engineering and environmental issues. There must be a minimum of three (3) examples, of such recent experience showing specialized experience and technical competence in the design of Military type facilities with over $300,000 in design fees by your firm. The dollar value limitation will apply to cumulative past design experience within the past 5 years-not individual examples greater than $300,000. Specify the dollar amount of design/A-E Services actually performed by the firm on all the projects submitted. For example, if the firm performed $100k of mechanical design on a $2M project, submit the amount of design/A-E Services as $100k, not $2M. Failure to do so will cause rejection of the submittal. If the project is an IDIQ-show projects designed under the individual task orders. Do not just show an IDIQ as a project. The Government must see what the project actually consisted of. Military construction experience will be given more weight than military type construction projects.</p>
<p>(ii) Firms must demonstrate the capability to design projects to LEED certification criteria and to perform ASHRAE Level I, II &amp; III Energy Audits.</p>
<p>(iii) Firms must demonstrate at least five (5) years' experience, from the closing date of the synopsis, in Fire Protection and Life Safety Design in the use and application of NFPA codes 70 and 101. Experience with UFC 3-600-01, Design: Fire Protection Engineering for Facilities, which replaced MIL-HDBK 1008C, is also acceptable. It is insufficient to assert that the firm can meet these requirements. Show specific projects and list what codes they have been designed under. This applies to all of section 3 a requirements-show projects that meet the requirements and highlight how the requirements are met.</p>
<p>(iv) Firms must demonstrate experience in design and survey (including use of X-ray fluorescence devices) required for abatement of asbestos and lead-based paint.</p>
<p><br />(v) Firms must demonstrate past performance in preparing studies, design-build solicitations and design-bid-build solicitations, at Army and Air Force installations is preferred.</p>
<p>(vi) Firms must demonstrate the ability to prepare construction cost estimates, using the MII program, latest version, is preferred.</p>
<p>(b) Professional Qualifications: This Indefinite Delivery Contract (IDC) will require the A-E Contractor to demonstrate that all expertise requirements are reflected on key personnel resumes in section E, Part I of the SF330. When a minimum number of years/experience is listed, it is from the closing date of the synopsis.</p>
<p>Evaluation of each discipline will consider education, registration, relevant project experience within the last ten (10) years, and longevity with the firm. The asbestos/lead-based paint survey personnel shall demonstrate (listed experience on their resume) experience with x-ray fluorescent devices. Repeat Resume Page as needed to provide all required resumes.</p>
<p>The following is a list of the key personnel, minimum requirements and the minimum number required under this acquisition. These minimum requirements can be met utilizing in-house or consultants/subcontractors. Do not list a subcontractor as your firm's employee. This will be cause for rejection of the SF330.</p>
<p>(i) Two (2) Project Managers, minimum of five (5) years' experience, on vertical construction type projects, PMP certification highly desired. Saying an individual has for example ten years' experience without showing at least one project that was completed five years ago or longer will be cause for rejection of the submittal.</p>
<p>Three (3) registered Civil Engineers,<br />Three (3) registered Structural Engineers, <br />Three (3) registered Architects, <br />Three (3) registered Electrical Engineers, <br />Three (3) registered Mechanical Engineers, <br />Two (2) registered Environmental Engineers,<br />One (1) geotechnical Engineer,<br />One (1) certified Environmental Survey person (asbestos, lead-based paint, soil, etc),<br />One (1) environmental design person (asbestos, lead-based paint, soil, etc),<br />One (1) certified Cost Estimator with MII experience. <br />One (1) licensed professional Land Surveyor and one (1) survey crew</p>
<p>Each discipline shall have a minimum of five (5) years' experience in their field of expertise for all positions listed in this paragraph except for the survey crew. If the experience listed in the resume doesn't go back at least the five years that are required, the submittal will be rejected.

<DESC><strong>PLEASE NOTE THIS WAS PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED UNDER W91238-15-R-0069.</strong>
<p>This Indefinite Delivery Requirements Single Award Task Order Contracts will be for emergency levee repair requirements. By its nature, this authorization covers no-notice events and mission critical requirements that cannot be met through a normal acquisition process and schedule. This acquisition will provide the contractual vehicle to meet the Sacramento District's mission responsibilities for direct support during a declared emergency. The contract resulting from this acquisition will replace three expired IDIQ Requirements SATOCs for emergency levee repairs, which expired 5 April 2013. This contract will have a 3-year base period and one 2-year option period with a total maximum contract capacity not to exceed $47M. The minimum ordering limit will be tiny_mce_marker and the maximum-ordering limit will be $47M. Being that we do not know the size of the emergency, it is important that we have the maximum flexibility in ordering what we need, when we need it.</p>
<p>The NAICS code is 237990, with a size standard of $36.5 million.</p>
<p>All questions should be directed to the Contract Specialist, LTC Tande, Chris, email: Bradley.c.tande@usace.army.mil or (916) 557-5156.</p>
<p>The RFP solicitation is anticipated to be posted on or about 4 January 2016.</p>
<p>OFFERORS ARE ADVISED THAT THIS PROJECT MAY BE DELAYED, CANCELLED OR REVISED AT ANY TIME DURING THE SOLICITATION, SELECTION, EVALUATION, NEGOTIATION AND/OR FINAL AWARD PROCESS.</p>
<p>Ordering Solicitation:</p>
<p>Plans and specifications will NOT be provided in hard paper copy or CD format. The solicitation and all amendments for this acquisition will be posted on a secure Government website known as FedBizOpps (www.fbo.gov) once the Request for Proposal (RFP) is issued. For further information, please click on the FedBizOpps homepage link and the Vendor User Guide.</p>
<p>The only PLAN-HOLDER'S/BIDDER'S LIST now available is via FedBizOpps. When viewing the Synopsis/Pre-solicitation Notice, you will click on the 'ADD ME TO INTERESTED VENDORS' to enter your information. This function does not, however, allow you to identify yourself as a Prime or Sub. It is recommended that you identify your category in parentheses at either the beginning or end of your company name. For example: XYZ Construction (Prime/Sub). IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CONTRACTOR TO CHECK FEDBIZOPPS FREQUENTLY FOR ANY AMENDMENTS OR CHANGES TO THE SOLICITATION.</p>
<p>NOTIFICATION OF BUNDLING DoD CONTRACTS: Per DFARS 205.205-70, the Contracting Officer has determined this requirement meets the definition of bundling per FAR 2.101. The definition states, "Consolidating two or more requirements for supplies or services previously provided or performed under separate smaller contracts, into a solicitation for a single contract that is unlikely to be unsuitable for award to small business." The previous acquisition included one large business and two small businesses. The capacity was $24M per year for a total of five (5) years and $96M. As stated above this new requirement will be for a total contract capacity of $47M and be solicited as an unrestricted requirement. The Contracting Officer has further concluded the bundling is necessary and justified by measurably substantial benefits exceeding 5% of the contract value in quality improvements, reduction in acquisition cycle times and administrative savings.</p>

NLT 31 December 2018 <P> This partnership opportunity is being issued to interested and qualified teaming partners to help a NASA/GSFC instrument concept study and to provide a flight qualified instrument subsystem should the instrument be down-selected for flight. This partnership opportunity is for the design, fabrication and delivery of a dewar for the mid-infrared instrument. Selection will be based on the best value to the government. <P> For this partnership opportunity dealing with the Instrument Concept Study, there will be no exchange of funds between the teaming partners. Partner(s) will be funded according to the budget developed during the Instrument Concept Study phase should the investigation be competitively selected for those additional phases. NASA/GSFC reserves the option to not select any teaming partners under this POD offering on the basis of materials received. <P> 2.0 Subsystem Overview <P> GSFC is interested in finding a partner to fabricate an airborne-flight qualified Dewar. No other subsystems are part of this POD. <P> Detailed information on the Dewar specifications will be provided to those responding with a Notice of Interest. A Notice of Interest (intentionally not called a notice of intent) does not obligate an organization to provide a POD response. <P> 3.0 Pre-selection Support <P> Instrument Concept Study and Instrument Concept Study Proposal Support SOW: It is expected that the selected respondent will provide support using their own resources (no exchange of funds) to help develop and write the Instrument Concept Study Report (CSR) and support any NASA HQ SMD imposed regularly scheduled status meetings, Preliminary Design Review (PDR)  level reports, reviews, and implementation plans (including, but not limited to schedule, costs, and risks) as described in the SOFIA third-generation science instrument NRA in response to the NRA in the area of the Dewar. This will involve meeting/discussion with the scientists and the instrument engineering and management team: (a) to help define the end-to-end performance and interface requirements; and (b) to predict performance, for inclusion in the final Concept Study Report. This will include cost estimation for each and all instrument phases. The period of performance for this interval is expected to last until submission of the Instrument Concept Study Report and supporting Site Visit(s) and potentially other requirements imposed by NASA HQ SMD until a down-select announcement for the implementation of a third-generation instrument.

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this project is 541990 with a size standard of $15.0 million.
<p>Your response to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement as a set-aside based upon responses to this Notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.<br />Interested parties are expected to review this Notice and the draft Statement of Work to familiarize themselves with the requirements of this project; failure to do so will be at your firm's own risk.</p>
<p>Background:<br />Since its creation as an independent Center in 1998, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) has developed a broad research portfolio focused on a variety of complementary and integrative medicine practices. These practices are a group of diverse medical and health care systems, interventions, and products that are not generally considered part of conventional medicine. In view of its expanding portfolio of clinical research, this new solicitation provides for the support of the NCCIH Clinical Studies Monitoring Services (CSMS) Contract to enhance clinical studies oversight by the NCCIH Office of Clinical and Regulatory Affairs (OCRA).</p>
<p>Over the past decade, the evidence base regarding efficacy and safety of integrative medicine practices have grown substantially in both quality and quantity. Basic research and clinical trials, both large and small, have yielded results-both "positive" and "negative"-that inform consumers' use of and health care providers' recommendations concerning integrative medicine. It is also apparent the nearly 40% of the US public practice some form of integrative therapy on a regular basis. Increasingly, the evidence base is permitting systematic reviews that point toward helpful conclusions regarding safety and efficacy or lack thereof, rather than simple statements that more or better quality research is needed. There is also evidence that this body of research has influenced consumers. For example, both NHIS data and industry sales figures suggest that the results of several large clinical trials have affected both the frequency of use and sales of non-vitamin/non-mineral dietary supplements. In addition, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has taken actions to address concerns about the safety of some complementary and integrative medicine products as a direct result of research.</p>
<p>Growth in the quality and quantity of the evidence base reflects substantial growth in complementary and integrative medicine research capacity, much of which is a direct result of NCCIH-led and -supported activities to attract scientists to the field, establish multidisciplinary research collaborations, and train investigators in research. In view of extensive use by the public, NCCIH is committed to further research on complementary and integrative medicine practices. State-of-the-art research methods and tools are being employed to assess and develop two broad categories of research funded by NCCIH-botanical products &amp; dietary supplements and mind/body &amp; manual therapies. Research is now a specific focus of several international organizations, including the Consortium of Academic Health Centers for Integrative Medicine, the International Society for Complementary Medicine Research, and the Society for Integrative Oncology, as well as various national governments (e.g., China and India) and the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>The NCCIH currently funds a broad portfolio of clinical studies that investigate complementary and integrative medicine practices with biologically-based or mind/body-based interventions http://NCCIH.nih.gov/research/results/spotlight/atoz.htm. The biologically-based interventions include those such as dietary supplements (i.e., omega-3 fatty acids, creatine), probiotics, and botanical products (i.e., silymarin, saw palmetto extract). As many of the biologically-based studies funded by NCCIH focus on a specific disease or condition of use, many such studies are conducted under an IND issued by the FDA. By contrast, the mind/body-based intervention studies include modalities such as yoga, Tai Chi, meditation, acupuncture, massage therapy and chiropractic manipulation. The majority of NCCIH-sponsored clinical research is conducted in single-site studies, and is conducted at academic medical centers, hospitals, clinics and physician offices through a variety of funding mechanisms such as cooperative agreements, grants, and contracts. In addition, a few studies are conducted outside of the US, in Canada, and Peru.. NCCIH also supports an intramural clinical research program at the NIH Clinical Center. The NCCIH clinical research portfolio therefore incorporates many scientific disciplines and includes studies of diverse design, clinical setting, size and complexity.</p>
<p>In view of the diverse scope of NCCIH-funded clinical studies, the NCCIH/OCRA plays a primary role in clinical studies oversight for the approximately 150 ongoing clinical projects. Monitoring of clinical sites is one element of a larger program of clinical studies oversight developed by OCRA to fulfill its responsibilities of ensuring the safety and welfare of participants, of maximizing adherence to appropriate clinical research regulations and guidelines and maximizing data quality from NCCIH funded studies.</p>
<p>NCCIH has a growing clinical research program that conducts research on promising complementary and integrative therapies for treatment or symptomatic relief of numerous diseases and conditions. Such studies of complementary and integrative practices involve varying degrees of risks to participants. This relative risk, as well as the scope and complexity of the research will influence the extent of external monitoring required by OCRA. The CSMS Contract will therefore provide support for ongoing site monitoring in NCCIH-funded clinical studies that are identified by OCRA, and addresses the compelling need to provide monitoring to insure that studies are conducted in the most scientifically valid, safe, and efficient manner possible.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives:<br />The purpose of this Small Business Sources Sought Notice (SBSS) is to identify qualified small business concerns that are interested in and capable of performing the work described herein.

This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.</p>
<p>Background: The National Institute on Aging (NIA), one of the 27 Institutes and Centers of NIH, leads a broad scientific effort to understand the nature of aging and to extend the healthy, active years of life. The Intramural Research Program (IRP) of the National Institute on Aging (NIA) provides a stimulating setting for a comprehensive effort to understand aging through multidisciplinary investigator-initiated research, in this regard.</p>
<p>The Laboratory of Epidemiology and Population Sciences (LEPS), one of NIA IRP's ten laboratories, plans, conducts, and directs epidemiology, demography, and biometry programs relevant to the mission of the NIA. Within LEPS, the Health Disparities Research Section (HDRS) conducts interdisciplinary clinical and basic science research focused on examining the underlying cause of the disproportionate incidence, morbidity and mortality of age-related disease among minority and low socioeconomic status (SES) Americans. Dissecting the interaction of race, socioeconomic status, culture, behavior, environmental exposure, biologic vulnerabilities, genetics, social environment, health care access, and quality of health care provides insight into how these interactions result in disproportionate rates of age-related disease and disability. The ultimate goal of this approach is to transform scientific discoveries arising from laboratory, clinical, or population studies into clinical applications to reduce incidence, morbidity, and mortality of age-associated diseases and health disparities. This is accomplished by the development and implementation of a clinical component (The Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span (HANDLS) study) and a basic science laboratory component that are interdependent and pursuing related hypotheses.</p>
<p>HANDLS investigators conduct their research study on NIA's mobile Medical Research Vehicles (MRVs) located throughout Baltimore City, MD. The HANDLS participants are transported to the MRV location where examinations are performed daily.  The MRVs are staffed with a physician, nurse practitioner, registered nurse, cardiac technician, community coordinator, cognitive tester, and an ultra-sonographer, who administer a combination of clinical and research procedures that provide the study with necessary data and the participants with valuable health information. It is critical that the program (MRV) is fully staffed on testing days.  MRVs are open 5 days per week (Monday - Sunday), with a rotating schedule for weekend work.</p>
<p>The HANDLS Clinical Nurse Practitioner is responsible for screening, conducting history and physicals, follow up assessments and interventions for HANDLS research participants on the HANDLS Medical Research Vehicles (MRVs).

<p>Background:  The National Institute on Aging Intramural Research Program has embarked on a longitudinal study of the effects of race and socioeconomic status on healthy aging in a representative sample of community-dwelling  residents from the Baltimore metropolitan region. This study, Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span (HANDLS), requires expertise in database management, web design, the connection between web interfaces and data, and application life-time development techniques.</p>
<p>In addition to modifying existing web applications, expertise is required to complete the development of web-based data collection tools to support the clinical research conducted by the HANDLS study. The web-tool provides the ability to collect the clinical data in the mobile research vehicles and subsequently to upload the data to servers located in the Biomedical Research Center (BRC). This integrated web&shy; based system requires ongoing maintenance and enhancements, as well as tools for monitoring performance, particularly disconnections.  Moreover, these applications must account for security and confidentiality of the information and data collected, clinical informatics and database design that can be supported with open-source tools, and web applications that meet current design standards and accessibility requirements, including Section 508 for accessibility by individuals with disabilities. The website requires continued architecture of a system to replace the current authentication systems on the HANDLS servers to meet NIH standard.</p>

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought / Request for Information only, as well as an Industry Day Announcement. There will be no solicitation issued at this time. This posting is intended to further identify potential business sources with the resources, capabilities and experience required to provide engineering services to the Joint Test and Evaluation (JT&amp;E) Program, as described below, and encourage teaming arrangements between companies with the required capabilities. A draft copy of the Performance Work Statement (PWS) for W91C9G-16-R-0001 and two (2) sample task orders are provided as attachments to this notice.
<p>This notice is being used for the purpose of determining market interest, availability and adequacy of potential business sources prior to establishing the method of acquisition and issuance of a Request for Proposal, including the use of any appropriate small business programs. All interested businesses are encouraged to respond; however, those businesses or joint ventures who responded to the previous RFI (W91C9G-14-A-JTE1) must clearly identify any information in their white paper that has been updated. The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this Sources Sought notice. Any information submitted by respondents to this Sources Sought is strictly voluntary. This notice is for informational and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bid or proposals, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Federal Business Opportunities website located at http://www.fbo.gov for the release of any follow-on information.</p>
<p>Information obtained from this notice will be reviewed to determine whether partial socioeconomic set aside(s) are feasible for performing the services identified herein. The anticipated NAICS code is: 541330. The engineering services needed for this acquisition do not require performance by a licensed engineer, and are not appropriate for procurement using Brooks Act A-E procedures.<br /><br />This is a follow-on effort for the Deputy Director, Air Warfare (AW), in the Office of the Secretary of Defense (Director, Operational Test and Evaluation) (OSD (DOT&amp;E)) to provide technical and engineering services to the JT&amp;E Program. The OSD sponsors the JT&amp;E Program to conduct tests and evaluations and provide information required by Congress, OSD, the Unified Commands, and Department of Defense (DOD) components relative to joint operations. Congress established the JT&amp;E Program in 1972 after a Presidential Commission concluded that the DOD had no capability to conduct test and evaluation in a joint environment.</p>
<p>The objective of a JT&amp;E is to (a) assess Service system interoperability; (b) evaluate joint technical and operational concepts and recommend improvements; (c) validate testing methodologies that have multi-Service applications; (d) improve Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) applications; (e) increase joint mission capability, using quantitative data for analysis; and (f) provide feedback to the acquisition and joint operations communities.</p>
<p>The program is responsible for providing or obtaining technical and engineering analysis across the range of test activities. Test activities include&nbsp; test design; planning/execution and reporting. Specific activities include: test, engineering, planning; modeling and simulation, training, programming, data collection and analysis, hardware and software configuration and documentation, programming, integrated logistics functions, resource and program control, and development of briefings, test results, and technical reports.</p>
<p>The JT&amp;E process is composed of three separated but closely related activities: (a) the nomination, coordination and consideration of the nomination for inclusion in the JT&amp;E Program; (b) a Joint Feasibility Study (JFS) determination of the need and feasibility of approved nominations; and (c) the chartered joint tests (JT) which are the execution of these approved nominations that show potential for significant improvements in joint military capabilities. This acquisition will include both the JFS and the JT portions of this process. Also included are Quick Reaction Tests (QRT), which are short duration (approximately one year) tests in response to Warfighter emergent requirements, and Tests and Evaluation (T&amp;E) tasks, which provide T&amp;E services to various military organizations.</p>
<p>The JT&amp;E Program requires technical and engineering analysis across the range of test activities to include the preparation of technical reports, test design and planning, field test activities, data collection, data processing and analysis, hardware and software configuration and documentation, programming, analysis of system performance and related data, modeling and simulation, training, instrumentation and facilities, integrated logistic functions, resource and program control. The majority of the JT work shall be performed in the three Joint Test Units located at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland and Suffolk, Virginia. QRT and T&amp;E task work may be conducted at any site both CONUS and OCONUS as identified by the Government in the specific task orders.</p>
<p>Although the current contract is unclassified, the project problem statements are classified; therefore, prime contractors are required to attend classified briefings prior to proposing on all task orders. Currently these classified briefings are conducted at least five (5) times annually, either at the JTU in Suffolk, VA or at the Pentagon in Washington, DC.<br /><br />All contract work is currently being provided by task orders awarded through four indefinite delivery contracts. The total capacity for the ten-year period on the current contracts, which ends January 07, 2017, is not to exceed $930 million. <br /><br />Companies who desire to participate in this market survey are encouraged to submit a white paper which supports the company's claim that it presently has the technology, qualifications, and capabilities and teaming arrangements to satisfy the objectives described above. The white paper should discuss the company's experience and ability to perform the services and include relevant subcontractors and discuss teaming arrangements that would be utilized to perform the work; and should include points of contact and DUNS number or CAGE code for the prime contractor. In addition, please state whether or not the company has a facility clearance (FCL) at the Top Secret level. The white paper should be prepared in MS Word or Adobe, limited to four pages, and submitted electronically to Phoebe.V.Fuller@usace.army.mil by 4:00 p.m. January 12, 2016. The company shall be responsible for any costs associated with preparing responses to this market research. All requests for further information must be made in writing or via email; telephone requests for additional information will not be honored. The government will review submissions as they are received.</p>
<p>Interested parties shall submit their interest, certified business size (e.g. Large Business, or Small Business) in accordance with NAICS Code 541330, and questions regarding the upcoming acquisition of the JT&amp;E Program via email to: Phoebe.V.Fuller@usace.army.mil. All contractor questions must be submitted via the aforementioned email address, and not by telephone. Please note this Sources Sought posting expires on January 12, 2016 at 4:00pm (Central Time Zone).</p>
<p>In addition, ERDC CT intends to conduct an Industry Day on January 5, 2016 from 9:00am to 4:00pm CST at US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Engineering Research and Development Center (ERDC), 3909 Halls Ferry Rd, Vicksburg, MS 39180.</p>
<p>The Government will present an overview brief of the requirement, followed with one-on-one side sessions. The one-on-one side sessions shall be available only upon request and will be limited to 30 minute intervals per company. The purpose of the one-on-one sessions shall be for each company to present their capabilities and informal discussion of the program, to include any suggestions of how to structure the solicitation to enable greater competition. Due to the limited capacity of the Industry Day location, only two (2) attendees from each company shall be permitted to attend Industry Day and side sessions, if requested.</p>
<p>All interested offerors must register to attend the Industry Day via email to Phoebe Fuller no later than December 30, 2015. Required information is as follows: Company Name, Address, POC Name and Phone Number, CAGE Code, Number of Attendees (no more than 2) including Names and Titles, and the offeror's interest in a one-on-one side session. All requests must be submitted via email - no phone calls. Registrants will receive additional information via email regarding access to ERDC. Any questions to be addressed during the Industry Day must be submitted with registration.</p>

MARCORSYSCOM seeks potential technology design solutions to produce the assemblies and correct obsolescence issues for the eyepiece and detector, including other components as appropriate. Acceptable solutions may include a redesign/reconfiguration of the circuit board processing stack and MARCORSYSCOM may accept solutions that bring the MRTB to the current state of technology. <br /><br />MARCORSYSCOM will provide a limited number of MRTB AN/PAS-28s as Government Furnished Equipment to develop, test, evaluate, and validate the solution. Government Furnished Equipment is unavailable to support responses to this RFI.</p>

<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI) and not a solicitation. The Air Force Research Laboratory Sensors Directorate (AFRL/RY) would like to investigate the feasibility of transferring and maturing AFRL's AlGaN/GaN mm-wave MMIC process to a domestic DoD/commercial foundry to ensure DoD access to broad-band, highly efficient MMICs.  This would include the maturation of this process to a Technology Readiness Level of 6 and a Manufacturing Readiness Level of 6.  AFRL seeks to obtain information from US foundries and device designers concerning their interest in the development of an open AlGaN/GaN foundry utilizing AFRL's (or similar) mm-wave MMIC process. The Government anticipates those who respond to this request for information to either be focused on GaN MMIC foundry or GaN MMIC design.

<p>December 02, 2015</p>
<p>The Bureau of Reclamation, Grand Coulee Power Office, Grand Coulee, Washington, awarded purchase order R15PX01218 on a sole source basis, to Abb Inc., Cary, NC. The Bureau of Reclamation had a requirement for three circuit breaker overhauls to be performed at the Grand Coulee Power Office.

As the manufacturer of the circuit breakers, ABB is uniquely qualified to supply the overhaul kits and perform the maintenance, no other company has the required expertise to furnish and provide the technical assistance in the overhaul of this proprietary equipment.</p>
<p>A Determination to Solicit Sole Source has been prepared in support of this acquisition.</p>
<p>This unrestricted procurement was awarded using Simplified Acquisition procedures. The award date was September 18, 2015 in the amount of $64,707.00.

<DESC>INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE<br /><br />Capitol News Company, LLC d.b.a. Politico, SS-CFPB-16-016
<p>The Bureau of Fiscal Service (Fiscal Service), on behalf of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), intends to contract with Capitol News Company, LLC d.b.a. Politico, 1000 Wilson Blvd., 8th Floor, Arlington, VA 22209, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 6.302-1, for a subscription to Politico Pro. Politico has been identified as the only source capable of providing the required content in an arrangement that suits the needs of the CFPB.</p>
<p>The mission of the CFPB is to educate the consumer as a first line in defense against abusive practices; to enforce consumer financial laws via the supervision of banks, credit unions and other financial companies; and to gather and analyze available information to better understand consumers, financial service providers, and consumer financial markets. In order to meet the above listed missions, the CFPB is establishing a library to serve as a focal point for reference materials that not only show current events, but events through the course of history that have shaped the financial environment as we know it today.</p>
<p>POLITICO Pro is the only source with real-time and valuable behind the scenes information that is essential for CFPB to respond quickly and plan a strategy on the most pressing issues out of Washington D.C. Pro has over 100 policy specific beat reporters who are experts in their field, providing subject matter expertise in fourteen different policy areas. Due to such a large reporting staff, POLITICO Pro is able to provide more granular coverage of the back and forth discussions that occur before a law or regulation is finalized. CFPB users will have their own individual accounts to receive email alerts in real-time on the political risks that impact the market they work in. Each user has access to a list of 100+ subtopics within each policy area selected by CFPB. The list shapes what issues; committees, agencies, and/or individuals subscribers wish to receive real-time updates &amp; analysis on. In addition, users will receive morning and afternoon newsletters, breaking news alerts, and have access to POLITICO Pro's Congressional Directory, which contains contact information on Hill staffers and Members. Since the CFPB conducts financial market research, it was found that the content contained in Politico Pro's product is crucial to the successful completion of the CFPB mission. Access to all of Politico's news stories will allow CFPB users to receive up to the minute alerts which will result in thorough research of a wide range of information critical to creating accurate and effective work products, thus enabling CFPB to make well-informed decisions in regards to marketing, management, MIS, POM, accounting, finance, and economics.</p>
<p>The identified contractor, Capitol News Company, LLC d.b.a. Politico, is the publisher and is currently the only source for subscription.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by December 11, 2015 @ 2 pm.</p>
<p>Responses shall be submitted electronically to purchasing@fiscal.treasury.gov, Attn: TAshcroft, TWhite</p>

Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>This is a Notice of Intent, not a request for proposal.

All lasers models 1) Sapphire 488-100 Blue Lsr #640100, NO-SERIAL-2827, 2) COHR Compass Green 315M-150 Lsr, #640102, NO-SERIAL-2828, 3) LSR Red Laser, #337691, NO-SERIAL-2829, 4) Laser Violet 405-100, #647316, NO-SERIAL-2830, 5) Sapphire 488-100 Blue Lsr, #640100, NO-SERIAL-6024, 6) Laser Violet 405-100, #647316, NO-SERIAL-6026, 7) COHR Compass Green 315M-150 Lsr, #640102, NO-SERIAL-6025, and 8) LSR Red Laser 628-200, #337691, NO-SERIAL-6027 must be compatible with existing equipment and no substitutions are allowed. As the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) Becton, Dickinson and Company deems necessary to maintain the equipment in accordance with their required specifications without the lasers the above reference instruments will be rendered non-functional. There is no known lasers offered that will physically fit inside the instruments to provide the optimal signal strength and power to accommodate the functioning of the instrument. To use a different vendor for these lasers will cause the instruments to not be able to be calibrated to optimal specifications such that samples between experiments will not be able to be analyzed and compared. This would adversely affect the function of the lab and its mission. The place of performance is for a base year plus one (1) year option period (1/1/2016 - 12/31/2017). Place of delivery is Bethesda, Maryland 20892. The statutory authority for this sole source requirement is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 only one source available, no substitutions possible, and replacement parts must be compatible with existing equipment. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. All responsible sources that can provide these services may submit a response that will be considered. The response should include the certification from Becton, Dickinson and Company that you are authorized to obtain OEM parts to maintain the above reference equipment. All responses in writing, by email to Tonia Alexander at talexander@niaid.nih.gov, by 5:00 pm eastern standard time Monday, December 14, 2015. All responses received by the closing date of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA/OAR/ARL/ATDD, plans to solicit and negotiate on a sole source basis, in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, with Texas AgriLife Research to provide site support and maintenance for the Beeville, Texas, AIRMoN Site TX03.  Period of performance:  Requirement is for a base year, plus two option years based on availability of funding as noted below.
<p>Base Year:		January 14, 2016 - January 13, 2017<br />Option Year 1:  		January 14, 2017 - January 13, 2018<br />Option Year 2:		 January 14, 2018 - January 13, 2019</p>
<p>The Beeville, Texas TX03 station (located approximately 4 miles northeast of Beeville, Texas)is one of approximately 250 stations in the National Atmospheric Deposition Program National Trends Network (NADP/NTN), a joint venture between NOAA, EPA, USDA, USGS, and several other state, federal and private organizations designed to determine trends in the nation's precipitation chemistry.  The Texas station was chosen to fill a specific ecoregion through a rigorous procedure developed by NADP/NTN in approximately 1982.  The Texas site meets NADP siting guidelines and has operated satisfactorily since it began operation in 1984.  Current costs are modest; moving the site or changing the site operator will disrupt a working arrangement that was quite difficult to establish - and selected using a competitive process.  More importantly, moving the site will destroy continuity of our data record, the most important consideration in a trend determination process.</p>
<p>Tasks to be performed.</p>
<p>The work to be performed by Texas AgriLife Research at the Beeville, Texas station as part of the National Atmospheric Deposition Program/National Trends Network will be to continue monitoring precipitation chemistry on a weekly basis according to the methods specified by the NADP/NTN Central Analytical Laboratory in Champaign, Illinois.  The effort requires the following:</p>
<p>-	Routine (at least weekly) maintenance of Aerochem Metrics precipitation 	collector and official recording gauge.</p>
<p>-	Collection of all precipitation samples on a weekly basis for the entire year.  Follow the weekly Tuesday to Tuesday sample collection schedule and submit samples with a completed Field Observer Report Form (FORF) and rain gauge record to the Central Analytical Laboratory (CAL) for analysis.</p>
<p>-	Packaging and shipping of samples to the Central Analytical Laboratory 	according to NADP/NTN protocols at least once per week.</p>
<p>-	Site and equipment maintenance as necessary.</p>
<p>Deliverables:</p>
<p>The operator shall submit all required documentation and site operations forms, sample collection forms, etc., to NADP/NTN and shall maintain an electronic log for maintenance, calibrations, etc.  The full requirements for site operation are specified in the National Trends Network Site Operation Manual:  http://nadp.sws.uiuc.edu/lib/manuals/opman.pdf.  Support is to be performed on Tuesdays to stay within NADP operating protocols for NTN sample collection.</p>
<p>Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within ten days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<p><br />THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.</p>
<p><br />The Government has a requirement to procure ALQ-240(V) 1 Electronic Support Measures (ESM) Shop Replaceable Assemblies (SRAs) and Bit/Piece Parts that will serve as material lay-in to support the standup of the ALQ-240(V) 1 ESM Depot &amp; Intermediate Maintenance Sites. The material lay-in for the ALQ-240(V)1 ESM Depot will be awarded under N00164-13-G-WT15-0009. The material lay-in for the ALQ-240(V)1 ESM Intermediate Maintenance Sites will be awarded under N00164-15-G-WS82-0002. However, the total amount of material needed for both the Depot &amp; Intermediate Sites will be solicited under one solicitation, with the splitting of the material for the Depot &amp; Intermediate Sites under their respective Job Orders.</p>
<p>This requirement will be negotiated on a sole-source basis in accordance with the statutory authority cited under 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, with Northrop Grumman Corporation-Electronic Systems (NGSC-ES), 7323 Aviation Boulevard, Linthicum, Maryland, 21090, with NGSC being the Design and Manufacturing Source for the ALQ-240(V)1 ESM. The basis for restricting competition is that the Government does not possess the data rights necessary to manufacture the subject SRAs and Bit/Piece Parts, and the effort to design, manufacture, generate acceptance test procedures, and perform laboratory, ground, and flight testing to obtain flight qualification is cost-prohibitive.</p>
<p>The request for proposal will be issued to NGSC-ES on or about 04 December 2015, with an anticipated contract award date of 9 September 2016. No solicitation will be available at FedBizOpps and no hard copies of the solicitation will be mailed.

<DESC>Background: A market survey was posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps) website on 22 October 2015 to solicit information from potential offerors with regard to delivering mobile command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence (C4I) solutions in support Department of Defense (DoD) customers and federal agencies at locations worldwide. Specifically, SPAWAR Systems Center Atlantic is seeking feedback on the acquisition strategy to include the structure of the contract, use of one or more of the authorities under Section 1331 of the Small Business Jobs Act, as well as comments on the draft performance work statement (PWS).  To date, we have only received feedback from one contractor with regard to this.
We are requesting industry (Large and Small businesses) provide input on the impacts of the different authorities available under Section 1331 considering the Mobile C4I draft PWS (see attached).
1. Partial Set-Asides of Multiple Award Contracts (13 CFR 125.2(e)(3))
2. Reserves of Multiple Award Contracts Awarded in Full and Open Competition (13 CFR 125.2(e)(4))
3. Set-aside of Orders Against Full and Open Multiple Award Contracts (13 CFR 125.2(e)(6))
If a partial set-aside approach is recommended, we request identification of the functional areas/categories of the PWS that should be designated for performance by small business concerns.  Additionally, provide us with any suggestions on the structure of the PWS (i.e. that may benefit both the customer and industry).
One of the many goals of SPAWAR Systems Center Atlantic Contracts is to reduce or eliminate the requirement for a market survey at the task order level thereby expediting the award process. We may be able to accomplish this by relying upon an alternative methodology set forth in Section 1331 while still satisfying the small business goals.
All responses shall be submitted to ssclant_future_cntr@navy.mil.  Submissions are due by 4:00 p.m. (EDT) on 11 December 2015.
This Special Notice is for information gathering and planning purposes only, and should not be construed as a Request for Proposal (RFP) or solicitation of an offer. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Special Notice or otherwise pay for the information solicited. Submission of vendor information constitutes consent to publication of that information in SSC-LANT documentation.

<DESC>Provisions set forth by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a)(2) (ii) (A) authorizes the use of brand name only supplies in solicitations/contracts when supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a contract requiring the use of highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. As such, for the purposes described hereunder and in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, coupled with the Authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), the Army Corps of Engineers, Norfolk District intends to issue a competitive solicitation that will include brand name only items. Specifically, the winning contractor will be required to purchase the following brand name systems/equipment in support of the Construction of FY15 Hospital Addition/Central Utility Plant Replacement, Joint Base Langley-Eustis, Hampton, VA contract:
<p>Standard Lock Assembly - Best Locks and Cores<br />Nurse Call - Rauland IV Nurse Call System<br />Public Announcement System - Ambassador Enterprises and Nexia Biamp<br />Fire Alarm - Monaco Enterprises, Inc.<br />Mass Notification Receiver - Wheellock/SAFE PATH 4, Model #SPS40S<br />Access Control - Continental Access<br />Automated Logic - Web CTRL server version 6.0</p>
<p>The use of the original manufacturer of materials and components is required to prevent issues of system functionality and extensive additional costs. The use of any other manufacturer would cause a need to replace in essence complete parts and accessories thus creating complete new systems. Therefore, the future contract will need to use brand name descriptions peculiar to one manufacturer for a specific system with whom a turn-key solution can be provided meeting all government requirements.</p>
<p>The government has already developed plans and specifications for the Hospital Addition/Central Utility Plant Replacement and intends to utilize competitive procedures for the future solicitation/contract of the construction project requiring the brand name only components. The future solicitation will be numbered as W91236-16-R-0005 and competed unrestricted. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for the project is 236220 with a small business size in dollars of $36.5M.</p>
<p>Interested parties may identify their interest and submit clearly articulated product information. Product information lacking the particular features that do not meet, or cannot be modified to meet, this agency's needs cannot be considered. Interested firms may submit their interest and information from the date of this notice until 2:00p.m. EST on 18 December 2015 via email to Joy Wright at joy.w.wright@usace.army.mil with a copy furnished to Tramaine Sims at tramaine.j.sims@usace.army.mil. Any electronically submitted files by Email CANNOT EXCEED this Agency's size limit of 20MB (includes email and its attachment); files exceeding this size will be denied access to our email inbox. It is the responsibility of your firm to determine the size of its electronic file.</p>
<p>The posting of this Notice satisfies the provisions set forth at Subpart 5.2 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.</p>

(End of Clause)
852.211-70  SERVICE DATA MANUALS (NOV 1984)
  (a) The successful bidder will supply operation/maintenance (service data) manuals with each piece of equipment in the quantity specified in the solicitation and resulting purchase order. As a minimum, the manual(s) shall be bound and equivalent to the manual(s) provided the manufacturer's designated field service representative as well as comply with all the requirements in paragraphs (b) through (i) of this clause. Sections, headings and section sequence identified in (b) through (i) of this clause are typical and may vary between manufacturers. Variances in the sections, headings and section sequence, however, do not relieve the manufacturer of his/her responsibility in supplying the technical data called for therein.
  (b) Title Page and Front Matter. The title page shall include the equipment nomenclature, model number, effective date of the manual and the manufacturer's name and address. If the manual applies to a particular version of the equipment only, the title page shall also list that equipment's serial number. Front matter shall consist of the Table of Contents, List of Tables, List of Illustrations and a frontispiece (photograph or line drawing) depicting the equipment.
  (c) Section I, General Description. This section shall provide a generalized description of the equipment or devices and shall describe its purpose or intended use.

Notes, cautions and warnings shall be set off from the text body so they may easily be recognizable and will draw the attention of the reader. Illustrations should be used wherever possible depicting equipment connections for test, calibration, patient monitoring and measurements. For large, complex and/or highly versatile equipment capable of many operating modes and in other instances where the Operation Section is quite large, operational information may be bound separately in the form of an Operators Manual. The providing of a separate Operators manual does not relieve the supplier of his responsibility for providing the minimum acceptable maintenance data specified herein. When applicable, flow charts and narrative descriptions of software shall be provided. If programming is either built-in and/or user modifiable, a complete software listing shall be supplied. Equipment items with software packages shall also include diagnostic routines and sample outputs.

  (f) Section IV, Principles of Operation. This section shall describe in narrative form the principles of operation of the equipment. Circuitry shall be discussed in sufficient detail to be understood by technicians and engineers who possess a working knowledge of electronics and a general familiarity with the overall application of the devices. The circuit descriptions should start at the overall equipment level and proceed to more detailed circuit descriptions. The overall description shall be keyed to a functional block diagram of the equipment. Circuit descriptions shall be keyed to schematic diagrams discussed in paragraph (i) below. It is recommended that for complex or special circuits, simplified schematics should be included in this section.
  (g) Section V, Maintenance. The maintenance section shall contain a list of recommended test equipment, special tools, preventive maintenance instructions and corrective information. The list of test equipment shall be that recommended by the manufacturer and shall be designated by manufacturer and model number.

L. 113-235), Government agencies are not permitted to use funds appropriated (or otherwise made available) <br />under that or any other Act for contracts with an entity that requires employees or <br />subcontractors of such entity seeking to report fraud, waste, or abuse to sign internal <br />confidentiality agreements or statements prohibiting or otherwise restricting such <br />employees or subcontractors from lawfully reporting such waste, fraud, or abuse to a <br />designated investigative or law enforcement representative of a Federal department or <br />agency authorized to receive such information. <br />(b) The prohibition in paragraph (a) of this provision does not contravene <br />requirements applicable to Standard Form 312, Form 4414, or any other form issued by <br />a Federal department or agency governing the nondisclosure of classified information. <br />(c) Representation. By submission of its offer, the Offeror represents that it does not <br />require employees or subcontractors of such entity seeking to report fraud, waste, or <br />abuse to sign internal confidentiality agreements or statements prohibiting or otherwise restricting such employees or subcontractors from lawfully reporting such waste, fraud, or abuse to a designated investigative or law enforcement representative of a Federal <br />department or agency authorized to receive such information. <br />(End of provision)</p>
<p>52.209-5 CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (APR 2010)<br />(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-<br />(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-<br />(A) Are [ ] are not [ ] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(B) Have [ ] have not [ ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have," the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation);<br />(C) Are [ ] are not [ ] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in subdivision (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and<br />(D) Have [ ], have not [ ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(2) Examples.<br />(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c) (1) (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <BR> <BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.

(ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. <BR> <BR>(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. <BR> <BR>(a) The Contractor shall comply with the following Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clauses, which are incorporated in this contract by reference, to implement provisions of law or Executive orders applicable to acquisitions of commercial items: (1) 52.222-50, Combating Trafficking in Persons (FEB 2009) (22 U.S.C. 7104(g)).

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

(Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.]<br />(1) [_] Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1).

(Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to the SAM database to be eligible for award.)<br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).<br />(2) The TIN may be used by the government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)).

Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00).

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) Orlando intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, a contract for the procurement of one CrewView Visual Display System (VDS) from Flight Safety International for inclusion in the CH-47F Transportable Flight Proficiency Simulator (TFPS) number 23 under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  CH-47F TFPS 23 is being constructed at Naval Air Warfare Systems Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) Simulation Division.  
The CH-47F is a transportable simulator and all components are required to be ruggedized to survive movement of the simulator.
  The VDS is one such component. Currently, the CrewView VDS is the only commercially available display system that will meet the Government requirements. The Crewview VDS is solely manufactured and distributed by Flight Safety International (FSI).
The CrewView VDS provides the Out-the-Window (OTW) view to pilots training.  The CrewView VDS is a ruggedized wide collimated display system with a field-of-view of 180 degrees horizontally and 50 degrees vertically.  The VDS is comprised of 4 ruggedized mirror segments and their support structure, a back projection screen, 9 projectors with mounting hardware, 2 chin window displays, networking equipment and associated wiring.  The VDS has an auto-alignment capability and uses enhanced night vision goggle stimulation for NVG training.
  The VDS packages into and is completely contained within the enclosure when the TFPS is being transported.
FAR Part 12.101(b) states that agencies shall acquire commercial items or non-developmental items when they are available to meet the needs of the agency. Since the Flight Safetys CrewView VDS is the only commercial item that is compatible with the CH-47F TFPS and the Government has neither the intellectual property rights nor data necessary to provide to another contractor to develop a compatible VDS, this acquisition will be sole source.
This synopsis is not a request for competitive proposals. It is a notice that outlines the Governments intent to contract on a sole source basis with Flight Safety International.
 Interested sources desiring to contest this synopsis may do so by asserting its supportable rationale via email to Brandon Haas, Brandon.Haas@navy.mil in an electronic format that is compatible with Word 2010, no later than 18 December 2015 at 1300 EST. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government. All information shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government.  No solicitation document is available. If no written contest to this synopsis is received, a Justification and Approval (J and A) in accordance with FAR Part 6.303 based on the rationale provided above will be initiated.  If conducted as sole source procurement with Flight Safety International, no further synopsis will be provided.

Any contractor not already doing business in Korea as a local source, must submit adequate verification in its initial proposal or quote, that it has the requisite authorization and capacity to compete for the requirement as a local source, and to perform the contract as a local source. If an initial proposal does not fully demonstrate this authorization and capacity, it will not be further considered for award.

L. 113-235), Government agencies are not permitted to use funds appropriated (or otherwise made available) under that or any other Act for contracts with an entity that requires employees or subcontractors of such entity seeking to report fraud, waste, or abuse to sign internal confidentiality agreements or statements prohibiting or otherwise restricting such employees or subcontractors from lawfully reporting such waste, fraud, or abuse to a designated investigative or law enforcement representative of a Federal department or agency authorized to receive such information.
(b) The prohibition in paragraph (a) of this provision does not contravene requirements applicable to Standard Form 312, Form 4414, or any other form issued by a Federal department or agency governing the nondisclosure of classified information.
(c) Representation. By submission of its offer, the Offeror represents that it does not require employees or subcontractors of such entity seeking to report fraud, waste, or abuse to sign internal confidentiality agreements or statements prohibiting or otherwise restricting such employees or subcontractors from lawfully reporting such waste, fraud, or abuse to a designated investigative or law enforcement representative of a Federal department or agency authorized to receive such information. <BR> <BR>Invoicing Procedures - Electronic Submission of Payment Requests (a)	Definitions.

(b)	Electronic Payment Requests.  Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this clause, the contractor shall submit payment requests in electronic form.

(2)	The contractor MUST NOT: a.	Submit an invoice that exceeds the size limit of 16 megabytes (approximately 400-500 pages).

Inquiries regarding invoices should be e-mailed to BLSInvoiceInquiry@dol.gov.  The relevant invoice must be attached to the inquiry e-mail and the subject line of the e-mail must state ?INQUIRY,? followed by the information described in paragraph (1) d. above.

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--</p>
<p>(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;</p>
<p>(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>
<p>(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>
<p>(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>
<p>(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]</p>

<p>(2) [_] Outside the United States.</p>
<p>(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Labor Standards. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)

<p>(1) [_] Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1).

<p>(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies-<br />(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Labor Standards wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and<br />(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause.</p>
<p>(l) Taxpayer identification number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to the SAM database to be eligible for award.)</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer.  If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. 

Election of Forum.  After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protestor agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum.  If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.

The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<p>(vii) The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial, applies to this acquisition.</p>
<p>(viii) <strong>The provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items</strong>, applies.</p>
<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible quoter whose quote conforming to the solicitation is the lowest price technically acceptable quotation. Quotations will be evaluated in accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. Award will be made to the lowest priced technically acceptable offer. The Government will evaluate "Key Personnel" and "Past Performance" to determine if a quote is considered technically acceptable.</p>
<p><strong>Key Personnel</strong><br />Key personnel are defined as the quoter's proposed employees responsible for providing regular ASL Interpreting Services. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Quoters shall submit a one-page resume for all individuals proposed as key personnel.</span></strong> Interpreters shall have a minimum of three years continuous experience in performing similar interpreting services in a diverse office environment.</p>
<p>The Key Personnel factor will receive a rating of "acceptable" or "unacceptable" based on its entirety. In order to receive an "acceptable" rating, Quoters must demonstrate that all key personnel proposed have sufficient relevant experience to indicate they have the knowledge and capability to successfully perform their assigned roles. If proposed key personnel are replaced during the execution of this project, replacement personnel must have equal or better qualifications as those proposed and must be approved by the Contracting Officer before they perform work. (See 452.237-74 KEY PERSONNEL (FEB 1988.) Missing, incomplete, or ambiguous information could result in a rating of "unacceptable".</p>
<p><strong>Past Performance</strong><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Quoters must provide Past Performance references for at least three (3) projects for work performed by the Quoter within the last three years</span></strong>.

The past performance factor will receive a rating of "acceptable" or "unacceptable" based on its entirety. Past performance will be rated "unacceptable" if the contractor receives an unsatisfactory rating from references unless the offeror can demonstrate that adequate corrective actions were taken. In the case of an Offeror with no relevant performance history, or for whom no information on past performance is available, the Offeror will be evaluated as "acceptable" provided the Offeror certifies that additional past performance information is not available and provides an acceptable explanation as to why past performance information is not available.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>

<DESC><strong>To assist with any confusion any vendor may have regarding the mobile ultrasound service requirements, please read below.&nbsp; Please read carefully to ensure that submission of quotes are done properly and accurately. </strong>
<p><strong>It is estimated that it should take no more than an hour to run the necessary tests on one inmate. When the personnel come out to perform the services, the institution staff will arrange for him/her to perform anywhere between 8 to 25 sessions. (The personnel will have anywhere between 8 to 25 inmates during that time frame.) It is expected for them to perform these services 8 times a year. The schedule to perform services will be coordinated with the program staff at the institution. <br /><br />The exact type of ultrasound services needed to be performed were not specified, but the services would only require a small device that can be carried into the institution on a cart.<br /><br />The Schedule of Items/Contract Pricing and Schedule of Supplies/Services are the same. You are given the option to either use our form (Schedule of Supplies/Services) to submit your pricing or use your own as long as it is in the same basic format as ours. <br /><br />When calculating the requirement, do as follows. If your price is $100 then you would multiply it by the number of sessions/hours, which is 150 for the Base Year, which would equal $15,000 for that year. One session is defined as one hour. So for the Base Year, the personnel can expect to perform a maximum total of 150 sessions/hours at the institution.<br /><br />Also, please note that the institution wants the personnel to have a mobile ultrasound device that can be carried into the institution on a cart because the services will be performed inside the Medical facility of the institution.<br /><br />To allow time for review, I am extending the deadline for one week.&nbsp; The new deadline is set forth on next Friday, December 11, 2015 at 2pm CST.</strong></p>

Flow down required in accordance with paragraph (d) of FAR clause 52.247-64. <BR> <BR>The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>(a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. (d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. <BR> <BR>(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>(a) An agency protest may be filed with either: (1) The contracting officer, or (2) at a level above the contracting officer, with the appropriate agency Protest Decision Authority. See 64 FR 16,651 (April 6, 1999). (b) Agency protests filed with the Contracting Officer shall be sent to the following address: [Insert Contracting Officer name and Address] (c) Agency protests filed with the agency Protest Decision Authority shall be sent to the following address: [Insert appropriate Protest Decision Authority name and Address] (d) A complete copy of all agency protests, including all attachments, shall be served upon the Contract Law Division of the Office of the General Counsel within one day of filing a protest with either the Contracting Officer or the Protest Decision Authority. (e) Service upon the Contract Law Division shall be made as follows: U.S. Department of Commerce, Office of the General Counsel, Chief, Contract Law Division, Room 5893, Herbert C.

(f) Failure to comply with security processing requirements may result in termination of the contract or removal of contract employees from Department of Commerce facilities or denial of access to IT systems. (g) Access to National Security Information. Compliance with these requirements shall not be construed as providing a contract employee clearance to have access to national security information. (h) The contractor shall include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph, in all subcontracts. <BR> <BR>(a) Except as stated in paragraph (b) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (1) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (2) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ?I agree? click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ?click-wrap? or ?browse-wrap? agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (3) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.

<DESC>This combined synopsis/solicitation is being amended to answer the following questions:<br /><br /><br />QUESTION 1: Specification does not address the processor speed in section (2) of the requirement. The designed processors frequency was 2.3Ghz. There is a 1.8Ghz part that would meet the specifications as provided. Would your engineers accept the lower cost 1.8Ghz part?
<p><br />ANSWER 1: The required processor is an Intel Xeon E5-2600 v3 family. The actual clock speed is not important as long at the processor is in the Intel Xeon E5-2600 v3 family.</p>
<p><br />QUESTION 2: The term "Enterprise" should be added to section (5) to properly describe the hard drives.</p>
<p>ANSWER 2: Yes. Enterprise will be added to the Government Minimum Requirements, see updated attachment.</p>
<p><br />QUESTION 3: Section (6) calls out for "hard drives". There is a cost, performance and reliability components to this part. Please verify that the program does not need the Solid State Drives.</p>
<p>ANSWER 3: Solid state drives are not a requirement.</p>
<p><br />QUESTION 4: We provide a service to keep the hard drives in the event of a failure during the warranty period. This is not listed as desired on the requirements. Can you please verify that this is not desired?</p>
<p>ANSWER 4: This is not desired. Security regulations do not allow us to return the drives in the event of failure.</p>
<p><br />QUESTION 5: Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server version 6 license", we will install the OS to these servers or did this RFQ require the license only? Also, there are several options of Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server Version 6 currently available which will all differ in pricing depending on which option and subscription you use. Which options would you prefer to be quoted on?</p>
<p>ANSWER 5: The requirement is for a Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server Version 6 OS license with the standard option. The vendor may install the OS, but the vendor is not required to do so.</p>
<p><br />QUESTION 6: What is the requested amount of CPU's? Although the RFQ mentions 8 cores, the requirement does not give us a specific processor amount.</p>
<p>ANSWER 6: The requirement is an Intel Xeon E5-2600 v3 family processor or processors with a minimum of 8 cores. This can be achieved with one processor or two processors. The number of processor is not part of the specification. A single processor with 8 cores from the Intel Xeon E5-2600 v3 family satisfies the requirement. Two processors with a total of 12 cores from the Intel Xeon E5-2600 v3 family also satisfies the requirement.</p>
<p>QUESTION 7: Do you want Red Hat Linux OS AS Version 6 - they come in subscription we purchase from our vendor in a 1-YR Subscription OR a 3-YR Subscription?</p>
<p>ANSWER 7: The requirement is for Red Hat Linux Enterprise OS server Version 6 standard option with at least a one year license. A three year subscription is acceptable but not required.</p>
<p><br />QUESTION 8: The RFQ calls for At least 2 dual open 10GBase SFP+ Ethernet ports. This could be read as Qty 2 Dual port 10GB SFP+ Ethernet cards (total of 4 ports And is this in addition to the 2 10GBase-T Ethernet ports specified in item (10)?</p>
<p>ANSWER 8: The requirement is for two 10GBase SFP+ Ethernet ports on the system. This can be achieved with a single card with dual 10GBase SFP+ Ethernet ports. This is in addition to the 2 10GBase-T Ethernet ports specified in item (10).</p>

(i) This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
(ii) The solicitation number is VA241-16-Q-0104 and the solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).
(iii) A statement that the solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-83.
(iv) This requirement is being issued as a SDVOSB set-aside.  The associated NAICS code is 541620 and small business size standard is $15 million.
(v) The Government intends to award a firm-fixed price award for bulk asbestos sampling of crawlspace dirt at the Boston VAMC Campuses.  The order will have a period of performance of Date of Government Award-01/31/2016.  Please see the attached Statement of Work for the full scope and deliverables.  Final pricing shall include all charges necessary to provide soil sampling for asbestos fibers.

With that being said, since the TEM ENV-004 analysis usage is unknown, the total estimated (250) units are not guaranteed and will be used on an "as-needed" basis.

Additional questions may be submitted to: Lori Moore, lori.e.moore.civ@mail.mil.  <br>  <br> 1.	QUESTION: Will offerors be required to have in place an Associate Contractor Agreement with the aircraft, avionics, or powerplant OEMs at the time of proposal submission or at any time during contract performance? <br>  <br>         ANSWER:  The government requires that the OEMs (Rockwell Collins and Boeing) provide field service representative (FSR) support to ensure that requisite experts are on hand to address any interface issues with the MWO and the aircraft or aircraft systems/subsystems when the aircraft is complete with PIP installs.  <br>  <br> 2.	QUESTION: I noticed that some of the questions reference a SOW document.  I do not see one on FBO.  Is there one available for us to review?  Also, is there a link to any of the Industry Day Documents?   <br>   <br>         ANSWER:  A previous modification/amendment to the solicitation addressed the first part of the question, but not the last part. Therefore, the link for the Industry Day Documents is as follows: https://conference.redstone.army.mil/ <br>  <br> THIS 2ND MODIFICATION TO THE SYNOPSIS IS ISSUED TO ADDRESS SEVERAL QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS IN REFERENCE TO SOLICITATION W58RGZ-15-R-0088.

QUESTION 1(a):  Can you provide a timeframe of when the solicitation will be issued?  <br>    <br>          QUESTION 1(b): Understanding that schedules are subject to change for a number of reasons, can the Government provide its best estimate of the timing of the release of the performance work statement, MWOs, draft solicitation documents and final solicitation?  <br>    <br>  ANSWER:  The solicitation was issued to the Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) website on May 20, 2015.    <br>          <br>  2.	QUESTION 2(a):  I noticed that some of the questions reference a SOW document.  I do not see one on FBO.  Is there one available for us to review?

There is not a SOW on the FBO announcement and I have made numerous searches on the ASFI (using the FBO solicitation number, the Agency, the Office, the Location, and the Name of the solicitation) and each returns no results.  Where might I find the draft SOW?  <br>    <br>  ANSWER:  The solicitation was issued and posted along with the SOW and referenced attachments to the ASFI website.   <br>                                                  <br>  3.	QUESTION:  The synopsis states that offerors shall be capable of furnishing all personnel, labor, management, materials (to include office supplies and consumables) and data, parts supplies, transportation, IT equipment, safety equipment and general equipment, except GFE. Is it the Government's expectation that the maintenance, modification, scheduling and logistics support will be performed in Government hangar facilities or in the contractor's facilities?   <br>    <br>  ANSWER:  The offeror will be required to provide facilities. The place of performance for the Product Improvement Program will occur at the offeror's facility.  <br>    <br>    <br>    <br>  THIS MODIFICATION TO THE SYNOPSIS IS ISSUED TO ADDRESS SEVERAL QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS IN REFERENCE TO SOLICITATION W58RGZ-15-R-0088.

The solicitation is for DLA managed consumables, for the procurement of certain part numbered items that cross reference to National Stock Numbers (NSNs) identified below. The items will be solicited using Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 15 procedures. There are two approved sources of supply, R.H. Sheppard Co., Inc. (CAGE 78222) AND Oshkosh Defence, LLC (CAGE 75Q65); therefore, the acquisition will be limited to items manufactured by these companies. Because there is a limited number of manufacturing sources, the requirement is being procured with other than full and open competition in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source, or in this case a limited number of responsible sources, and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.

<DESC>Modification/Amendment to change Response Date&nbsp;from December 11, 2015 to December 14, 2015.<br /><br />This is a Notice of Intent, not a request for proposal. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to negotiate on an other than full and open competition bases with Becton, Dickinson and Company, 2350 Qume Drive, San Jose, CA, 95131 a service contract for various models of lasers that is specifically designed to use with BD Biosciences High Throughput Sampler Units and FACSAria Cell Sorters. All lasers models 1) Sapphire 488-100 Blue Lsr #640100, NO-SERIAL-2827, 2) COHR Compass Green 315M-150 Lsr, #640102, NO-SERIAL-2828, 3) LSR Red Laser, #337691, NO-SERIAL-2829, 4) Laser Violet 405-100, #647316, NO-SERIAL-2830, 5) Sapphire 488-100 Blue Lsr, #640100, NO-SERIAL-6024, 6) Laser Violet 405-100, #647316, NO-SERIAL-6026, 7) COHR Compass Green 315M-150 Lsr, #640102, NO-SERIAL-6025, and 8) LSR Red Laser 628-200, #337691, NO-SERIAL-6027 must be compatible with existing equipment and no substitutions are allowed. As the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) Becton, Dickinson and Company deems necessary to maintain the equipment in accordance with their required specifications without the lasers the above reference instruments will be rendered non-functional. There is no known lasers offered that will physically fit inside the instruments to provide the optimal signal strength and power to accommodate the functioning of the instrument. To use a different vendor for these lasers will cause the instruments to not be able to be calibrated to optimal specifications such that samples between experiments will not be able to be analyzed and compared. This would adversely affect the function of the lab and its mission. The place of performance is for a base year plus one (1) year option period (1/1/2016 - 12/31/2017). Place of delivery is Bethesda, Maryland 20892. The statutory authority for this sole source requirement is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 only one source available, no substitutions possible, and replacement parts must be compatible with existing equipment. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. All responsible sources that can provide these services may submit a response that will be considered. The response should include the certification from Becton, Dickinson and Company that you are authorized to obtain OEM parts to maintain the above reference equipment. All responses in writing, by email to Tonia Alexander at talexander@niaid.nih.gov, by 5:00 pm eastern standard time Monday, December 14, 2015. All responses received by the closing date of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.

Please Note: Paper copies of the solicitation will not be made available. Prospective offerors desiring to conduct business with the DOI are requested to be registered in the Systems for Awards Management (SAM) at www.sam.gov. This solicitation is comprised of two (2) projects being solicited together under a single contract; consequently, the solicitation reflects the combination of GLAC 152999B and GLAC 152999C.</p>
<p>The NAICS Code for this requirement is 236220 size standard $36.5 million.</p>
<p>Many Glacier Hotel Work Components GLAC 152999B and GLAC 152999C:</p>
<p>The Work (GLAC 152999 Component B and C) includes critical health and life safety upgrades to Annex 2, the lobby and South Bridge of Many Glacier Hotel. This is a re-solicitation of both GLAC 152999B and GLAC 152999C projects into one contract. The re-solicitation includes elimination of many previous Bid Options, the combination of two projects into one base contract, and slight reduction of work scope from the previous solicitation package.</p>
<p>Component B:<br />Includes critical health and life safety upgrades to Annex 2 of Many Glacier Hotel. Work includes , but is not limited to complete replacement of: fire suppression, fire alarm, plumbing, electrical, and exhaust and ventilation systems; structural upgrades for gravity and seismic capacity, new slab work, repair/replacement of deteriorated or compromised structural members, fire resistance upgrades to architectural systems, select ABAAS upgrades, localized hazardous material remediation, and the removal/re-installation or removal/installation of new architectural finishes associated with this work. Due to the historic nature of this building, there are salvage, storage and reinstallation requirements of historic components. The majority of the work is interior. There are approximately 41,000 gsf and 115 guest rooms in Annex 2.</p>
<p>Component C:<br />Includes critical health and life safety upgrades to Lobby and South Bridge of Many Glacier Hotel. Work includes, but is not limited to complete replacement of: fire suppression, fire alarm, plumbing, electrical, and exhaust and ventilation systems; structural upgrades for gravity and seismic capacity, new slab work, repair/replacement of deteriorated or compromised structural members, including seismic mitigation to a 5 story stone chimney, fire resistance upgrades to architectural systems, select ABAAS upgrades, localized hazardous material remediation, and the removal/re-installation or removal/installation of new architectural finishes associated with this work. Due to the historic nature of this building, there are salvage, storage and reinstallation requirements of historic components. The majority of the work is interior. The Lobby and South Bridge constitute approximately 32,000 gsf and include 27 guest rooms, 6 staff rooms, as well as public areas of the Lake and Lobby levels that will be closed for the duration of the work.</p>
<p>Project will be constructed under a single prime contract. The majority of the work shall be conducted between April 2016 and December 2016. The Contractor will return to the site approximately April 15, 2017 to continue minor remaining construction activities until June 2, 2017 when hotel operation begins and visitation arrives shortly thereafter. It is expected that all white box guest rooms, Heidi's Caf&eacute;, and the Hotel Gift Shop scope of work be completed by December 2016.</p>
<p><br />1.1 WORK UNDER OTHER CONTRACTS<br />General: Cooperate fully with separate contractors so work on those contracts may be carried out smoothly, without interfering with or delaying work under this Contract. Coordinate the Work of this Contract with work performed under separate contracts.<br /><br />A. Concurrent Work: Government will award both projects for the Annex II (GLAC 152999B), Lobby and South Bridge (GLAC 152999C) approximately late January/early February 2016 during the winter shutdown. The two construction projects will be conducted simultaneously.<br /><br />1. The Concessioner may have other projects running in other portions of the hotel, including, but not limited to, temporary renovations for relocated check-in for summer 2016, retail and snack bar area tenant finishes, Lobby room and specific guest room upgrades and overall maintenance activities. Contractor shall coordinate work with the Concessioner and their Contractors.<br /><br />2. The NPS will have a design/build project at the Lobby to furnish and install the helical stair. General Contractor shall coordinate access and construction activities as needed.<br /><br />3. The Contractor shall be responsible for the removal and storage (before construction) and the re-installation of all furniture and non-building equipment.</p>
<p>The estimated total price of both phases is between $10,000,000 - $13,000,000 including all labor, materials, equipment and expertise necessary to perform all operations required for the successful completion of the above named project.</p>
<p>Type of Procurement: It is anticipated that a negotiated firm-fixed price contract will be awarded requiring submission of both a technical and price proposal. The government will consider an offeror's technical capability in comparison to its price.</p>
<p>A pre-proposal meeting is scheduled for Monday December 14, 2015 at 1:00 pm at the Many Glacier Hotel. If weather does not allow an on-site pre-proposal meeting, an alternative meeting location will be determined and an Amendment to the Solicitation will be issued. RSVP John Chaney if you are planning on attending this pre-proposal meeting at: john_chaney@nps.gov<br />or Sharon Miner at: sharon_miner@nps.gov</p>

It is the policy of the government to provide maximum practicable opportunities in its acquisitions to small business, veteran-owned small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns. Such concerns must also have the maximum practicable opportunity to participate as subcontractors in the contracts awarded by any executive agency, consistent with efficient contract performance. All offerors are strongly encouraged to contact their local Small Business Administration Office, to post their need for qualified subcontractors at http://www.sba.gov .</p>

<DESC>The previous synopsis posted on 11 March 2015 was cancelled on 19 March 2015 and the following synopsis amendment is posted&nbsp;on&nbsp;25 March 2015.&nbsp;<br />
<p>This synopsis provides notice of the Government's intent to extend contract N00421-09-C-0102, Communication-Electronic (CE) Platforms, via FAR Clause 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services. The contractor is BAE Systems Technology Solutions &amp; Services at 520 Gaither Road Rockville, MD 20850. This is necessary for the continuance of <span style="COLOR: black; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri">contractor support services to the Special Communications Requirements (SCR) Division of the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) at St. Inigoes, MD while the follow-on contract is being completed. The contractor support services will include the rapid design, development, customization, manufacturing, fabrication, integration, test and evaluation, installation, certification, maintenance and upgrade, logistic, and life cycle support of new and/or existing CE Platforms, equipment/systems and subsystems. </span>This extension covers a period of performance of approximately six months that will run from 15 August 2015 to 14 February 2016. This extension is necessary as the current contract performance is scheduled to end on 14 August 2015. Due to the ongoing nature of the support services currently being performed under contract N00421-09-C-0102 and the need to continue these services with a minimal break in work; BAE is the only practical source for providing the necessary continuation of these services until award of a competitive follow-on contract. The incumbent contractor, BAE, currently has fully trained personnel and a fully developed management system in place for execution of the required work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Re-solicitation for the six month period would not only result in a break in service, but would incur excessive costs to the Government. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. However, responsible interested parties may submit information in which they identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider all information received by 9 April 2015 1600 EST. A determination by the Government not to compete this procurement extension based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government will not pay for any information received. No telephone responses will be accepted. Any questions shall be submitted to Carolyn Emmart, Code 2.5.1.3.9, via email at carolyn.emmart@navy.mil.</p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-language: EN-US">Per FAR 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." BAE is the sole source capable of providing these support services without creating an impact on the sponsor schedules, project schedules, operations and operational readiness that would be caused by a break in service. It is unrealistic, from a technical and contractual perspective, to expect any other potential source to provide continued services prior to the competitive contract being awarded. Because of the nature of this requirement and the impracticality and substantial costs the Government would incur and not recover through competition, this will be procured on a sole source basis.</span></p>

<DESC>Strategic Acquisition Center - Frederick (SAC-F), on behalf of the Department of Veterans Affairs, issued Solicitation No. VA119A-16-R-0288, on October 14, 2015 for contractor support to assist with the expansion Veteran Directed Home and Community Based Services (VD-HCBS) program to all Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (VAMC) to include development, implementation, and evaluations of a VD-HCBS Program for Veterans with Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBI).

It was the Government's intention to award one Firm-Fixed Priced contract.  Evaluations were conducted and selection was made in accordance with the guidelines provided in the FAR, VAAR, and solicitation.  

The NAICS code for this acquisition is 541618 with a small business size standard of $15,000,000.

This justification for a logical follow-on supports award of a task order for up to six additional months in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 16.505 (b)(2)(i)(c).<br />The current Period of Performance (PoP) on the contract expires 30 November 2015, all options and the option to extend services per FAR Clause 52.217-8 have been exercised. A task order with one three-month base period and three one-month options (1 December 2015 through 31 May 2016) is needed while the customer redefines the requirement and a new contract is awarded to prevent an interruption of services which would result in a negative mission impact in a contingency environment.
