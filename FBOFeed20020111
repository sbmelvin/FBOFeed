<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) John F. Kennedy Space Center (KSC) is releasing a request for proposal (RFP) to develop a study of the Nutation Behavior of Spinning Space Vehicles with On-board Liquid Propellant.  This study will identify and collect available flight and test data for spinning vehicles with onboard liquid propellants.  This data will be analyzed, correlated, and combined in a form that is useful for application to current and future spacecraft programs.  All results shall be presented in a final report at the completion of the study.  Background:  NASA and other organizations regularly encounter the issue of rapid nutation growth due to energy dissipation by liquids on spinning vehicles.  Of concern is the stability of spinning upper stages and of spacecraft that spin for part or all of their missions.  Several missions in the past have required last-minute hardware and/or operational changes to deal with rapid nutation divergences that were identified late in the program.  This condition may result in significant schedule impact to a mission.  The results of this study should serve as an important step toward early identification and correction of this situation.  The formal RFP will be available via e-mail in fifteen (15) days from the posted date of this synopsis to all interested parties that respond to this synopsis.  The RFP package will include all relevant information for proposal preparation including the evaluation criteria.  Interested and responsible parties responding to this synopsis shall submit a request to the Contracting Officer, Marco Pochy, pochyml@kscems.ksc.nasa.gov or fax to 321-867-8567 and shall provide the following in their request:  Solicitation Request for "NASA/KSC Nutation Study", Company Name and address, Point of Contact, Business size, phone number, fax number, and an e-mail address.  Based on the responses received as a result of this synopsis, the acquisition may be a total small business set-aside. Responses received after fifteen (15) days or without the required information noted above may be considered non-responsive to this synopsis. Oral communications will not be accepted in response to this notice.  All questions must be submitted in writing. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See note 26.  The NAICS Code is 5417.  An ombudsman has been appointed - See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>The Missile & Space Intelligence Center of the Defense Intelligence Agency is soliciting information and input from industry in development of its software program, called the Defense Intelligence Agency's Object Oriented Model of Intelligence Operations (DOMINO) for providing realistic intelligence support. The purpose is to seek input and information useful in defining a long-term evolutionary approach that allows DIA to improve the ability of all-source analysts to support war games and military training exercises. 
The objectives of this program are to:
Review how all-source analysts currently support war games and military training exercises
Document and recommend areas where analytical tools, such as models and simulations could improve the ability of the all-source analysts to support war games and military training exercises
Review the intelligence cycle and make recommendations as to which parts should be quantified further (quantify includes, but is not limited to, process modeling)
Recommend and implement technical solutions that meet documented requirements
Recommend and implement a sustainment and user support plan
Identify potential tool customers/users throughout the Intelligence Community
Recommend how the developed tools could be used in the area of direct M&S support to war games and military training exercises (including supporting the Joint Simulation System, JSIMS, and Joint Experimentation)
The Government envisions a four-phase development path.  The first phase is the development of a detailed Course of Action (COA) (4-8 months). The second phase is the development of prototype software (10-15 months). The third phase is testing and acceptance of the prototype software (10-15 months). The fourth phase is sustainment and user support (12-24 months). Results of the first phase will influence to a significant degree the scope and details of subsequent phases.  Interested parties are requested to review the detailed statement of objectives (SOO) located on MSIC's web page at (www.msic.dia.mil) listed under Current Contracting Activity.  There is additional information that is related to the SOO.  However, it is classified and you must request it by phone (256-313-7617), fax (256-313-7963), or email (diruswm@msic.dia.mil) to CPT Matt Russell.  You will be required to provide a CAGE code to verify clearances.  Some travel will be required primarily among DIA facilities in Washington D.C., the JSIMS Alliance complex in Orlando, FL., and the Contractor's site.  As appropriate, contractors shall be required to execute Non-disclosure Agreements.  Information requested should include an overall development plan, a rough order of magnitude cost for implementing the development plan, a critical path methodology, a general schedule for implementation, and a draft statement of work for each phase of the effort.  Draft scopes of work/methodologies/responses will be used by the Government to assess feasibility, technical solutions and acquisition strategy for proceeding on this program. This is a request for information only.  Submit questions via email to CPT Matt Russell at diruswm@msic.dia.mil.  Answers to questions will be posted on MSIC's Home page (www.msic.dia.mil).  A solicitation is not currently available nor does the Government commit to the issuance of one.  The Government assumes no liability for any cost incurred in responding to this announcement.   Please respond with information not later than 22 February 2002 to CPT Matt Russell via email diruswm@msic.dia.mil or facsimile 256-313-7963.  The Contracting Specialist for this effort is CPT Matt Russell at 256-313-7617.  The Contracting Officer for this effort is Mike Thomason at 256-313-7652.

The existing communication infrastructure has served the community well, however a leap in capability is required to meet the rapidly increasing demand for bandwidth and connectivity. A transformational, network-centric communication architecture that leverages commercial, DoD and National developments is required to address these emerging needs with an Initial Operational Capability (IOC) objective no later than FY10. Offeror(s) shall take into consideration the Program Decision Memorandum (PDM IV), 28 December 2001 and the Air Force Scientific Advisory Board Study titled Availability and Survivability of Militarily Relevant Commercial Space Systems. Documents provided upon request. This architecture should support the entire spectrum of end user information exchange (i.e. Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance [ISR] sensors, Theater Battle Management Core System(s) [TBMCS], forward observer using Joint Tactical Radio System [JTRS] etc.) across following mission areas:
(i) Protected Tactical Services:  Anti-jam, low probability of intercept (LPI) and low probability of detection (LPD) capability as a follow-on to the Milstar and Advanced EHF (AEHF) programs. (ii) Wideband Services:  Support for protected and non-protected tactical, broadcast, and fixed sites as a replacement or follow-on for Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS), Global Broadcast System (GBS), and Wideband Gapfiller Satellite (WGS). (iii) Protected Strategic Services: Anti-scintillation, anti-jam, low probability of intercept (LPI) and low probability of detection (LPD) capability for nuclear Command & Control (C2) world-wide as a follow-on to the Milstar, Interim-Polar and AEHF programs.

<DESC>GSA is issuing a refreshed solicitation effective Januray 2, 2002, electronically only.  The Schedule is entitled "FSC 71, Part II - Household and Quarters Furniture". This new Solicitation, 3FNH-F6-020002-B, entitled as shown above, has been issued to replace standing solicitation 3FNH-F6-990001-B.  Special Item Number (SIN) 71-296 for Leased Furniture and SIN 71-297 for Rental Furniture have been added.  SINs 71-202 Wall Units (wood w/ laminate) and 71-203 Loft Groups, are 100% small business set-aside.

Interested parties may access the solicitation at http://www.fedbizops.gov.  This site provides instructions for downloading the solicitation files.  Search using Solicitation Number 3FNH-F6-020002-B (include the dashes). 

The basic solicitation includes clauses, which must be completed and returned by all offerors.  Some of the changes made to the solicitation are: I-FSS-163 Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Evergreen):  This clause will allow the government to have three (3) five (5) year options to your contract, for a total of twenty years if performance is satisfactory.  The options are not guaranteed.  Some of the measurements of satisfactory performance will be such things as adequate sales, quality performance, and timely IFF payments.  One of the most important evaluative factors will be participation in the GSA Advantage! program.  None of the Evergreen options will be exercised unless your firm has posted its contract information to the GSA Advantage! website.  All offers received will have 6 months after award of a Federal Supply Schedule contract to submit their electronic catalog to GSA Advantage!.  Contractors may now be represented as 8(a) contractors, providing SBA confirms that the offeror is indeed an eligible 8(a) contractor.  These changes are intended to increase the teamwork that has led to greater customer satisfaction and use of the Federal Supply Schedules.  There are mutual benefits for both the contractor and the government, and it is expected to increase revenues to those contractors who earn the right to maintain a contract for the entire twenty-year period.  Contracting questions should be directed to the points of contact listed in the solicitation. 

The Federal Supply Schedule period is continuous.  Individual contract periods will begin on the date of award and will expire five years later (exclusive of any options or cancellations).  All contracts will be indefinite delivery-indefinite quantity contracts with $2500 guaranteed minimum for the contract period.  All contracts to be awarded include Industrial Funding provisions.  We actively solicit offers from 8(a) firms for the products/services found under this MAS solicitation.  All responsible sources may submit an offer, which will be considered.

<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Engineering and Support Center, Huntsville, Alabama in support of the U.S. Military Academy (USMA), NY, intends to privatize its electric distribution system.  This privatization does not include the electric commodity and does not supplant e xisting commodity contracts.  Privatization is the transfer of ownership, which includes operation & maintenance, repair, improvements, etc. of Army owned systems to a non-Federal entity, and the subsequent acquisition of the utility distribution services from the new owners of the systems.  The Government will retain liability of any pre-existing environmental conditional conditions.  The conveyance of the utility distribution systems is authorized and conducted under10 U.S.C. 2688.  The conveyance will tr ansfer all rights, title, and interest of the United States Government in and to the utility distribution system.  The conveyance will not include any real property.  The contract for the acquisition of utility distribution services will be for a term of 5 0 years.    USMA’s electric distribution system is a modern, well-maintained system. Due to the large number of cadets and support staff, upgrades are frequently completed to maintain and meet state of the art education.  The local utility company enters the property at 2 locations with 35,000 volts and is then transformed to 13,800 volts and 4,160 volts. The transformation is accomplished by one (1) regulator station, four (4) primary substations, more than three dozen secondary substations and numerous transformers t hat deliver the power to the final user.  There are over 547,339 linear feet of underground primary cable and 150,660 linear feet of underground secondary cable.  These cables reach their destination through 439 manholes and 410,475 linear feet of mostly c oncrete encased duct.  There are 148,818 linear feet of overhead primary cable and 37,986 linear feet of overhead secondary cable.  The overhead has more than 303 utility poles with associated hardware.  There are over 1,099 street light standards and pole s that are a combination of a series of street lighting and multiple volt lighting with over 581,700 linear feet of underground overhead cable.  Many of the street light poles are specially cast structures.  Transformers number more than 200 and all oil fi lled transformers are tested every three years for PCB’s and other contaminants.  Preventive maintenance is performed regularly on all primary and secondary switching and all 100+ substation relays are tested yearly.   All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.  The RFP will be available during the March 2002 timeframe electronically through the Internet at www.hnd.usace.army.mil/contract.  The North American Inductry Classific ation System (NAICS) for this procurement is 221122.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation, Notice of Intent.  The Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with BD Biosciences Immunocytometry for accessories for a FACsCalibur flow cytometer in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. The Laboratory of Human Bacterial Pathogenesis recently purchased a FACsCalibur flow cytometer (AKA Fluourescence Activated Cell Sorter, which is manufactured by BD Biosciences (Becton Dickinson).  This instrument was acquired for high-throughput screening of bacterial pathogen-white blood cell interactions and for the identification of surface proteins on both human white cells and bacteria.  The machine aspirates cell suspensions and funnels these through a very small glass flow cell.  The FACsCalibur has detectors that read green, orange, red, or blue light emitted from fluorescent dyes.  Proteins can be detected on individual cells using antibodies linked to these dyes.  The instrument detects size and fluorescence of single cells and then quantitates each parameter.  The instrument can sort cells of a given size or fluorescent color into sterile tubes for subsequent analysis.  At present all samples must be read individually and from single tubes. The LHBP routinely analyses up to 250-300 tubes per day with anticipated growth to over 500 per day.  The manufacturer (BD Biosciences) has recently developed a Multiwell AutoSampler that facilitates rapid and automated analysis of samples.  The AutoSampler can read 96 samples within an hour and is automated thereby saving significant time for the individual reading the samples. The additional Sorting Upgrade to the FACsCaliber will enable sorting of unactivated white cells from those that have ingested bacteria as well sorting of specific white cell populations and surface labeled bacteria. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, quotes are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is issued as a Notice of Intent (NOI-RML20001). The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 97-27. This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a Small Business Set-Aside.

<DESC>Feasibility of Recovering Erased Material from the 18 1/2 Minute Gap in the Nixon Tapes.  This is a two-step process consisting of: (1) Submission of Technical Capability, Proof-of-Concept Qualification Testing, and Evaluation and Discussion of Technical Proposals; and (2) Price Competition. The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) is seeking sources to assess the feasibility of recovering erased audio program material from an 18.5 minute segment of the original "Nixon tape" 342, without damaging the original tape in any way for the Nixon Presidential Materials Staff. -- Step (1), Technical capability, proof-of concept qualification testing, and evaluation and discussion of technical proposals.  Potential vendors who currently employ viable techniques for the recovery and processing of erased audio signals on 1/4 inch magnetic tape and who are capable of recovering erased audio recordings of speech are requested to submit capability information in response to this synopsis to: Contracting Officer, National Archives and Records Administration, Acquisition Services Division (NAA), Attn:  Marion Bass-Dyer, 8601 Adelphi Road, Suite 3360, College Park, MD 20470-6100.  Capability information includes but is not limited to business size, professional experience, past performance, personnel resources, and details about the vendors' methodology, technical approach, the equipment the vendor proposes to use, terms and conditions and the facility where the work will be done. Technical Proof-of-Concept Qualification Testing is organized into three proof-of-concept tests phases. Each of the three test phases will consist of a test tape to be recovered, each tape in the sequence being progressively more representative of the original recording. Each test, in order, must be successfully completed at NO COST to the Government. Vendors will be required to recover audio tones and/or intelligible speech on a test tape and return the test tape, undamaged in any way, along with the recording of recovered audio, before the next test in the sequence will be initiated. For information, the test protocol will consist of a sequence of three test tapes recorded with signals and conversation known only to the NARA evaluation team.  Each succeeding 1/4 inch test tape will more closely simulate the original recording in terms of signal levels, types of signals, type of tape, etc.  After recording the test signals the tapes will be "erased" in the normal fashion on a properly operating recorder. Vendors will have to recover all information recorded on the test tapes without any evidence of damage to the test tape or the signal recorded on it.  Identical test tapes will be provided to each candidate.  The overall goal of this effort is recovery of intelligible speech on tape 342, comparable or equal to the quality of speech recorded before or after the "gap", not just speech like patterns or an indication that there was recorded material in the gap.  (Note:  This effort is not directed at traditional forensic investigation of the tape to determine authenticity, age, erasure status, etc.  Those factors are not in question).  The goal is recovery of intelligible speech.  The characteristics of the three test tapes are: Test Tape 1 - Audio tones and speech recorded on 1.5 mil tape at -10dbu level at 3.75 inches per second tape speed on a contemporary tape recorder.  The test recording will be "erased" in a normal manner on the same recorder. Vendors will be told only that the tape contained, before it was erased, some audio tones and some spoken word conversation similar to that on the original tape sections that still exist.  Vendors will be required to recover the test tones and the spoken word conversation to a level such that the tones would be correctly identified (frequency, relative amplitude, etc.) and the spoken words would be intelligible.  The recovery effort must cause no physical damage to the tape or reduction or alteration of the s

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items, prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.    The acquisition will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.5 to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions. This synopsis/ solicitation includes all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through FAR 97-27.  This solicitation is set aside for small businesses. The North American Industry Classification (NAIC) code is RFQ-NCI-20014-NQ and the business size standard is $5.0.  BACKGROUND: The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), Office of the Associate Director and the Cancer Statistics Branch, within the Surveillance Research Program (SRP); (1) plans, directs, coordinates and evaluates a program of cancer surveillance involving the collection and analysis of pertinent data in order to answer key questions about cancer incidence, morbidity, mortality, and cancer-related health status in diverse regions and in general and specific populations of the United States defined by sociodemographic measures; (2) evaluates a program of integrated, comprehensive, multiple population-based reporting systems and coordinates its cancer surveillance activities with other divisions, institutes, federal and state agencies, national and international health organizations, and public and private organizations; (3) provides leadership in developing statistical innovations appropriate for analyzing trends in cancer incidence, morbidity, mortality, and survival, for developing new cancer progress measures, and for evaluating the impact of cancer control interventions, geographic, social, behavioral, genetic, and health care delivery factors on the cancer burden; (4) provides planning and technical assistance, and conducts methodologic research on issues related to the design and analysis of randomized and nonrandomized studies for evaluating program interventions to reduce the cancer burden; (5) represents the program area in management and scientific decision-making within the Institute and other organizations involved in cancer surveillance; (6) develops applications of innovative information technology for dissemination of research results, for implementation of cancer surveillance systems, and for computer systems support of the Division?s research and administrative activities; (7) develops and participates in trans-National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), and private/public initiatives in areas relating to program responsibilities, including advancement of the science of cancer surveillance; and (8) meets with investigators and the relevant scientific community to exchange information, evaluate research trends and support extramural research.
REQUIREMENT: The purpose of this requisition is to obtain services related to organizing centralized file systems for both the Office of the Associate Director and the Cancer Statistics Branch, within the Surveillance Research Program (SRP).  Due to numerous reorganizations in past years, staff turnover, the current systems within the 2 branches are no longer effective/efficient.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be requir

The cost of moving, alterations, telecommunications relocation, etc., will be considerations in determining the best opportunity for the government. 

Unique Requirements: Prospective buildings must present a dignified and professional appearance and have a 100 foot set back from the street and a 100 foot set back from surface parking.  However, if a site cannot accommodate the 100-foot set back requirement but is otherwise acceptable, other security measures, e.g., concrete barriers, fence, blast film, etc., may be considered to mitigate the situation.  The office and related space must be contiguous and on one floor, second floor or higher, and not divided by a public corridor.  If the proposed lease space is on the fifth floor or higher then the entire building must be sprinkled.  Buildings will be ADA compliant, and asbestos abated.  DEA requires secured parking for its fleet of 59 official vehicles with the ability to increase by another 15 vehicles during the term of the lease.  The preferred form of secured parking is inside, on-site parking; i.e., basement garage or attached garage, where access is limited to, and controlled by DEA.  Where such parking is not available, DEA may accept outside parking, provided it is on-site and can be secured be means of a wall or fence with an electrically controlled gate access.  The wall or fence may be up to ten foot high to prevent access to the parking area.  Building and parking must be accessible to government personnel 24 hours per day, seven days per week.  The building and on-site parking must be open for business between the hours of 7:00 am to 6:30 pm, M-F, except federally recognized holidays.  DEA may not be located near residential areas, daycare centers, and schools.  A variety of affordably priced carryout and dine-in restaurants shall be located within six hundred feet.  Other employee services, such as retail shops, cleaners, banks, etc., shall be located within one thousand feet.  The Government's Buyer's Broker will ask for and receive a real estate commission of 4% on the Gross Rent from the successful lessor.

Location: Within the area approximately bounded by: the Trinity River to the north and west; the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Rail Road to the east and the Union Pacific Rail Road to the south.

Lease Term: Ten-year lease, five years firm.

Expressions of Interest Should be Made as soon as Possible and Include the Following: 1)Building's name and address; 2)Rentable and Usable square feet and rental rate per Rentable square foot; 3)Method of measurement used to determine rentable square feet; 4)Common Area Factor(s) for available space; 5)Operating Costs and Tenant Improvement Allowance paid by Lessor; 6)Name, address and telephone number of individual to be contacted , 7)Evidence of authority to represent the owner and 8) Any other considerations that would be beneficial to the Government.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The combined synopsis/solicitation number is SP4700-02-T-0014, and is issued for a Request for Quote (RFQ).  This announcement and its incorporated clauses and provisions are in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 97-27.  This request is to procure a commercial off the shelf (COTS) software product that will facilitate the Defense Commissary Agencys (DeCA) capability to utilize the Internet as a communications medium to both send and receive Electronic Data Interchange (EDI).  DeCA performs transactions with approximately 150 trading partners.  The COTS package must be capable of supporting DeCAs vendors incrementally or in its entirety.  If the COTS solution is purchased in increments, contractual provisions must allow additional vendor licenses to be purchased as DeCAs needs dictate.  The COTS package and all updates will be mailed by priority US mail to DeCA.  The desired delivery date is 31 January 2002.  A detailed Statement of Work (SOW) is included below.  The following FARs apply to this combined synopsis/solicitation: FAR 52.212-1, FAR 52.212-2, FAR 52.212-3, FAR 52.212-4, and FAR 52.212-5.  All RFQs are to be submitted to the POC no later than close of business, 22 January 2001.  The POC for this announcement is Mr. William Hilliard, facsimile: (703) 767-1130, e-mail:  william_hilliard@hq.dla.mil.  STATEMENT OF WORK          1. DELIVERY ORDER TITLE:  Internet Electronic Data Interchange (EDIINT) Software.     2. BACKGROUND:  The Defense Commissary Agency, a retail grocery store for Armed Service Members and retirees, has been a member of the  Uniform Code Council  since the mid 1990s.  As a member, DeCA actively participates in the refinement of the Uniform Communication Standards (UCS).  UCS is the international standards body that sets implementation guidelines for EDI and a member organization of the UCC.  DeCA currently uses the UCS Bisynchronous communications protocol to transmit and receive EDI data from 125 vendors and distributors.   Averaging 80,000 transactions per month, the data contained in the transmission is used to order and receive retail goods, transmit sale prices and advise vendors of cataloging status.  Effective in the near future, the UCS Internet Messaging Standard will replace the current IMB 3780 Bisynchronous Standard as the standard of choice for direct communications.  The Defense Commissary Agency, as a participating member of the Uniform Code Council, must migrate from its current bisynchronous transport method to the new transport method.     3. OBJECTIVE:  The objective of this Statement of Work (SOW) is to procure a commercial off the shelf (COTS) software product that will facilitate DeCAs capability to utilize the Internet as a communications medium to both send and receive EDI.  DeCA trades transactions with approximately 150 trading partners.  The COTS package must be capable of supporting DeCA?s vendors incrementally or in its entirety.  If the COTS solution is purchased in increments, contractual provisions must allow additional vendor licenses to be purchased as DeCA needs dictate.     4. PURPOSE:  The purpose of this Statement of Work (SOW) is to describe the software and maintenance requirements needed to satisfy the Defense Commissary Agencys electronic commerce requirement for EDIINT (Electronic Data Interchange Internet) software.     5. SPECIFICATIONS:  To ensure that different software vendors products meet the AS1 and AS2 standards, and that the individual companys products interoperate and communicate successfully with each other, the Uniform Code Council and Commerce Net sponsored several vendor conformance validation tests.

<DESC>The FAA Next Generation Air/Ground (A/G) Communications Team releases the NEXCOM System Requirements Document (SRD), FAA-E-2958, Rev 0.0, dated January 10, 2002 and introduces the draft Minimum Threshold Document (MTD).  NEXCOM continues as a long-term program, which will be incrementally phased into full-scale operation over a number of years.  The purpose of this release is to provide early information to potential ground system and avionics vendors pertinent to the overall aspects of the NEXCOM program.  The FAA plans to discuss these documents along with other programmatic information during Industry Day II, Jan 22- 25, 2002 with those vendors whose reservations have been confirmed by the FAA NEXCOM Program Office. <P> The final SRD has been updated based upon a review of comments previously submitted by interested parties. <P> The MTD describes in detail the full set of requirements (based upon the SRD) to design and build the HW and SW components of the NEXCOM System Engineering Design Model (EDM) for the Rapid Preliminary Development Effort (RPDE).  The MTD is a subset of SRD requirements.  The EDM will be used during the Full Scale Development Program (FSDP) technical evaluation process to demonstrate and verify vendor understanding of basic VDL Mode 3 technology.   The SRD is provided for information.  Limited comments concerning the draft MTD should be presented to the FAA at the scheduled one-on-ones during Industry Day II; however, formal written comments can be submitted through the period of January 11 to February 8, 2002.  Send written comments to Guo-Yuan.ctr.Wang @faa.gov.  Please use attached comment form. <P> Questions concerning the SRD and the draft MTD should be addressed to the FAA NEXCOM Program Contracting Officer, Mr. Matthew E. Asai, matt.asai@faa.gov.  The contracting officer will not respond to telephonic requests for information. <P>

<RESPDATE>011802
<ARCHDATE>02172002
<CONTACT>Toye Latimore, 703-428-2067
<DESC>NA This is a continuation of the questions in amendment 6.   45. Item 0070 quantity lists 1,600 yet just two lines below asks for 1,600 and for a quantity of 400.  Please clarify.  Does this answer apply to the option year as well? Response:  See item 54 on attachment 3 for 1,600 name badges.  The #400 corresponds to ribbons. 46. Item 0073 requests a unit price with a quantity of 17 (referring to 17 hours) to cover the number of hours a photographer is to be available.  But the description in attachment 3 also states that the film, proof sheets, delivery costs and 200 pictures are to be included in this per hour price as well.  If the Government or the MTMC were to reduce the number of hours or order a smaller quantity of hours (less than the listed 17) would this proportionally reduce the final number of finished product pictur es as well?  Are you asking for 11.76 finished pictures per associated unit price (per hour) or 200 finished pictures for each hour?  Does this apply to the option year as well? Response:  See Item 57 on attachment 3. 47. Item 0074 requests a unit price for a quantity of 30 units for 10x10 pipe and drape for 30 booths.  But the description on page 15 of 97 as well as on page 75 of 97 lists Booths and tables and 2 tables size (16x48).  Please clarify if the unit price is  supposed to be for booth pipe and drape only or for booth pipe and drape with tables?  Does this apply to the option year as well? Response:  0074 is for pipe and drape; See item 58 of attachment 3. 48. Item 0075 requests a unit price for 200 running feet of pipe and drape.  It is an industry standard that there is a base cost for material and labor and the additional feet although having some effect to the cost does not greatly change it. For example , 200 running feet could cost $300.00.  If you only ordered 150 running feet it could still cost $300.00 due to the labor and set-up costs.  If you ordered 225 running feet it could cost $315.00, but there is no way to break down the cost to a unit of a fo ot as requested without bidding an unbalanced line item and perhaps ultimately overcharging the government unnecessarily.  To prevent the unbalances may we bid a quantity as a lot and not as a foot?  Does this also apply to the option year?     Response:  Replace the word lot where feet, inches and decimal is stated throughout the CLIN structure sheet for the base and option year as well as on attachment 3. 49.  Item 0080 asks for a cost for rosters and lists attachment 3 as the reference but attachment 3 does not list or mention rosters.  Is this line item a mistake on the part of the government? Response:  See Paragraph 9.12 and item 64 of attachment 3. 50. Why are we asked to bid on rosters in item 0080 when we already bid on this exact same item in 0005?  Are there 1,600 rosters required or 3,200 rosters required? Response:  Item 0080 and 0005 are 2 different CLINS 51. We are very confused over item 0088 as the Government has asked us to bid on this item three times in three separate item numbers, yet it appears the government only wants one set of ribbons.  The ribbons appear in item 0005 (9.10), Item 0070 and now i n 0088.  What is the correct number of ribbons the Government is requested and which is the correct line item? Response:  0005 is Registration, 0088 refers to ribbons, See item 54 of attachment 3. 52. Does this apply to the option year as well? Response:  Yes, the same CLINS for the base year have option year CLINS 53. What is the purpose of item 1077 (200 running feet of pipe and drape) and item 1078 (100 running feet of pipe and drape)?  Is this a mistake on the part of the government and item 1078 should be the same as item 0076?  Is the Government requesting pipe  and drape or pipe and drape velour?  There are two very different items. Response:  CLIN 1077 and CLIN 1078 and CLIN 0076 are all separate CLINS and should be addressed and priced. 54. Paragraph 1.3 states th e majority of the work to be performed shall be

The average technician works a 40-hour week.  How many technicians does the Government propose be available at any one time in order to fulfill the Government's needs in a manner they require?  Are  the labor hours, lodging costs and food per diem to be included as a part of each equipment line? Response:  The government cannot advise Offerors as to how many technicians will be required. 3. On page 15, item 0071 and item 0072 ask for a unit price for parking.  However, in the description for both listed on page 15 the word, complimentary is listed. Please clarify if the Government expects the parking for these items to be complimentary or for there to be an associated unit price.  Also, respond to the same question for item 1072 and 1074 on page 31 and page 32. Response:  Parking should be complimentary for items 0071, 0072, 1072 and 1074. 4. On page 18 and page 35, the base year lists 90 separate items for the offeror to bid on and the option year lists 91 separate items for the offeror to bid on.  Why is there a difference between the two years when the contract appears to the mirror image  from one year to the next? Response:  See items 3 & 4 adding an additional CLINS. 5. On page 35 under the title Delivery Information it lists CLINS instead of Items as listed on the previous 34 pages.  What is the reasoning behind this?  Are the words CLIN and ITEM interchangeable?  Are they the same thing? Response:  Yes 6. Please explain the Inspection and Acceptance terms chart listed on pages 42-45 and what their purpose is and what meaning they have to an offeror? Response:  See FAR Part 46. 7. Page 47 lists the Table of Contents lists section 2.0 General as having 17 rela ted paragraphs yet it appears to have 20 related paragraphs as liste

<DESC>Environmental remediation services for a fixed price, IDIQ Environmental Multiple Award Contract (EMAC) involving remedial actions at environmentally contaminated sites at various locations in CA, AZ, NV, and NM.  The Government expects most of the work to be performed in Northern California.  This procurement is reserved for competition in the Section 8(a) program pursuant to the Small Business Act.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) applicable to this requirement is 562910, Environmental Remediation Services.  Responding 8(a) firms must have NAICS Code 562910 among their approved codes.  EFD Southwest intends to award two or more Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity 8(A) contracts.  The Government reserves the right to award only one contract as a result of this solicitation if at least two (2) qualifying proposals are not received.  Awards will be made using Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15 competitive negotiation procedures.  Contracts will be awarded to the responsible Small Business 8(a) firms whose proposals, conforming to the solicitation, offer the "Best Value" to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The contracts will be awarded for a base period of one year with four one-year option periods.  The Government intends to award one contract with the proposed Task Order 0001 and to award the remaining contracts with a minimum guarantee of $5,000.00 each.  However, the Government reserves the right not to award the proposed Task Order 0001 identified in this solicitation or to award it at a later date after award of the basic contract(s).  The minimum guarantee applies to the five-year term of the contract(s).  The aggregate value of delivery orders issued under the contract(s) will not exceed $20,000,000.  The number and dollar value of task orders awarded under each contract will depend upon the results of the task order competition conducted among the firms that receive contract awards.  Task orders will be competed on a firm fixed price basis among contract awardees in accordance with FAR 16.505(b).  Most of the work resulting from this solicitation will be performed in Northern California.  Typical work that may be performed under the resulting contract(s) include environmental remedial actions, removal actions, and remedial action systems operation and maintenance.  Remedial actions may include, but will not be limited to, capping landfills, pump-and-treat remediation, bioremediation, soil vapor extraction, natural attenuation, bioventing, air sparging, thermal treatment, phytoremediation, soil washing, and free product recovery.  Additional work includes: expedited and emergency response actions; pilot and treatability studies, and other related activities associated with returning sites to safe and acceptable levels of contamination.  The contaminants will include, but are not limited to, those identified and regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), Solid Waste Disposal Act (SWDA), and petroleum oils and lubricants (POL).  The contaminants included are predominately solvents, POL, metals, acids, bases, reactives, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and pesticides.  Contaminants may be present in soils, sediments, ground water, air, sludge, surface water, and man-made structures.  Contaminated sites may be landfills, hazardous waste treatment storage and disposal facilities, tanks, lagoons, fire fighting training areas, or other facilities.  Proposals will be evaluated based on the following evaluation factors:  Factor 1 - Past Performance, Factor 2 - Specialized Experience, Factor 3 - Engineering and Management Approach (This factor will include proposed Task Order 0001), and Factor 4 - Emergency Response Mobilization Plan are of equal importance to each other.  Factor 5 - Price (Price of the proposed Task Order 0001) is

<DESC>The Department of Transportation, Transportation Acquisition Service Center (TASC), Information Technology Omnibus Procurement, a Government Wide Agency Contract (GWAC) that has been granted authority to issue information technology (IT) service contracts for all public sector programs, is seeking to identify sources for Government-wide multiple award contracts for Expert Acquisition Support Service and Products.

The federal acquisition community (including both the information technology/CIO community and the procurement community) has been subject to significant reform initiatives over the past several years.  These reform measures ? such as the Clinger-Cohen Act, Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA), and Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (FASA), as well as the more recent Presidential and OMB directives to increase the use of performance-based contracting techniques have significantly changed the federal government?s approach to acquiring goods and services. 

Many federal agencies are having difficulties fully understanding and implementing these reform measures and streamlining practices and procedures.  There is a shortage of experience and expertise in effectively implementing acquisition reform measures. 

Finally, acquisition organizations across government are beset with a dwindling resource pool, both in terms of reduced funding (in many instances), reduced in-house expertise, and reduced staffing, both in technical and contractual support of the acquisition process.  This problem is exacerbated by the recent inclusion of inherently governmental functions on the FAIR Act inventory requiring Agencies to seek alternatives to existing acquisition management functions currently accomplished by in-house staff.  The legislative requirements, regulatory initiatives and dwindling resource pool all combine to require acquisition organizations to take innovative and aggressive steps to plan, control, and manage acquisitions.  This not only includes innovative ways to manage existing contracts, but also innovative ways to acquire new or additional resources.  Thus, there is a broad need for expert acquisition support services and products.  Therefore, TASC ITOP seeks to establish a broad suite of acquisition support capability that would provide such capability to any government agency in an efficient, cost effective manner.  

Therefore, and in accordance with the FAR 15.202 advisory multi-step process, TASC ITOP seeks statements of qualifications from firms who provide a broad suite of acquisition support services.  Firms may submit proposed technical concepts for satisfying this requirement, past performance information, and limited pricing information.  On the basis of responses received, as provided by the FAR, TASC will notify each respondent either that it will be invited to participate in the resultant acquisition or that it is unlikely to be a viable competitor.  

After such notice, an RFP will be issued to those firms invited to compete and any other firms who request to participate.

Documentation should be sent to U.S Department of Transpportation, 400 Seventh Street, S.W., Attn: Mona-Lisa Dunn, Room 5106, Washington, DC 20590.  Questions may be referred to Mona-Lisa Dunn at 202-366-5840 or e-mail at mona-lisa.dunn@tasc.dot.gov.  The purpose of this synopsis is to identify capable potential responsible sources only, does not constitute an RFP, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The Governmennt does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this notice or otherwise pay for any information solicited.  Responses shall be submitted in one original and two copies and are llimited to 3-7 pages.

<DESC>The 325th Contracting Squadron, Tyndall AFB FL, is in the process of determining the acquisition strategy for our Contracted Flight Training Service.  This is a request for information and not a formal solicitation.  Any formal solicitation will be announced separately.  The Air Force is interested in determining if sufficient and qualified small businesses are available and interested in providing the contemplated service.  The Air Force reserves the right to set-aside this entire acquisition for small business, however we invite both large and small businesses to address questions below.  The sole purpose of this synopsis is to develop and identify sources for a potential non-personal service contract that provides flight training services using turboprop or high performance piston engine type aircraft at Tyndall AFB, FL.  Training to be provided includes ground-controlled intercept target training, live-fire training, weapons system evaluations, and MAJCOM directed development test and evaluations at Tyndall AFB, FL. The contractor shall be required to provide approximately 3000 flight training hours annually.  The aircraft must be equipped to carry government furnished telemetry relay equipment.  Crews with specialized training and qualifications must fly the aircraft. Pilots must have a current Commercial Pilot License with Instrument Privileges, at least a minimum of one-year experience in fighter and USAF flight line operations and ground control intercept (GCI) procedures.  Maintenance Supervisor will have the following certification: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Air Frame and Propulsion (A&P) License and all other maintenance personnel must be certified in accordance with the applicable FAA directives for their respective duties.  The total period of performance will be 5 to 8 years, structured by a basic contract period and up to seven (7) option years.  We anticipate the contract type will be firm-fixed price, small business set-aside, under NAICS 611512.

<DESC>NA PRIVATIZATION OF THE ELECTRICAL DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM AT DETROIT ARSENAL, WARREN, MICHIGAN, SOL __________________ DUE _______: Point of Contact (POC) Ms. Patricia Horton (810) 574-5185. The U.S. Army Tank - Automotive and Armaments Command (TACOM) Acquisiti on Center, in conjunction with Detroit Arsenal (the Arsenal or the Installation), seeks to identify responsible potential sources and obtain information in regards to privatization of utility systems in accordance with 10 USC 2688, Utility Systems: Conveya nce Authority. TACOM’s Acquisition Center is seeking interest and information specifically for the potential privatization of the Arsenal’s electrical distribution system. The potential privatization action will include the transfer of ownership, operation  and maintenance, and the obligation to serve. The Army intends to retain ownership of all land and will grant easements and leases for access to land associated with the utility system. OBJECTIVE: Should privatization occur, the ownership of the Arsenal’s  electrical distribution system, operation and maintenance and the obligation to continue to provide utility service for an indefinite and ongoing period will transfer to a publicly or privately owned utility service provider. All responsibility for mainta ining reliable utility service, including such items as environmental compliance, maintenance costs, major system renovations, construction, equipment, manpower and overhead costs will become the utility service provider’s responsibility. It is intended th at the privatization will ultimately reduce the Army’s life-cycle costs for operating and maintaining the electrical distribution system and service. INSTALLATION DESCRIPTION: Detroit Arsenal is a part of the U.S. Army Tank - Automotive and Armaments Comma nd (TACOM) and is located adjacent to the community of Warren, Michigan, approximately 20 miles northeast of Detroit. The Installation is a compact military post presently consisting of approximately 20 buildings situated on 300 acres. SYSTEM DESCRIPTIONS:  The following is provided only to give an approximation of the size, scope and general description of the Arsenal’s electrical distribution system. Any numbers may be used for estimating purposes only. The Arsenal’s electrical distribution system is curre ntly owned by the U.S. Army and operated and maintained by the Installation’s Base Operating Contractor. The Arsenal purchases 100 percent of the Installation’s electric power requirements (roughly 47,000 Megawatt-Hours per year) from Detroit Edison. The A rsenal’s electrical distribution system includes the following major components: roughly 4.1 circuit-miles of 3-phase, 4.8 kV, underground cables (predominately 350 MCM and 500 MCM XLPE) in duct banks; 30 manholes; 44 medium-voltage transformers (both exte rior, oil-filled, conventional pad-mounted units and interior, dry-type, primary unit substations) ranging in size from 112.5 kVA to 2,500 kVA; and an exterior roadway/area lighting system with 80 pole-mounted lighting fixtures. PROCEDURES: This request to  interested parties is for gathering information and is a required component and systematic process to evaluate the interested parties under the U.S. Army’s utilities privatization program. In order to minimize costs both to potentially interested parties and the government, this notice is being issued to determine the interest and feasibility of proceeding with a formal request for proposals. Should insufficient credible interest be identified for a privatization action, it is highly likely that no formal solicitation will be issued. SHOULD INTEREST BE DETERMINED SUFFICIENT, A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS MAY BE FORTHCOMING. Small Business interests shall note the FAR Part 19 Standard Industrial Codes (SIC) and Size Standards (SS) for the utility systems id entified in this announcement. Some, all, or any combination of the following may apply. SIC/SS: __________, __________, __________, and _______

<SUBJECT>E--Privatization of Natural Gas Systems at Fort McPherson, Fort Gillem, Fort Stewart, and Hunter Army Airfield, Georgia
<SOLNBR>W31PRIVGAGAS
<RESPDATE>012502
<ARCHDATE>02242002
<CONTACT>Rebecca Vaughn, 256-895-1395
<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Engineering and Support Center, Huntsville seeks to identify potential responsible sources pursuant to re-issuing a solicitation for the privatization of the natural gas distribution systems at Fort McPherson, Fort Gillem, Fort Stewart, and H unter Army Airfield, Georgia.  Privatization is a process by which the Government sells its utility distribution systems to a private entity and contracts with that entity to provide the utility distribution service to the installation.  The U.S. Army Engi neering and Support Center, Huntsville will also consider recommendations from potential sources on methods to reduce proposal and contract costs, types of pricing arrangements, and any other ideas that may facilitate the privatization process.  Any result ing solicitation will not include the natural gas commodity and will not supplant existing commodity contracts.  Privatization is a process by which the Government sells its utility distribution systems to a private entity and contracts with that entity to  own, operate, maintain, and improve the utility in a manner similar to commercial systems.  SYNOPSIS-Fort McPherson:  The Fort McPherson natural gas system redistributes natural gas within the installation boundary to approximately 103 buildings.  The exi sting system contains  approximately 50,500 linear feet of natural gas pipe ranging in size from less than 2 inches to 6 inches in diameter.  The existing natural gas system consists primarily of polyethylene pips and was constructed in three phases during  1978, 1986, and 1996.  There is an existing propane air plant that was originally constructed in 1992 with a capacity of 334 Therms per hour.  The plant was modified in 1995 to increase the capacity to 1,000 Therms per hour.  The plant allows Fort McPhers on to purchase natural gas under an interruptible rate schedule.  There is a propane system located on site but will not be included in this acquisition.  The propane air contract will not be altered if the natural gas system at Fort McPherson is privatize d.  SYNOPSIS-Fort Gillem:  The Fort Gillem natural gas system redistributes natural gas from two metering locations within the installation boundary to approximately 119 buildings.  There are approximately 63,030 linear feet of natural gas pipe ranging in size from less than 2 inches to 12 inches in diameter.  In 1996, the entire natural gas distribution system was rebuilt using polyethylene pipe.  Fort Gillem has a propane air plant that was originally constructed in 1992 with a capacity of 667 Therms per hour.  The plant was modified in 1995 to increase the capacity to 4,000 Therms per hour. The plant allows Fort Gillem to purchase natural gas under an interruptible rate schedule.  There is a propane system located on site but will not be included in this acquisition.  The propane air contract will not be altered if the natural gas system at Fort Gillem is privatized.  SYNPOSIS-Fort Stewart:  Fort Stewart distributes  natural gas  within the installation at a delivery pressure of 300 PSI.  Reduction to 40 P SI (the natural gas distribution system pressure throughout Fort Stewart) takes place at the pressure reducing station.  The natural gas lines are primarily coated steel pipe with a small amount of polyethylene pipe.  The average life of the system is esti mated to be about 40 years old.  There are approximately 110,920 linear feet (21 miles) of pipe ranging in size from less than 2 inches to 8 inches in diameter.  Fort Stewart utilizes approximately 76 valves of various sizes, and approximately seven main m eters to serve approximately 400 buildings.  Most of the service connections are in the housing area.  Fort Stewart has a propane air system that allows the purchase of natural gas under an interruptible rate schedule.  The plant is Government owned but op erated by an outside contractor.  The propane air plant contract will not be altered if the natural gas system at Fort Stewart is privatized.  SY

<SUBJECT>99 -- Treasury Department Adopts CCR Effective May 1, 2002
<DESC>Treasury Office of Procurement FedBizOpps Special Notice 
Implementation of the Central Contractor Registration System


SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) has partnered with the Defense Electronic Business Program Office (Defense e-Business) of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) to use the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) System to register vendors seeking to do business with the Treasury under the Federal Acquisition Regulations and to obtain financial electronic funds transfer (EFT) information. EFT information is entered and maintained by contractors using DOD's web-based CCR program (www.ccr.gov), which currently has information on over 190,000 contractors.

EFFECTIVE DATE: Effective May 1, 2002.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:  Direct questions on Treasury's use of CCR to Richard Miller at richard.miller@do.treas.gov.  Submit questions on the CCR system via e-mail to the Defense e-Business office at contact.ccr@us.pwcglobal.com or the CCR Assistance Center 888-227-2423 or 616-961-4725 or at dlis_support@dlis.dla.mil.  The Assistance Center is available Monday through Friday, 7am - 5:30pm EST. 

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: All Treasury contracts will contain (FAR) 48 CFR 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer--Central Contractor Registration in lieu of (FAR) 48 CFR 52.232-34, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer--Other than Central Contractor Registration and 52.232- 35, Designation of Office for Government Receipt of Electronic Funds Transfer Information.  

This means contractors receiving payments under Treasury contracts, purchase orders, delivery orders, task orders, basic agreements, basic ordering agreements, blanket purchase agreements, or other contractual vehicles must be registered in the CCR.  The EFT information in the CCR must be accurate in order for contractors' invoices or contract financing requests to be considered proper invoices for the purpose of prompt payment under Treasury?s contracts.  

Current and prospective contractors are encouraged to register in the CCR without delay.  By registering, the paperwork burden imposed by (FAR) 48 CFR 52.232-34 and (FAR) 48 CFR 52.232-35 will no longer exist.  Standard Forms SF-129 and SF-3881 will no longer be completed by businesses for Treasury.  In lieu thereof, contractors will update their EFT information electronically through the CCR.  The Government Paperwork Elimination Act of 1998 requires that federal agencies provide businesses an electronic business information registration method such as is available through CCR, as an alternative to paper filing.

As of May 1, 2002, prospective contractors must be registered in the CCR database prior to award of a contract, purchase order, delivery order, task order, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchase agreement, except for?

(a)	Purchases paid for with a Government-wide commercial purchase card;

(b)	Awards made to foreign vendors for work performed outside the United States;

(c)	Classified contracts or purchases (see FAR 4.401) when registration in the CCR database, or use of CCR data, could compromise the safeguarding of classified information or national security;

(d) Purchases to support unusual or compelling needs of the type described in FAR 6.302-2 (However, vendors of such awards must register in order to receive payment);

(e) Awards waived by the Bureau Chief Procurement Officer.

Vendors that have Treasury procurement contracts, purchase orders, delivery orders, task orders, basic agreements, basic ordering agreements, or blanket purchase agreements which were awarded prior to May 1, 2002, and that do not fall under any of the exceptions listed above, must register in the CCR database (a) as a condition of any non-termination modification to their award dated after April 30, 2002, or (b) by September 30, 2003, whichever shall occur first.

<SUBJECT>66 -- Flow Injection Chemical Analyzer
<DESC>The USDA, Agricultural Research Service intends to procure a SECOND Flow Injection System to perform ammonia, nitrate/nitrite, Kjeldahl N, and orthophosphate analyses on soil and plant extracts, acid digests, and water samples.  The system shall be compatible with an EXISTING Lachat QuikChem 8000 Series Flow Injection Analyzer currently used in the research unit to allow interchange of parts, existing chemistry modules, chemicals and supplies, and consistency of data quality between instruments.  The chemistry system shall be expandable to accommodate other chemical analyses (such as carbonates, chloride, conductivity, pH, total phosphate, sulfate) in the future by simple addition of a chemistry module.  The system shall be capable of performing a minimum of two chemical analyses simultaneously with expansion capabilities up to six-simultaneous analyses in the future.  The entire system shall be easily field upgradeable in the future to include a random access sampler(minimum capacity of 300 samples) that will work with an automatic diluter (to be added) to automatically dilute out-of-range samples and prepare working calibration standards.  The system must be field upgradeable to include column- suppressed ion chromatography analyses on water and soil extract sample in the future.  The system shall come complete with state-of-the-art software to control the instrument, record results, generate user friendly reports, and have results available to user in spreadsheet form accessible by QuattroPro or Excel database programs.  The system shall come complete with an up-to-date data acquisition system.  The Lachat QuikChem 8000 Series Flow Injection Analyzer meets these needs including their patented Shared Peripheral System (SPS), which meets the need to upgrade instrument to run ion chromatography independently and simultaneously with flow injection analysis.  The is covered under Patent Number 5,492,831.  Lachat Instrument's QuikChem methods are protected under U. S. Copyright laws and their Omnion Software packages are protected under U.S. software copyright laws.
