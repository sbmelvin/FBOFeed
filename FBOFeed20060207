<SUBJECT>A--SIX-MONTH NO-COST EXTENSION OF NAS5-01096 TO UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS TO SUPPORT LASER RANGING OPERATIONS TO ARTIFICIAL EARTH SATELLITES AND CALIBRATION OF THE MCDONALD LASER RANGING SYSTEM

<DESC>NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) plans to contract for a no-cost extension on a sole source basis in accordance with 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source. NASA/GSFC currently obtain laser ranging operational support services for artificial earth satellites, and the maintenance and calibration of the McDonald Laser Ranging System (MLRS) located on McDonald Observatory in Fort Davis, Texas which is part of the NASA SLR Network on existing Contract NAS5-01096 with the University of Texas at Austin. These services are a continuation of the scientific and engineering mission operations support for the NASA Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) program. The services required include operations of a satellite laser tracking station and other services include data analysis, data assurance and quality control of MLRS data products in support of the International Laser Ranging Service (ILRS) and the International Earth Rotation Service (IERS), as appropriate.  A 6-month no-cost extension to Contract NAS5-01096 is necessary due to a delay in awarding the follow-on sole source contract to the University for the same services for the next 5 years.  The period of the extension is from February 28, 2006 through August 31, 2006 and it will be performed within the original estimated cost of the contract. The geometric location of MLRS is critical to the Space Geodesy Program. The exact location of the reference point at MLRS is known to about 1 centimeter of uncertainty, and was developed with over 25 years of observations contributing to the global data solution.  This reference point and the Greenbelt, MD site are used together as the two fixed references for NASA's global tectonic motion data solution.  Changing either one of these two reference points would require reinitializing the global solution which was established by over 25 years of data and would require nearly a decade of additional observations to produce a global solution with the same quality as the one that exists today. The University of Texas and NASA have developed a unique satellite tracking facility at the McDonald Observatory MLRS facility, and the University of Texas has highly trained and extensively experienced staff to continue the needed uninterrupted laser tracking support at the MLRS facility.   Due primarily to the critical geometric location of the University of Texas observatory and to the importance of continuity to the SLR database, the Contracting Officer has determined that the Government’s requirement for the Satellite laser Ranging Station cannot be obtained from any other source than the University of Texas. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on 2/22/06.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>The Federal Railroad Administration’s Office of Research and Development conducts a variety of research programs for improving rail transportation efficiency and safety.  Frequently, these programs are derived from short-term reactive conditions requiring the research to be performed as expeditiously as possible.  FRA’s intent is to award a Multiple Schedule IDIQ contract to 2 or more vendors in fulfilling these stated requirements.   This proposed acquisition is intended as a mechanism for providing timely responses in such instances, as well as to provide a mechanism for the support of programmed research.  As discrete research requirements are defined, individual task orders will be established under this contract to address specific research needs.  General topic areas which may be included in a task are: Railroad Vehicles; Non-electric Motive Power and Components: Hazardous Materials Transportation by Railroad; Railroad Operating Practices; Human Factors; Railroad Track, Structures and Components; Track-Train Interaction; Passenger and Freight Operations; Advanced Rail Systems Technology, including Positive Train Control; Railroad Signal, Communication, Control and Electric Traction Power.  Individual task orders may involve one or more of the above areas.  In the past, Human Factors Engineering has represented at least 20% of the overall effort of the contract.  It is estimated that roughly 36,000 labor hours of effort at an estimated cost of $5,000,000 will be required over the 3-year period of the contract term.  The RFP will also contain 2 optional years requiring roughly 10,000 labor hours per year.  The solicitation will be issued electronically using Fed Biz Ops on February 21, 2006.  No written copies will be available.

FPI 1000HI  ECONOMIC PRICE ADJUSTMENT
Supplement: LCL APPR

Twelve [12] months after contract award date, contract prices for the succeeding twelve [12] month period may be adjusted in accordance with the change in the Producer Price Index for [plastic products] (product code [PCU313111) from the date of award to the date of adjustment.  IT IS THE CONTRACTOR'S RESPONSIBILITY TO REQUEST THIS ADJUSTMENT. 

Adjustments may be requested for a period not to exceed 10 days after the eligible adjustment date.  Requests that are made after the 30-day limit will not be honored and the contract pricing will not be adjusted. The contractor shall submit any requests for adjustments in writing to the contracting officer.  Requests shall include a copy of the relevant index and must be within the allowed time period for adjustment.  Any adjustments authorized as a result of the adjustment request will not be retroactive.  The date the completed request is received by the contracting officer will be the effective date of any changes in price.

<DESC>PRESOLICITATION NOTICE This requirement is to provide external, independent technical reviews and evaluation services in support of the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management. The Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management (OCRWM) is working to complete an application for a license to construct a repository for spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste at Yucca Mountain, located in Nevada.   Recent activities have focused on strengthening technical defensibility through simplification of the repository design and ensuring readiness to submit the license application. There are multiple regulatory and oversight groups that closely follow the OCRWM Program, including the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board, branches of the National Academy of Sciences, and others.  The interfaces with these groups provide valuable ideas and perspectives that are important to the overall acceptance and credibility of the Program.  There is a need for additional independent technical evaluation of Program activities. Additionally, OCRWM has announced a new approach to development of a repository at Yucca Mountain that will simplify waste handling and disposal by reducing fuel handling at the repository site.  As this plan is developed, OCRWM will subject the conceptual and design work for independent, external technical review. Under this effort, the contractor will be required to provide external, independent technical experts to review and evaluate various aspects of the OCRWM Program.  Technical experts will be expected to provide a range of services, including evaluating conceptual and design work, reviewing scientific data, reviewing lead laboratory activities, and assessing other OCRWM scientific and engineering work. The North American Industry Classification System code is 541990 with a size standard of $6M. The solicitation will be available through the Industry Interactive Procurement System (IIPS) on or about March 9, 2006.  You may register and access the IIPS system at http://e-center.doe.gov.  This solicitation will be issued electronically in accordance with FAR 4.500 and 5.102(a)(1), therefore, hard copies will not be provided.  There will not be any printed or hard copies of the solicitation mailed.  Additionally, most public libraries have resources available to electronically access and download the solicitation. CAUTION: This solicitation will be issued electronically as will any amendments thereto. Because of this, the Government is under no obligation and is in fact unable to maintain a complete bidders list.  It is therefore incumbent upon any interested parties to periodically access the above internet address in order to obtain any amendments which may be issued.  Failure to obtain any said amendments and to respond to them prior to the date and time set for receipt of proposals may render your proposal nonresponsive and result in rejection of the same.

<SUBJECT>R--Technical Support for the Russian Plutonium Disposition Program
<SOLNBR>DE-SS52-06NA27398
<RESPDATE>022806
<ARCHDATE>08282006
<CONTACT>Teresa Martinez, Contracting Officer, 505-845-4127, tmartinez@doeal.gov;Maggie Howe, Contract Specialist, 505-845-6028, mhowe@doeal.gov
<DESC>The Department of Energy (DOE), National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), requests information regarding the interest of potential sources in a contemplated acquisition for Technical Project Support for The Russian Plutonium Disposition Program. The Russian Plutonium Disposition Program is potentially a $2B plus activity to dispose of 34 metric tons of surplus weaponâ€™s grade plutonium that has been recovered from the Russian Federationâ€™s dismantled nuclear weapons.  The program is administered by the NNSAâ€™s Office of International Programs, NA263, and receives support from DOE laboratories and other contractors.  NNSA and Rosatom have agreed that the surplus plutonium will be converted to Mixed-OXide (MOX) nuclear fuel and irradiated in nuclear reactors located in the U.S. and Russia.  As such, there are significant activities associated with: 1) the MOX fabrication facility, 2) nuclear plant modifications necessary to use MOX fuel, and 3) development of a new, more efficient MOX consuming reactor design, the Gas Turbine Modular High Temperature Reactor, GTMHR. The potential contractor will provide technical support to NNSA and the U.S. Russian Joint Working Group (JWG) by assisting with the coordination and facilitation of the planning, design, approval and implementation of some or all plutonium disposition activities in the Russian Federation.  The contractor will provide technical support activities for individual projects within the Program Office, such as independent confirmation that specific equipment, building or facilities in Russia are at the expected state of completion; facilitate waivers of Russian taxes for Program Office contractors and their sub-contractors of all tiers; and analyses of Russian nuclear power plant designs and modifications required to convert the power plants for Mixed-Oxide (MOX) fuel usage.  The following is not an exhaustive list of the support being considered; it is merely illustrative of some of the kinds of project support contemplated. Example #1:    Assist NNSA management in preparing for meetings in Russia, e.g. management, technical, and/or contracting meetings.  Help prepare the meeting notification and agenda.   Prepare a draft of the meeting protocol in advance of the meeting and distribute to meeting attendees for review.  (Another contractor will make the logistics arrangements for the meeting, e.g. obtain meetings rooms, provide interpreters, etc.) Example #2:     Using a combination of in-house and sub-contracted experts from Russian laboratories, and specialized contractors, prepare economic and feasibility studies of modifying Russian VVER 1000 reactors for use in the plutonium disposition mission.   The scope of such studies may include: 1) determining the lifecycle cost to modify, operate, and maintain the reactors if they are converted to use MOX fuel, 2) determining the long term cost of electricity if the current fuel was replaced, and 3) identification of licensing or regulatory requirements, or economic impact studies required, to convert the reactors to MOX. Example #3:     The Gas Turbine Modular High Temperature Reactor (GTMHR) project is designing and building a new fuel manufacturing facility in Russia. Several pieces of new equipment have been designed and installed at the facility and the Russian contractor has submitted an invoice for payment. Perform an independent onsite review of the equipment for NNSA to ensure it meets acceptance requirements, witness acceptance tests, and take electronic photos of the installed equipment for NNSA management. To obtain the required specialized expertise to perform these activities, the potential offeror may choose to establish subcontracts and/or relationships with Russian government agencies, laboratories, and/or companies.  The major Russian organizations engaged with the Program Office in the Russian plutonium disposition activities are: the Russian Federal Agency for Atomic Energy (ROSATOM), TVEL, architect â€“ engineering firm IPPE, Rostekhnadzor, nuclear reactor designer OKBM, and Rosenergoatom. Contractor personnel assigned to this effort will not handle classified information, although they may handle Foreign Government Confidential Information, commercial proprietary, and/or Official Use Only documents. Contractorâ€™s facilities, procedures and personnel must be qualified to handle such documents. Potential offerors are requested to submit statements of capabilities (SOCs) to this office.  Each SOC shall contain pertinent and specific information addressing the following areas:  1) Experience: an outline of previous efforts, specific work previously performed and any in-house effort, relevant to this effort, including experience contracting with relevant Russian organizations, and administering VAT waivers in Russia; 2) Personnel capability including professional qualifications and specific experience, and 3) a description of the proposed approach to doing the work.  The SOCs are due within 3 weeks from the date of this synopsis.  It is requested that SOCâ€™s be limited to 15 pages. All replies to this synopsis must reference the sources sought identification number.  Please email SOCs and any comments/questions to the Contract Specialist, Maggie Howe, at mhowe@doeal.gov. In accordance with NNSA mandate, this acquisition will be reserved for small business; thus, maximum small business participation is desired including small business contractor teaming arrangements.  Firms responding should indicate if they are a large, small, an 8(a), a HUB Zone small business, a veteran owned small business, a service disabled veteran small business, a historically black college or university, a woman-owned business, or a minority institution. Potential offerors should be aware of their size qualifications under NAICS code 541611, size standard $6,500,000. This request for information does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued, nor will the Government pay for the information solicited in this sources sought announcement. NNSA is a strong advocate for the small business community and interested small businesses/lead teams and joint ventures that qualify as small businesses are especially encouraged to submit a response to this notice.  An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear the concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The purpose of the Ombudsman is to receive and communicate serious concerns from potential offerors when an offeror prefers not to use established channels during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  Potential offerors should communicate first with the Contracting Officer (Teresa Martinez, (505) 845-4127) or the Contract Specialist (Maggie Howe, (505) 845-6028) to request information, pose a question, and voice concerns before contacting the Ombudsman.  In those instances where offerors cannot obtain resolution from the Contracting Office, they are invited to contact Stephen Law at (202) 586-4321. For non-contractual questions, please contact David Dixon at (505) 845-4817.

7.	The contractor will replace all of the current speaker cable with 18 gauge plenum speaker wire. 
8.	The contractor will create listening zones in the room so that when an individual is speaking the speakers in their zone are muted thus allowing the controller to increase the gain on the speaker’s microphone.     
9.	The contractor will remove, replace and strategically move all the surround sound speakers in the room that are on the walls.  These speakers need to be controlled by the UI also.
10.	The contractor will remove and replace the current microphones with microphones that don’t have goose-necks and have only one pivot point at the base of the microphone to allow the user to move the microphone in one direction only allowing the user to make more room on the desk.  The microphones need to have a light to indicate which user is speaking.  This light is placed at the top of the microphone around the actual speaking part of the microphone. 
11.	The contractor will provide push-to-talk buttons on all microphones minus the podium.  The buttons will have a light inside indicating that the microphone is active.  Then the button is pushed the light is on.  The buttons need to have the capability to stat on once pushed and then when pushed again the light goes out and the microphone is muted.  These need to be out of the way but still in easy reach. 
12.	The contractor will provide small, non-obtrusive labels stating “Push to talk”.  Preferably brass with black letters 2” wide by 1/2” tall with good double-sided tape on the back.   They will be placed near the button and near the microphone. 
13.	The contractor will replace the current microphones and cover the two (2) holes that are in the top of the desks by each microphone.  The new microphones will use the plate that will be covering the holes.  The plate needs to be able to cover both holes.  Preferable square plates with rounded corners.  The wires from the microphones should be unexposed and under the desks.   
14.	The contractor will provide 8-10 high quality, small, ceiling hanging microphones.  To pick up the speaker’s voice at the podium or if they choose to walk around in between the horse-shoe table.  The microphones will need to pick up the speakers voice anywhere in that area.     
15.	The contractor will provide a switch of sorts to connect the sound system of the VCR and the computer/microphones.  Currently the sound from the VCR goes through separate speakers and we need the VCR to go through the same system as the microphones.

This solicitation will be issued using a two-phase indefinite quantity Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACC) for construction, design, alternation and repair of government facilities in the states of Indiana, Tennessee and Illinois.  The solicitation will be issued unrestricted and will result in multiple (not more than four (4)) firm-fixed price contracts to obtain services including labor, material, transportation, equipment and supervision required to accomplish various types of construction projects, including design-build and fully designed projects, (including Military Construction (MILCON) projects, as well as projects with minimum or no design required.  The successful proposers will be required to validate designs against the RFP requirements and accept design responsibility (i.e. sign and seal design drawings and specifications by registered professional engineers and architects).  

Contractors who are selected to receive a MACC award will be given the opportunity to compete for future individual task orders.  The estimate range of task orders awarded under this contract is between $250,000 and $15,000,000.  The basic contract period shall be for five years (60 months) with a maximum value not to exceed $200,000,000.  The NAICS Code for this proposed procurement is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction and the annual size standard is NTE $28.5 Million.  

In Phase I a maximum of seven (7) firms will be pre-qualified to participate in Phase II procurement.  The solicitation will be formatted as an RFP in accordance with the requirements designated by sections of FAR 15.203 and NFAS for a negotiated procurement utilizing the Two-Phase Design-Build section procedures of FAR 36.3.  This method permits evaluation of proposals based on price competition, technical merit and other factors; permits impartial and comprehensive evaluation of offerors’ proposals; permits discussions if necessary; and ensures selection of the source whose performance provides the best value to the Government.  The evaluation factors for Phase I are as follows:  Past Performance and Relevant Project Experience, Technical Qualifications, Management Approach, and Small Business Sub-Contracting Effort.

Only those highly qualified offerors who’s Phase I proposals are determined to be the most advantageous to the Government will be allowed to proceed to Phase II.

The Government intends on issuing the RFP Solicitation for Phase I and Phase II through the Internet at www.esol.navfac.navy.mil.  All prospective offerors MUST register themselves on the website.  The download time may be excessive, but all contractors are encouraged to attempt download prior to obtaining the solicitation through alternate sources.

Offers will not be publicly opened.  The number of offers received, the identity of the offers received, the amount of any offer or relative standing of the offers will not be disclosed to anyone until the time of contract award.  

IMPORTANT NOTICE:  All contractors submitting bids, proposals or quotes on Department of Defense solicitations must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) prior to award of the contract.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to issue a sole source contract to Carleton Technologies Inc.,3018 North US Highway 301 Suite 800, Tampa, Florida 33619-2226 for the acquisition of four (4) each Naval Special Warfare (NSW) MK 16 Underwater Breathing Apparatus (UBA) Digital Electronics Packages.  The MK 16 Mod 0 Underwater Breathing Apparatus is used by Naval Special Warfare (NSW) divers in the Seal Delivery Vehicle (SDV).  Current electronics enables the UBA status to be shown to the diver via a primary display (worn on the left forearm) and the secondary display (worn on the right forearm).  Both displays connect to the UBA with cables.  Two pressure gauges, also connected to the UBA by cables, show the pressure remaining in each of the two breathing gas flasks.  The digital electronics package being acquired, combines four of these displays into a single unit, thereby reducing the number of cables.  This procurement is sole source for th!  e following reasons.  Carleton Life Support Technologies is the sole manufacturer of the MK 16 Mod 0 UBA, and is the only company that has a version of the digital electronics in production.  The MK 16 Mod 1 UBA, used by Explosive Ordnance Disposal divers, has been tested with the digital electronics.  Using these test results and lessons learned, Carleton Life Support is the only company that can modify the electronics for NSW MK 16 Mod 0 purposes.  NSW wishes to procure five (4) each NSW digital electronics packages for testing.   Therefore, this acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition. Delivery will be to the Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City, Panama City, FL 32407-7001. NAICS Code 541990 applies. SBA Size Standard is 500 employees.   FSC is 4220.  A request for quote will be utilized in awarding this action on or about 1 March 2006.

Those firms that may be contemplating a joint venture on this project, advise your Business Opportunity Specialist at the SBA, in writing, as soon as possible.  The procurement will be conducted using source selection procedures.  The award will be based upon the best value to the government considering tradeoffs between price and non-price related factors.  An example of the non-price evaluation factors follow, however; potential offerors will need to refer to the solicitation (when issued) for the selection criteria/factors to be evaluated by the government since they are subject to change.  A) EXPERIENCE - PROJECTS OF A SIMILAR NATURE, MAGNITUDE AND SCOPE; B) PAST PERFORMANCE - IN RELATION TO THE EXPERIENCE/PROJECTS SUBMITTED; AND C) CAPACITY - ABILITY TO PERFORM THIS PROJECT RELATIVE TO OTHER WORK.  The importance and weighting of the non-price factors in relation to price has yet to be determined by the source selection authority.  The estimated range of this project is $1,000,000 - $5,000,000.  The government intends to award a contract without discussions with the potential contractors.

Contractors are required to be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) government system prior to award to be eligible for a government contract - the link can be found at http://www.ccr.gov/ -- we advise potential offerors to begin the registration process when they prepare their proposal to ensure the registration in the CCR database is complete and in-place should they be selected for the award.  In the event an offeror is not registered in CCR at the time the contracting officer is ready to award the contract, the contracting officer will proceed to the next eligible successful offeror registered in the CCR database.  Refer to FAR 52.204-7, Central Contractor Registration, "If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror."  Offerors submitting a proposal as a Joint Venture should remember that Joint Ventures must also be registered in CCR identical to the joint venture indicated in their proposal (failure to do so will make the offeror[s] ineligible for award).

<SUBJECT>F--Contractor Run Wild Horse Adoption Events Throughout the Eastern States
<SOLNBR>NAR060058
<RESPDATE>032206
<ARCHDATE>02072007
<CONTACT>Steven Santoro Contracting Officer 3032363518     Steven_Santoro@blm.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has a requirement for contractor run adoption events within the Eastern States for a base year plus four one year option periods. The following sets forth the background of BLM's needs and the basic requirements needed for contractor run adoption events. Wild horses and burros on public lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and Forest Service are protected, managed and controlled under the provisions of the Act of December 15, 1971, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1331 1340). As resource conditions and other factors warrant, excess wild horses and burros are removed from the public lands and placed in private maintenance through the Adopt A Horse program. Horses that have not been adopted because of age or other factors are being cared for on private land. The purpose of this procurement is to obtain one or more contractors to take possession of up to 40 animals at a time, with the expectation that these animals will be adopted by members of the general public. The objective of this contract is to procure services within the Eastern States Region, which includes 31 states adjacent to and east of the Mississippi River, to adopt 200 wild horses from private adoption facilities on a yearly basis. The contractor will be reimbursed one price for animals less than 2 years old and a higher price for animals 2 years and older once adopted. The price will be based upon the age of the animal on the date they are adopted.  Each animal will be considered one year older on January 1st (i.e. on Jan. 1st a horse born on Dec. 1st becomes one year old). The minimum guarantee for all contracts, when combined, is 200 animals for the life of the contract. The maximum for all contracts, when combined, is 2,600 animals. To insure that funding is available to reimburse the contractor, he/she shall notify the COR of their intent prior to selecting any animals. The contractor's facility will be open to the public, at least 40 hours per week, including Saturday and Sunday. Animals will be available on a first come-first serve basis, to any qualified adopter who is pre-approved by BLM to adopt a wild horse. The animal will be considered adopted when a Private Maintenance and Care Agreement is signed by the adopter and a BLM official, and payment of the adoption fee is received. It is the responsibility of the contractor to ensure that all adoption paperwork is delivered to the Bureau of Land Management within 3 business days. Contractors may encourage the placement of animals by gentling some of the animals in their care using resistance free methods, but gentling is not a requirement. The contractor shall provide all the necessary facilities, personnel, equipment, supplies and services to accomplish the following: Develop and execute a plan for marketing and placement of adoptable animals, including unscheduled walk up adopters and special advertised dates for public adoptions, especially on weekends; Provide necessary corrals, chutes, loading, unloading and handling facilities, and proper facility for the visiting public, including an office and restrooms; Provide humane handling and care of animals at all times, especially when sorting, loading, and while receiving veterinary care; Make a good faith effort to ensure the public and potential adopters are fully aware of BLM's laws, regulations and qualifications to adopt a wild horse; Provide a record keeping system which documents the number and type of animals maintained on the facility at all times, and the dates when each animal arrived and departed from the facility, plus the date of adoption and name of adopter for every animal. The record system will also track the marketing tool/method identified by the adopter and document the degree of customer (adopter) satisfaction; Provide transportation for adopted animals to the adopter's facilities as needed, at a reasonable hauling rate to be determined by the contractor; Submit a monthly invoice for payment of adopted animals, feed days, veterinary bills, and related invoices. The contractor shall also accomplish the following: Identify potential markets and adopters within Eastern States and develop/implement marketing and advance promotion plans aimed at the target market/potential adopter pool, emphasizing the laws and requirements a potential adopter must meet to qualify to adopt a wild horse; Select and execute the marketing tools/methods to promote and market adoptions at their facility. This may include print ads, Internet sites, chat groups, and private equine classified sites, and other outreach tools; Market the animals, assuring all marketing products identify the animals as available for adoption under the Bureau of Land Management's Adopt-a-Horse Program and positively portray BLM's adoption program and the trainability/versatility of the animals; choose up to 40 animals in any combination of age and type.  This may include weanlings, yearlings, mares, studs, or geldings, provided they have the facilities necessary to separate, feed and care for the selected animals.  Mare pairs may only be chosen if the foals are freezebranded.  The contractor may pick up from the Eastern States Holding Facility (22295 Sheep Farm Road, Ewing, IL 62836) or from a satellite adoption before unclaimed animals are sent back to the BLM Holding Facility; The contractor is responsible for the transportation of animals to their private facility, either by single deck tractor trailer, or gooseneck stock trailer. Stallions and mares two years and older will be separated inside the trailers. Horses less than 2 years of age may not be transported in the same compartment with horses 2 years and older, without written permission from the BLM. Animals may be transported by truck or trailer for a maximum time of 24 hours to the contractor's holding facility, or by the contractor to an adopter's facility after the animal has been adopted; The shipping records will be checked against the freezemark numbers and neck tags of each animal delivered for accuracy. Discrepancies will be reported to the COR immediately. Health records will be kept in numerical neck tag order in a filing cabinet inside the adoption office. Vaccination records and Coggins dates will be tracked by the contractor.  BLM will be notified if any animals are due for worming or inoculations, and 60 days before the expiration date of a Coggins report. This is not a complete list of the specifications, but a general overview to help prospective offerors decide whether or not to download a copy of the solicitation, which will be available on or about February 21, 2006. This requirement is 100% set aside for small businesses under NAICS 115210. Hard copies of the solicitation will not be provided.  Facsimile proposals will not be accepted.  Vendors must be registered at http://www.ccr.gov to be considered for award.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The US Army Tank-Automotive and Armaments Command- Picatinny has a requirement to purchase M31A2 Granular Propellant for M232A1 MACS Propelling Charge.  The government intends to solicit, negotiate, and award on a sole-source basis to EXPRO Tec, St. Timothee, Quebec, Canada. EXPRO Tec, St. Timothee, Quebec, Canada is the current sole source for the M31A2 propellant.  It has manufactured over 360,000 pounds of M31A2 triple-base propellant to support MACS M232A1 propelling charge development.  Additionally, Expro Tec was contracted to produce over 4.2 million pounds of M31A2 propellant.  Expro Tec has skilled personnel with extensive experience in solvent propellant production. The 155mm M231/M232A1 propelling charges known as MACS (Modular Artillery Charge System) satisfy all zoning requirements of 155mm artillery (M231-zones 1 and 2, and M232A1-zones 3 and higher).  The 155mm MACS propelling charges can be handled by automated loading/re-supply equipment and also manually.  Because of this versatility MACS can be used with currently fielded howitzers and future planned artillery systems. The resulting contract will be a firm fixed price contract for M31A2 granular propellant for M232A1 propelling charge. This requirement also includes an option(s) to purchase approximately 6 million additional pounds of M31A2 propellant. The point of contact for this procurement is Jaclyn Dâ€™Olivo, Contract Specialist, AMSTA-AQ-APC, Bldg. 10, Picatinny, NJ 07806-5000; email: jaclyn.dolivo@us.army.mil. See numbered note 22.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command (USASMDC) has contractual support requirements for the Asymmetric Warfare Group (AWG) The contractor will be expected to provide for the enhancement, sustainment, and integration of the AWG with direct suppport to the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization (JIEDDO) in the analysis, assessment, operations and training for counter-IED and asymmetric warfare operations throughout the world as well as the preparation of units scheduled for int roduction as replacement forces into overseas theaters of operation.  Effort to be performed is in support of operational forces that are experiencing frequent attacks by hostile forces using all forms of Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and other emerg ing threats.  Among ongoing tasks are the operational support of operational teams in the CENTCOM Theater of Operations to thoroughly investigate IED attacks, embed and train with deployed forces. In particular, the commander, AWG will require high levels of expertise in the areas in counter insurgency (CI) and counter terrorism (CT).  Specifically, the offeror must have extensive experience in advisement and support concerning Joint Special Operations, to include operational and developmental experience in  the use of explosives and their initiation, and the tactics and techniques associated with the use of explosives particularly as it relates to IED devices and all forms of asymmetric warfare. Asymmetric warfare (AW) is operations conducted by terrorists, guerillas, militias and paramilitaries to limit US military effectiveness while achieving political objectives.  Moreover, experience must include individuals with extensive backgrounds and established reputations in the development, organization, preparat ion and leadership of teams formed to respond in direct support of the vital interests of the Nation. Contracted effort requires that all contractors possess a minimum Security Clearance Classification of Secret, with some requirements for both Top Secret and Top Secret-Special Compartmentalized Information (TS-SCI).  Support to the AWG will consist of the following:  Advisement Team [see legal review] with established expertise in terrorist, guerilla and insurgent operations, experience with Joint Special Operations Forces and its relation to the development, formation, preparation and staffing of special teams in direct support of National level objectives.  This team will have experience synchronizing the transition of major projects and programs from sho rt life-cycle management to long-term strategic efforts.  This team will have demonstrated experience in recruitment, assessment, selection, and training procedure development.  Strategic Communications/Public affairs experience in information disseminatio n to the Soldier, the public, industry and other Government organizations is also required.  Training Advisory Team will consist of certified explosive experts trained and qualified, at a minimum, to U.S. Army standards to advise and train units at major u nit installations and Combat Training Centers throughout the Continental United States (CONUS) and other countries or locations at the direction of the AWG preparing them for combat operations and eventual deployment to any area of operation (AOR).  This t eam will also include research analysts, and a Program Coordinator.  Operations Squadron Teams will consist of multiple teams consisting of broadly gauged experts to perform the training of IED mitigation measures and counter IED tactics, techniques and pr ocedures to forces committed and forces preparing for entry into regions of hostility. The Operation Squadron Teams could be directed to investigate IED incidents and technologies anywhere in the world.  Advisement, Training Advisory and Operations Squadro n Teams will also possess the proven skills, abilities and cognitive traits for operating in highly stressful environments of Counter-Insurgency and Counter-Ter rorism threats.  These teams will show demonstrated abilities for adaptation to meet mission requirements addressing undefined and evolving Asymmetric threats.  Additionally, the effort will include in-depth and integrated analytic subject matter expertise  and programmatic support to the following functional areas and missions.  AWG Headquarters support will consist of liaison teams, which maintain the worldwide Joint Common Operational Picture, provide supply, maintenance and chemical/biological protection  support and integration of materiel solutions.  Operations Squadron support will consist of personnel available to deploy worldwide to observe, record and disseminate emerging AW Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs), provide AW training and assist in  identifying and integrating AW countermeasure technologies.  Support to the Training Advisory and Assessment Squadron will consist of analysis of intelligence, operational TTPs, training and materiel solution inter-relationships and the ability to articul ate them in a strategy to combat asymmetric threats.  Support to the Concepts Integration Squadron will consist of coordination of AW materiel requirements with the appropriate materiel command and the responsible acquisition executive as well as liaison w ith research and development and acquisition communities. The NAICS code for this effort is 541710/1000 employees.   This acquisition will not be open to participation by foreign firms at either the prime or subcontract level. Specific performance requirem ents will be set forth in the Task Orders (T/Os) issued under the contract.  The resultant contract will be an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract awarded from a full and open competition. It will consist of a five-year basic contract. The Government does not intend to limit either the number or types of teaming arrangements entered into by the potential offerors (i.e., any given contractor could propose as a prime contractor as well as participate as a subcontractor on one or more other  proposing teams).  Further, we do not intend to impose any restrictions on team membership after award.  The expected release date of the final RFP is 15 February 2006 with proposals due on 31 March 2006.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) has a requirement to acquire one (1) Structural Health Monitoring Systems with the option to purchase a 2nd one for the WP-3D aircraft.   Data gathered from the system will be temporarily monitored and interpreted by the contractor with the agreement of the contractor to train AOC personnel to monitor and interpret data and transfer the function to the AOC within a reasonable time period.  Installation of the health monitoring system on a second aircraft will be based on the performance of the first installed system.  Some of the requirements include, but are not limited to the following:  1) The system must be capable of monitoring the entire aircraft wing, focusing on the key elements of the P-3 structure as designated by the Navy Service Life Assessment Program (SLAP) program as specific areas of concern; 2)  The associated sensors, wiring harnesses and attachment fittings must be capable of being installed on the WP-3D while the aircraft is in depot maintenance, and must be accomplished by a small team within a reasonable period on a not to interfere basis, so that the depot maintenance duration is not prolonged;  3)  The system must monitor the aircraft structure continuously through the flight regime, as well as during ground operations such as taxi, takeoff, and landing rollout, and be capable of identifying damage to the structure at the precise moment it occurs;   4)  The data collection device in the aircraft must be capable of storing up to 50 flight hours and be readily downloadable for analysis;   5)  NOAA maintenance personnel will download the aircraft data and forward to the appropriate organization for analysis. The analysis of the in-flight structural data must be provided as an included service, and completed within one week of submission of data. The analysis service must also have the capability to perform a 24 hour turnaround of data if NOAA identifies a specific flight as likely to have caused damage to the aircraft;   6)  The analysis will initially be accomplished by the vendor but ultimately will be performed by NOAA personnel. The vendor will develop appropriate user software so that the analysis can be accomplished locally;  7)   Any damage that the system detects must be defined within a 4 inch radius. The specific location of the structural anomaly should be displayed electronically to the maintenance technician in a CAD drawing of the P-3 wing and empennage structure. The CAD system must be capable of zooming in or out, panning or rotating the damaged structural part, and identifying it by physical location (i.e., wing station) as well as by part number and nomenclature;   8)  The CAD system will not only be used for identifying and locating damage, but will also be used for the training of structural maintenance personnel. The CAD system must also have the capability of graphically recording repair information so that the digital image can be maintained as a permanent record of repair and structural modification for each aircraft;   9) Although not a Flight Data Recorder with specific crash survivability requirements, the system must be capable of recording up to 24 user-defined inputs for the duration of each flight. These inputs (i.e., airspeed, altitude, GPS position, angle of bank, control position, etc) must be capable of correlation at the specific time that damage occurs to the structure; eg. The location of the aircraft, what the conditions of flight were, and what precisely the aircraft was doing when the damage occurred. The goal of this capability is to be able to review flight procedures and to modify severe weather operating doctrine to minimize damage to the structure and; 10)  An optional mission replay capability shall be available in which the aircraft can be displayed with elective overlays that will include a geo data base with terrain features. The system(s) are to be delivered to the Aircraft Operations Center, 7917 Hangar Loop Drive, MacDill AFB, Florida.  Request for Proposal (RFP) No. WC133M-06-RP-0063PY will be issued on or about February 24, 2006.    The NAICS code for this acquisition is 336413.  Interested parties are to request a copy in writing from Edward.H.Mackey@noaa.gov.

Per AFFARS 5352.201-9101: An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official.  Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.  Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.  Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).  If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Michael R. Jackson, HQ AMC/A7K, 507 Symington Drive, Scott AFB, IL 62225-5022, (618) 229-0267, fax (618) 256-6668, e-mail: michael.jackson@scott.af.mil.

The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.  Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements.  Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.

All Garments submitted should incorporate commercially  available innovative garment design and fabric performance to provide  comfort, functionality and durability.  Advanced performance technologies  such as garment/fabric “systems” a plus, and incorporation of Fiber/finish  Nanotechnology is also highly desirable. Important features to be considered are: Physical properties such as exemplary tensile and tear strength, the  ability to wick & transmit vapor, repel water, resist staining, abrasion &  air permeation.  Strong color performance properties to minimize Crocking,  CF to light, color change after laundering and Perspiration staining are  desired.  Priorities include reduction in overall weight, noise, and  durability to repeated home launderings.  The use of anti-microbial agents  is also beneficial.   Lining should address factors such as moisture  management/breath ability, abrasion resistance, stretch ability, and  optimal comfort as it will be worn closest to the skin.  Current suit is  used across varied climates.  In addition trunks may be used for swimming  in some cases, so resistance to salt & chlorine are also factors for  consideration. Finished garments should be the same or similar in appearance/design to  current specs (referenced above).   Any available industry advancements in  reflective technology are desired to optimize visibility/safety, and  should be incorporated.

The objective of the Aircrew Laser Eye Protection (ALEP) Block 2 program is to develop, manufacture, field, and sustain a system that will provide Air Force aircrew members protection against laser devices/systems in combat, in military operations other than war, and in training situations while minimizing visual performance degradation.  Aircrews will employ the ALEP Block 2 whenever laser devices (e.g., weapons, rangefinders, and designators) are likely to be employed by US, Allied, or unfriendly forces.  ALEP Block 2 will protect against invisible and visible laser wavelengths from both threats and hazardous equipment.  ALEP Block 2 must also be compatible with aircrew life support equipment (LSE) and provide prescription capability.  Multiple ALEP devices may be required because of the challenges imposed by laser protection versus luminous transmittance challenges, or because of the limitations due to LSE physical compatibility challenges.   When the technology allows, the protection offered by the ALEP Block 2 will be changed during production upon notification by HQ ACC/XO of an emerging threat.  When the technology allows, the production process should allow the capability for changes in the wavelength protection of ALEP Block 2 to counter an emerging threat as determined by HQ ACC/XO.

The ALEP Block 2 program is an Acquisition Category (ACAT) III program.  The Air Force’s acquisition strategy is to enter into Full and Open Competition for the System Development and Demonstration (SDD)/Production phase(s).  The RFP includes two documents that are not approved for public release:  the ALEP Block 2 Performance Specification (PS) Classified Annex and the ALEP Security Classification Guide (SCG).  The information in these documents is essential for proposal preparation/submittal.

As cited in the FedBzOps Notice each offeror must submit their CAGE code Code and classified fax number for security verification.  If classified fax number is not available, please provide a classified mailing address.

The release of the two documents mentioned above will require two actions: (1) Verification by Defense Security Services of your company’s security status (any offerors who have not submitted their CAGE Code and classified fax number/mailing address previously must submit this information ASAP); and (2) Official request of these documents shall be submitted to the contracting officer via email to annabel.rivera@brooks.af.mil.

Contracting Officer is Mr. William Foran, HSG/PK, 210-536-5541.

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is the initiation of market research under Part 10 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), and is not a Request for Proposals (RFP). The Government does not intend to pay for any information furnished pursuant to this RFI.   The DoD Power Sources Technology Working Group (PSTWG) and the Joint Defense Manufacturing Technology Panel (JDMTP) working through the Next-Generation Manufacturing Technology (NGMTI) Program, is soliciting expressions of interest from U.S. industry, academic organizations, and other government agencies regarding the creation of a Strategic Investment Plan for Power Source Systems.  The topic encompasses power source technologies including batteries, fuel cells, supercapacitors, hybrid systems, and other potential solutions to meet the challenges of providing power for military uses including communication electronics, aviation, weapons, space, vehicular power, and special applications.  An initial 3-day strategic planning workshop is scheduled for February 28 to March 2, 2006 in Knoxville, TN.  This workshop will develop the general content of the Power Source Systems Strategic Investment Plan and establish a foundation for further planning for potential R&D projects.   Due to space constraints and the need to ensure a balance of industry and government perspectives, participation in the workshop is by invitation only.  If you are interested in attending this workshop, please complete the short information questionnaire posted below and return it together with your firm’s qualifications via email by 15 February to Anthony Hawkins at LogR&D@navy.mil.   Questionnaire To assist us in selecting the appropriate team to develop the Power Source Systems Strategic Investment Plan, we are asking interested parties to respond to the following questionnaire.  1.	Is your company or organization currently researching, developing or producing power sources for a DoD system or program?  If so, please identify and briefly describe your program(s)/application(s): 2.	In your opinion, what technical issues present the greatest barrier to providing electrical power to current and future warfighter equipment? 3.	What technical topics might benefit most from creation of a strategic plan to guide collaborative, industry/government research and development of power source technologies? 4.	What new or future power source technologies should the DoD pursue beyond batteries, fuel cells, supercapacitors, and hybrids? 5.	What technical area(s) do you represent? 6.	Please provide any roadmaps - to share in advance - with your submittal of this questionnaire.  7.	Please provide your contact information:  a.	Name  b.	Company c.	Address d.	email e.	phone Responses to this RFI that indicate that the information therein is proprietary or represents confidential business information will be received and held in confidence for U.S. Government   use only.

<DESC>WORKSHOP ON INTRA-CHIP COMMUNICATION

The Microsystems Technology Office (MTO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is organizing a workshop to discuss the technical challenges and opportunities for photonic intra-chip communication for ultradense two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) chips.  Increasing device density and higher operating speeds impose ever-increasing demands on communications between devices and functional units on an ultradense chip.  Photonic technologies offer potential advantages for communications and this workshop will focus on a discussion of innovative ideas that could enable photonics to meet the challenging demands of intra-chip communications.   We are explicitly interested in an open discussion on pros and cons of photonic and electronic intra-chip communications and the most promising technologies and approaches.

While we envision the development of photonic intra-chip communications as being potentially beneficial for any ultradense chip, we focus on photonic intra-chip communications for high-performance microprocessors in order to make the discussion more concrete.  We pose a set of questions to the community in attempting to address this topic:
- Are there clear and significant (quantifiable) benefits associated with using photonics for intra-chip communications?  What are the opportunities?  Challenges?
- What are the right metrics for measuring performance improvement in intra-chip communications? 
- How would these communication benefits quantitatively translate into processor performance improvements, if implemented today or at a future technology node?  
- What are the relevant performance requirements on photonic devices (modulators, detectors, etc.) to enable such high-performance photonic intra-chip communications?  
- How can the stringent size, power, tunability, and other performance requirements for photonic devices be met?  
- How can such photonic devices and infrastructure essential for intra-chip communication be integrated into traditional electronic chips in a manner compatible with modern CMOS processing?
- Are there novel photonic communication architectures that would be significantly superior to current electronic communication architectures?
- What are the most promising methods of fabrication of these chips?
- How can chip design technologies take advantage of photonic communications?

Please note that this workshop is not a formal solicitation for proposals or proposal abstracts.  The workshop is planned for March 27-28, 2006 in Arlington, VA, and will be by invitation only.  If you have innovative ideas that address these or other issues germane to photonic on-chip communications and would like to attend the workshop, please send a one-page write-up to Matthew Rogers (Matthew.Rogers.ctr@darpa.mil) by February 20, 2006.  Your write-up should include a brief description of the materials you would like to present as well as an overall description of your position regarding this technology area.  We will inform you of our decision by February 24, 2006.  A website with further information on the workshop and for registration will be provided at that time.  The government will not assume liability for costs incurred for travel expenses, presentations, marketing material, etc.  If there are questions related to the technical content of the workshop, please contact Jag Shah (Jag.Shah@darpa.mil 703-696-2253).  Jag Shah and Dan Radack are the MTO Program Managers sponsoring this workshop.

<DESC>The General Services Administration’s Federal Technology Service, Region 5 Chicago, on behalf of the U.S. Air Force Electronic Systems Center (ESC) Forces Protection Squadron, is issuing this Request For Information (RFI) in order to identify companies having the technology, qualification and capabilities to provide Hand Held and Desktop Explosion Detection Equipment for over 200 Air Force installations both Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside the Continental States (OCONUS).  Capabilities/qualifications submitted in response to this RFI will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  Responses will be evaluated for their viability.  The determination of procurement strategy, based upon the responses to this RFI, is solely within the discretion of the government.  All sources may submit a response, which will be considered by the government.  This RFI is for information and planning purposes only.  It does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Furthermore, the Government reserves the right to publish any information provided by a respondent to the RFI if publishing such information is done without attribution (i.e., does not identify the party submitting the response materials), and would not reveal company trade secrets or other similar protected or proprietary information.  For example, if a respondent were to ask when the draft RFP would be released, then such a question could be published without attribution and would not jeopardize any corporate or trade secrets of the respondent.  Accordingly, the Government may publish such materials.  On the other hand, if a respondent were to provide detailed product rollout plans for a new device, then that material would not be published if properly marked.

We invite comments/information on the following:
•	A respondent’s commercial-off-the-shelf product(s) and capability(-ies) to meet the requirements as drafted in the attached technical requirements document.  
•	Whether the above products and capabilities are currently available on an established Government contract (i.e., GSA FSS Schedule).

<SUBJECT>D -- WORLDWIDE REFUGEE ADMISSIONS PROCESSING SYSTEM
<SOLNBR>SAQMPD06R1042
<CONTACT>Leo Powell, Contract Specialist, Phone 7038756071, Fax 7038757370, Email powellhl@state.gov
<DESC>The United States Department of State will release the above referenced solicitation in approximately 60 days from todays date.  If interested, respond by e-mail to PowellHL@State.Gov.
No advance information will be provided prior to the release of the solicitation.

The scope of this requirement is for a complete range of support to the management, operations, and WRAPS application software development, delivery, deployment and maintenance of the Refugee Processing Center (RPC) in Rosslyn, Virginia and the Worldwide Refugee Admissions Processing System (WRAPS).

The objective of this Task Order is to accomplish all the activities associated with providing the aforementioned support while employing industry best practices in project management and software development, including risk mitigation to ensure on-time delivery within budget and innovative techniques to minimize costs.

The challenge is supporting and maintaining WRAPS as an operational system so that there is minimal or no disruption in the timely processing of refugees, and at the same time allowing for the planned addition of features and functionality as well as responding to field-driven changes.

Rather than focus on simple operations and maintenance, DoS seeks a contractor that will bring a mission focus that provides highly effective, secure, and reliable computing and processing resources.  The winning contractor must also continuously identify methods for applying information technology to improve PRM’s mission performance and reduce program costs.  DoS places special emphasis on the contractor’s ability to proactively offer innovative solutions and look for ways to reduce the total life-cycle cost for WRAPS and the RPC, so that the savings realized from the program can be applied to benefit the processing of an even greater number of refugees.  DoS is anticipating a best-value procurement emphasizing a stable cost environment with a potential term of 5 years.

Tasks include, but are not limited to, providing geodetic control ties to all surveyed boundaries, deed research, traversing, marking true boundaries and monument corners, preparation of survey plats, legal descriptions and reports of survey.  Your company must be licensed in the respective state in order to be considered.  An Indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract will be awarded for Arkansas.  The number and magnitude of projects to be undertaken are dependent upon priority and availability of funds at the time task orders are issued.  The Fish and Wildlife Service will consider company experience during the past 10 years when evaluating capability.  The following factors will be evaluated.  They are listed in descending order of importance.  1) professional qualifications and experience; 2) past performance in terms of cost control, quality of work and relevant experience; 3) geographic location and company familiarity with the area; 4) rural boundary survey experience; 5) type of field and office equipment (include version of equipment such as CADD version 12, etc.)  6) capacity to accomplish the work within the required performance period.  Firms responding to this notice shall submit a Standard Form 330 along with any information they deem to be of benefit to their company.

<DESC>The United States Government Printing Office is issuing this Request for Information as stated below:

GPO Public Notice for industry comment as a continuing part of industry market research from 2004.


Part of the mail out mail back campaign for the 2010 Decennial Census is to print and mail an 11” x 25.5” and an 11” x 28.5” questionnaire package to the U.S. public. A key requirement is that the questionnaire be “respondent friendly” and “data capture friendly” at the same time. A colored background is used to assist respondents in navigating the form and placing their answers. From a data capture standpoint, accurate and consistent color is critical in the sense that the colored background will be dropped out of the captured image during the scanning process. Therefore, the colored background must be printed within certain tolerances to facilitate dropout during automated data capture. For these reasons, one technology under consideration in the printing of these questionnaires is closed-loop color control (CLC). This process control and quality assurance tool could help to ensure that color tolerances are met. 

It is highly probable that the questionnaires will need to be printed with the short dimension (11 inches) parallel to the direction of the web through the printing press due to the finishing requirements of the questionnaire. The questionnaire will require two parallel folds and one perpendicular or cross fold for a finished questionnaire of 9” x 5.5”. We are aware that certain presses employ a 22” image cut off, making it difficult or impossible to incorporate color bars that would be trimmed off after printing. Presses with a longer cut off dimension could include color bars more easily.

QUESTIONS TO INDUSTRY

1.	What are the typical image cut off lengths seen on the installed base of heat-set web offset presses? Are different cut off lengths associated with different industry segments and press capabilities? 

2.	When CLC is used, how much density variation would typically be seen within a press run? How much when CLC is not used?

3.	If press limitations restrict the use of a qualified color bar, can other features be designed into the questionnaire that a CLC system can be configured to read in place of the standard color bar? For example, an alternative might be a solid bar extending across the length of the questionnaire, which would most likely be in the long dimension of the questionnaire perpendicular to the press web direction. Would this approach work better, just as well, or not as well, as a standard color bar?

4.	If a standard color bar is not used, and the questionnaire contains only flat tints with no areas of solid ink (i.e. there are no specific color control features designed into the questionnaire), can CLC be used effectively? Is it practical to print such a job at all?

All responses should be submited by Close of Business March 7, 2006 at Print2010@gpo.gov.  Telephone inquiries should be directed to Ms. Connie Linassi at 202-512-0258.

<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-C-TPAT-IC-2006
<RESPDATE>030106

<CONTACT>Sonya Harmon, Contracting Officer, Phone 202/344-3727, Fax 202/344-1190, Email sonya.harmon@dhs.gov
<DESC>Background:     U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) operates numerous industry partnership programs, domestic and international training projects in various countries throughout the world, which address the entire range of customs cargo, and conveyance security operations. The purpose of the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) is to partner with the trade community to enhance the security of the US and the international supply chains against the possible intrusion by terrorist organizations. C-TPAT requires the trade company participant to document and validate their supply chain security procedures in relation to existing CBP-C-TPAT criteria or guidelines.  As part of the C-TPAT process, CBP C-TPAT Supply Chain Security Specialists (SCSS) and the C-TPAT participant jointly conduct a validation of the company’s supply chain security procedures. The validation process is essential to verifying the company’s commitment to C-TPAT.  To effectively implement these programs, there is a need for the utilization of contractors on an intermittent (short-term) basis. Short-term or intermittent is defined as a single assignment for 180 days or less. Intermittent Contractors (ICs) will be required to perform various tasks such as those associated with validations, training, utilizing specialized equipment, or to provide professional and technical assistance in specific topical areas. The following is a delineation of the types of general services that ICs are expected to provide under their contracts, as required. A more specific description of services or tasks shall be identified and provided to the ICs upon selection and award of a specific contract.    

C-TPAT Validator:  The IC shall serve and be part of a C-TPAT team assigned to conduct supply chain security validations on companies that are part of the C-TPAT process.  This work requires extensive report writing and communications ability.  IC’s chosen for this position will be required to undergo two (2) weeks of successful C-TPAT training in Washington D.C in March, 2006. Once determined to be C-TPAT validator, the IC will be assigned to one of five (5) SCSS field offices.  The IC will coordinate all work, and travel requirements from the field office and be under the direction of the field officer supervisor.  Note: There may be times when another field office requires additional assistance in performing validations.  An IC may be required to supplement the field office with their services.          
 
TRAINING: The IC shall serve as a subject matter expert and/or presenter. The IC may be required to present customs or border control training based on an existing CBP curriculum. Instruction may include, but is not limited to, the areas of supply chain security, anti-terrorism measures, risk assessment, narcotics interdiction, port security, customs investigative techniques, money laundering, intellectual property rights, control of weapons of mass destruction, commercial import/export operations, or customs valuation. In general, the topic and contents of the course will be established, in advance, with course material normally provided by CBP. The selected candidate(s) is expected to have the appropriate experience and training to serve as an instructor in general and in specific areas of instruction.

COURSE DEVELOPER: The IC shall develop a set of course materials on a given topic for later presentation by either CBP personnel or in-country advisors. Courses to be developed could be in any customs, border control, or industry partnership related areas such as those described for TRAINING above. The selected candidate(s) is expected to have the appropriate experience and training in course development for one or more related areas.

 TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE: The IC may provide technical assistance in highly specialized areas such as legal reform, inspectional technology (high and low tech), port security, or specialized field operations. For example, in the area of legal reform, tasks may include the review of customs laws and regulations of a country, making recommendations for improvements, and/or providing technical assistance in the preparation of new laws and regulations that meet the needs of a specific country. The selected candidate(s) is expected to possess specialized knowledge, experience, and background related to specific areas of expertise.

TERMS and CONDITIONS: Most IC assignments will be less than 30 days, with adequate advance notice given prior to assignment/deployment.  It is not envisioned that the IC will be on duty more than 180 days in a calendar year. If an IC declines more than two assignments, they may be excluded from further consideration at the discretion of CBP.  CBP reserves the right to cancel a contract in the event the IC does not fully meet the expectations of the assignment.      

POSSIBLE DUTY LOCATIONS: ICs must be willing and able to work in any country in which CBP C-TPAT conducts validations. CBP C-TPAT validations are being scheduled for Brazil, Jordan/Turkey, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Indonesia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Colombia, Mexico and Canada during 2006. This travel may at times be to high-risk locations as stated above.  As an anti-terrorism program, C-TPAT requires its Supply Chain Specialist along with the IC to travel to parts of the world that may have had past terrorist incidents.  

COMPENSATION and OTHER REIMBURSEMENTS: 1) ICs will be compensated for their performance on a fixed-priced basis at the rate of $2,400.00 per week for all ICs or prorating thereof (i.e., $480.00/day, $60.00/hour), for the period of time estimated by CBP for completion of the assignment, excluding travel days. 2) All authorized contract work will be paid at the above weekly/daily/hourly rates. There are no provisions for an overtime or premium rate. 3) The IC contract will include reimbursement for the required medical evacuation coverage, not to exceed $500.00, and medical examination costs up to $500.00. Immunization shots may be required for certain countries.  CPB will compensate the IC for receiving the necessary immunization.  4) All travel will be under U.S. Government travel orders (separate and apart from the contract) and in accordance with applicable U.S. Government travel regulations.  
       
NOTE: ICs will be reimbursed for all official travel upon completion of a travel voucher in accordance with an approved travel authorization. The IC will be responsible for purchasing airline or other common carrier tickets subsequent to approval of travel. ICs are NOT authorized to receive an advance for expenses for lodging, meals and/or travel incidentals.

OTHER REQUIREMENTS: 1) Prospective ICs may be required to undergo updated background investigations to obtain a SECRET security clearance from CBP. If for some reason a clearance cannot be granted, the prospective IC may be excluded from consideration from any assignments calling for such clearances. 2) For some specific assignments, foreign language ability may be a requirement for selection. 3) All materials provided to or developed by the IC under a contract are the property of CBP Office of Cargo and Conveyance Security Division, and may not be released to any other party. 4) The relevant provision of the Trade Secrets Act reads as follows: “Whoever, being an officer or employee of the United States or of any department or agency thereof…publishes, divulges, discloses, or makes known in any manner or to any extent not authorized by law any information coming to him in the course of his employment or official duties or by reason of any examination or investigation made by, or return, report or record made to or filed with, such department or agency or officer or employee thereof, which information concerns or relates to the trade secrets, processes, operations, style of work, or apparatus, or to the identity, confidential statistical data, amount or source or any income, profits, losses, or expenditures of any person, firm, partnership, corporation, or association or permits any income return or copy thereof or any book containing any abstract or particulars thereof to be seen or examined by any person except as provided by law shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both, and shall be removed from office or employment.

<DESC>The Smithsonian Institution, a non-profit trust instrumentality established by Act of Congress of the United States in 1846 (20 U.S.C. 41 et seq.),  is seeking capability statements from interested contractors to establish multiple Open Term Indefinite Quantity Contracts to provide construction services for projects less than $5 million per project.

These Open Term Indefinite Quantity Contracts will cover miscellaneous construction, repairs, renovation and restoration projects as required by the Smithsonian Institution for various buildings and facilities comprising the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory’s complex located in and around Hilo, Hawaii and the summit at Mauna Kea, Hawaii.

Mauna Kea is a dormant volcano on the island of Hawaii, the largest and southernmost of the Hawaiian Islands.  The highest point in the Pacific Basin, and the highest island-mountain in the world, Mauna Kea rises 9,750 meters (32,000 ft) from the ocean floor to an altitude of 4,205 meters (13,796 ft) above sea level, which places its summit above 40 percent of the Earth's atmosphere. The broad volcanic landscape of the summit area is made up of cinder cones on a lava plateau.  Please be aware that ordinary vehicles cannot cope with the steep, unpaved road (you will need a four-wheel drive vehicle); the road up the mountain can be dangerous, particularly in bad weather; and the high altitude of the observatory carries health risks and routinely impairs physical and mental activity.  For additional information about the Mauna Kea site, please see:  http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/mko/index.html.

Interested firms should submit letters of interest and capability statements to the attention of:

Submissions via facsimile on or before February 10, 2006 are appreciated.

This request neither commits the Smithsonian Institution to pay any proposal preparation costs, nor obligates the Smithsonian to procure or contract for construction or services.  It shall not be construed as authorization to proceed with or be reimbursed for any of the costs for any of the work specified herein.

Please contact R. Lee Carson (carsonr@si.edu) of this office at (202) 275-0988, (202) 275-1263 (fax) with any questions regarding this project.

<DESC>Request for Information for a Enterprise Business Intelligence Capability 1.0	SUBJECT Request for Information (RFI) for an Enterprise Business Intelligence (BI) capability to provide logistics decision support and business knowledge to Army managers at various echelons in support of equipment, materiel, supply chain and other critical logis tics functions is being solicited. 2.0	DESCRIPTION The USA Aviation and Missile Command, at the request of the USAMC Logistics Support Activity (LOGSA) is seeking information from industry that will assist in the application, selection and possible deployment of a logistics business intelligence tool for A rmy-wide use. Specifically, The RFI seeks the following information: ·	BI Performance and features  Regulatory Compliance, Unique features/capabilities, analytical capabilities, statistics/graphs/trends ·	BI Scalability  Support for a growing number of users, support for a dispersed and diverse user base, and interoperability with database management systems. ·	Infrastructure requirements  Hardware, software, other operational/environmental factors ·	Complexity of deployment  - Development, deployment, training (ease of use), customer support ·	Sustainment requirements  Licenses (for production, test, and development environments), fees, upgrades, operations, compatibility, sustainment training ·	Future initiatives  integration with other areas, e.g., financial, procurement, etc Ï	Describe the integration or control of user access (Information Assurance/security) and the single-signon environments in which the solution can be integrated. 3.0	REQUIREMENTS The USAMC LOGSA provides logistics intelligence, lifecycle support, technical advice and assistance to the current and future force; integrated force, readiness, authorization, and asset logistics information for worldwide equipment availability, forward a nd reverse, distribution pipeline performance analysis, and asset visibility for timely and predictive decision-making. Our goal is to be the preeminent provider of logistics intelligence, policy, and customer support required to ensure Warfighter optimiza tion and dominance on current and future battlefields. ·	Current Logistics Standard Army Information Systems (STAMIS) and the evolving Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solution will provide logistics site operations and system transactional data processing in support of logistics site operations.  Data inter face among various Army STAMIS/ERP and other service systems (Joint and Combined Operations) will require a complex analytical capability to ensure relevant and actionable information is provided to decision makers. ·	Network connectivity via the DoD NIPRNet is envisioned as the primary mode of data transfer and systems communication.  Network operations is assumed to be a 24/7/365 operational capability.  Priority and availability of bandwidth for logistics informati on exchange varies. ·	Information content for analysis will include major items authorization, on-hand equipment, and serviceability status; historical INOP trends and repair cycle metrics; repair parts inventory, supply and supply chain metrics; in-transit visibility of inve ntory in motion; financial impacts to customer operations; traditional force and task force organization structures. ·	Data input will be Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU).  Policy and regulations may require the upgrade of data/information classification based on integration and aggregation of SBU data.  Possibility future transition into a SIPRNet environment should be considered. ·	System end users will vary greatly.  Users will consist of various government ranks (officer, civilians and enlisted), occupational specialties (supply, ordinance, finance, transportation, medical, infantry, etc.), and echelons of employment (tactical, o perational, and strategic). ·	Cross functional/business solutions that minimize analysis and synthesis of the i nformation by clients is essential, included ability to drill to causes of problems, what relief is in play ad alternative courses of action. Ultimately management by exception and simultaneous presentation/execution of resolutions is our vision. 4.0	POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS A BI solution must meet the functional and technical requirements specified above.  LOGSA is open to alternative concepts for solutions that meet these requirements.  LOGSA encourages creative and outside the box thinking in response to this RFI. LOGSA a lso desires for its BI design and solution to prevail for 5 years minimum with flexibility for incremental growth without major redesign and reinvestment. One possible solution would be to build a completely dedicated BI tool for use based on current and evolving military systems of record for related data.  Current policy and guidance requires LOGSA research and review of commercial off-the-shelf tools th at may meet our requirements. This RFI seeks information about a fully commercial off-the-shelf BI solutions to facilitate research, analysis and holistic solutions, and to provide logistics business intelligence to facilitate timely and accurate Army and Joint DoD logistics decision s in support of equipment and operations. 5.0	INFORMATION EXCHANGE MEETINGS Webcasts, VTCs or other follow up discussions will occur as required 6.0	DISCLAIMER This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation.

<SUBJECT>R--NASA CENTENNIAL CHALLENGES ANNOUNCEMENT OF PARTNERSHIP OPPORTUNITY FOR POSSIBLE CENTENNIAL CHALLENGES COMPETITIONS
<DESC>Through this Announcement of Partnership Opportunity (APO), NASA seeks to identify potential partner organizations for specific prize competitions to be conducted under Centennial Challenges (www.centennialchallenges.nasa.gov) within the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (www.exploration.nasa.gov) of NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C. Partner organizations will have the opportunity to contribute cash or non-monetary resources towards one or more prize competitions (or Challenges) that support the Vision for Space Exploration and ongoing NASA programs.  In exchange, NASA expects that individual Challenges will demonstrate technologies or operational capabilities, and produce highly visible competition events of interest to the partnering organizations.  Partner organizations may provide inputs to the structure and rules of the Challenges to which they contribute. Partner organizations may include but are not limited to: for-profit companies, universities and other non-profit or educational organizations, and professional or public organizations associated with space or aeronautics. Partner organizations cannot compete for the Challenges to which they contribute. All Challenges subject to this APO are still in the formulation stage, and no final decision has been made on whether or not to initiate the Challenges described in this APO.  Decisions to issue specific Challenges and their rules will be determined at later dates. CENTENNIAL CHALLENGES BACKGROUND NASA Centennial Challenges was established to conduct prize competitions in support of the Vision for Space Exploration and ongoing NASA programs. Centennial Challenges is modeled on past prize competitions, including the 18th century British Longitude Prize; early 20th century aviation competitions, such as the Orteig Prize won by Charles Lindbergh; the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Grand Challenge; and the privately funded Ansari X PRIZE. By making awards based on actual achievements instead of proposals, Centennial Challenges seeks novel and lower-cost solutions to engineering obstacles in civil space and aeronautics from new sources of innovation in industry, academia, and the public. TYPES OF PARTNERSHIPS NASA anticipates two types of Challenge partners:  Co-Sponsor Organizations and Allied Organizations. Co-Sponsor Organizations Co-Sponsor Organizations are those Challenge partners that contribute cash towards the prize purse for one or more Challenges.  In return for their cash contribution, the Co-Sponsor Organization would be associated with the specific Challenge, and/or the rules of the competition may require the winning contestant to grant certain rights to intellectual property or capabilities produced in the course of the competition to the Co-Sponsor Organization and /or the Government.  The specific details of Co-Sponsor arrangements will be determined through the Partner Selection Process and the specific agreement to be negotiated with the selected partner described below.  Co-Sponsor Organizations cannot compete in the Challenges to which they contribute.   Allied Organizations Allied Organizations are those Challenge partners that provide in-kind services, in addition to those that NASA will provide, to enhance the competition.  The specific details of these arrangements will be determined through the Partner Selection Process and the specific agreement to be negotiated with the selected partner described below.  Allied Organizations cannot compete in the Challenges for which they are partners.   TYPES OF CHALLENGES This APO seeks to identify prospective partners for specific Flagship and Keystone Challenges, each of which is described in greater detail in another document issued on Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) system, document ESMD-CC-0407 originally issued on November 5, 2004, “NASA Exploration Systems Mission Directorate Request for Comments on Draft Rules for Possible Centennial Challenges Competitions”. Individual Challenges will take one of two forms:  1) “first-to-demonstrate competitions”, like the Longitude Prize, Orteig Prize, and Ansari X PRIZE; and 2) “repeatable contests”, like the DARPA Grand Challenge.	It is important to differentiate between these types of Challenges because each will make different demands on Challenge partners. Flagship Challenges Flagship Challenges are intended to encourage external teams to independently design, develop, launch, and operate space missions and thereby generate innovative and/or low-cost approaches to various civil space goals that would not otherwise be pursued.   It is envisioned that all Flagship Challenges will be “first-to-demonstrate” competitions and will offer cash purses ranging from millions to tens of millions of dollars to the winners of individual competitions.  NASA intends to pursue this type of challenge once Congress has provided the necessary authority.	 Flagship Challenges will be open to competitors from private sector companies, non-profit research institutions, university researchers, student teams, hobbyists, and any combination thereof.  Examples of Flagship-type prize competitions include the Orteig Prize and the X PRIZE.	 The specific Flagship Challenges proposed that are the subject of this APO include: 	-	The Fuel Depot Demonstration Challenge 	-	The Micro Reentry Vehicle Challenge 	-	The Station-Keeping Solar Sail Challenge Details about these challenges can be found in FedBizOpps document ESMD-CC-0601, “NASA Exploration Systems Mission Directorate Request for Comments on Draft Rules for Possible Centennial Challenges Competitions”. NASA’s Centennial challenges program has established a link on the NASA Exploration Systems website (exploration.nasa.gov/centennialchallenge/cc_submit.html) for submission of challenge ideas; ideas for future challenges may be submitted by sending an email to ccideas@hq.nasa.gov. Keystone Challenges Keystone Challenges are intended to encourage the development and demonstration of advanced technologies and/or innovative capabilities that support NASA's mission areas, and, where possible, have strong synergy with other applications.  Keystone Challenges may be component-, subsystem-, or system-level demonstrations, and may involve robotic contests, drop tests, and/or atmospheric flight tests.	 Depending on the technical goal, Keystone Challenges may take the form of “first-to-demonstrate competitions” or “repeatable contests”, and will offer cash purses ranging from hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars to the winners of individual Challenges.  NASA intends to pursue those Keystone Challenges with large prize purses once Congress has provided the necessary authority. Keystone Challenges will also be open to private sector companies, non-profit research institutions, university researchers, student teams, hobbyists, and any combination thereof.  The Longitude Prize and the DARPA Grand Challenge are two examples of Keystone-type prize competitions.  Candidate Keystone Challenges for which NASA is seeking Co-Sponsor Organizations include, but are not limited to: The specific Keystone Challenges proposed that are the subject of this APO include: 	-	The Human Lunar All Terrain Vehicle Challenge 	-	The Lunar Night Power Source Challenge 	-	The Low-Cost Space Pressure Suit Challenge As with the proposed Flagship Challenges, details about these proposed Keystone challenges can be found in FedBizOpps document ESMD-CC-0601, “NASA Exploration Systems Mission Directorate Request for Comments on Draft Rules for Possible Centennial Challenges Competitions”. As noted above, NASA’s Centennial challenges program has established a link on the NASA Exploration Systems website (exploration.nasa.gov/centennialchallenge/cc_submit.html) for submission of challenge ideas; ideas for future challenges may be submitted by sending an email to ccideas@hq.nasa.gov. PARTNERSHIP SELECTION PROCESS NASA will select Challenge Partners based on the following evaluation criteria: • Ability of the prospective partner organization to administer the selected challenge; • Potential for the prospective partner organization’s mission, vision, and values to complement NASA’s vision, mission, and values; and • Prospective partner’s accessibility to expertise in the technology areas of the subject challenge competitions. Using the specific evaluation criteria, NASA will select the Challenge Partner(s) for Co-Sponsor Organizations and Allied Organizations who best demonstrate the ability to further NASA’s Vision for Space Exploration. NASA and a prospective Challenge partner may ultimately negotiate a Space Act Agreement (SAA) to define the terms of the cooperation.	The SAA will detail the contributions and responsibilities of NASA and the partner organization for a specific Challenge.  The agreement will also address other important aspects of the Challenge, such as Challenge rules, media rights and intellectual property rights. For the specific challenges that are the subject of this APO, Congressional authority will be required before they can be formally announced and conducted. NASA and a prospective challenge partner may enter into a preliminary Letter of Intent to initiate cooperation and negotiate in good faith towards a comprehensive SAA to be executed once existing restrictions, such as the requirement for Congressional authority, are removed. SUBMISSION DETAILS Responses to this Announcement of Partnership Opportunity should be no more than five pages in length and: Briefly describe your organization; • Provide all the pertinent identifying and contact information about the Organization and the principal individuals of the Organization, including name, mailing addresses, phone numbers, fax numbers, email addresses, etc.; • Identify the Challenge(s) in which your organization wishes to partner with NASA (see lists above); • Identify the type of partnership your organization is seeking, either a Co-Sponsor partnership or an Alliance partnership (see descriptions above); • Describe your organization’s reason(s) for wanting to partner on this Challenge(s); • In the case of prospective Co-Sponsor partnerships, include an estimate of the amount of cash funding your organization would be interested in contributing to the prize purse(s) for this Challenge(s); and • In the case of prospective Alliance Organizations, describe the prize competition administration capabilities that your organization could bring to bear on this Challenge(s). The following organizational/individual contact information should be included on any submission in response to this APO: 	-	Organization and/or Individual Name 	-	Complete Mailing Address 	-	Telephone Number(s) 	-	Email Address(es) 	-	Reference document number ESMD-CC-0602 Duration This Announcement of Partnership Opportunity will remain open until Allied Organizations for the five subject Challenges have been selected. To provide future opportunities to expand the number of Challenge partnerships and Allied Organizations, the original APO, FedBizOpps document ESMD-CC-0403 originally issued on November 5, 2004, will remain continuously open. NASA will begin evaluating submissions to this Announcement of Partnership Opportunity starting four weeks from this posting date.  Depending on the number of submissions received for specific Challenges, NASA may close some Challenges to submissions starting on that date.  Submissions received after that date for a Challenge that has been closed will be returned to the sender without review. Contact Information Questions regarding this Announcement of Partnership Opportunity should be directed to Ken Davidian, 202-358-0748 or kdavidian@nasa.gov. Submissions in response to this Announcement of Partnership Opportunity should be made electronically in the body of or as an attachment to an email sent to Rhett.A.Herrera@nasa.gov.

<SUBJECT>16 -- Wheel Speed & Hubcap Assembly
<DESC>Description:	The function of the entire assembly is to sense wheel speed at landing to prevent skid on a runway by communicating with an on-board control unit that monitors brake application pressure.  Other salient characteristics are described below:

Two wheel-speed transducers provide individual wheel velocity measurement for each of the braked wheels. The transducers have axle adapters to allow them to be mounted inside the axles.  The transducer-adapter assembly is secured by threaded fasteners protruding through the axle and castellated wheel axle nuts.  The transducer shaft extends from the transducer toward the hubcap.  On the shaft, a drive coupling is installed, which is driven by the hubcap drive mechanism.  The field-proven hubcap-transducer drive interface is of sufficient rotational stiffness and strength to prevent transmission of erroneous wheel-speed velocity signals.  The coupling design can accommodate angular and parallel misalignment and axial assembly tolerance without degradation such as premature bearing or drive coupling wear.  The transducer is a variable reluctance alternator with 36 poles (teeth) on the rotor with 36 matching poles (teeth) on the stator.  The magnetic field is provided by a coaxial coil energized by the control unit transducer bias current.  With the excitation applied, a static magnetic field is established between the north and south poles of the rotor, air gap, stator and return path iron of the transducer, and no output is produced.  As the wheel rotates, rotor teeth pass the stator slots and teeth, causing variations in the reluctance of the magnetic circuit, which causes a change in the flux linking the coil.  The transducer output is, therefore, a sinusoidally varying voltage, with a frequency directly proportional to wheel rotational velocity.

Transducer Weight:  The weight of the wheel-speed transducer is 1.1 pounds.  The weight will be further defined after final axle adapter design.  The transducer weight does not include the weight of the hubcap, which is included in the total system weight estimate.  The proposed wheel-speed transducer is similar to Hydro-Aire 36-tooth wheel-speed transducers used on numerous commercial, business and military aircraft.

<SUBJECT>--The U.S. Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command (RDECOM) is sponsoring a Technology Readiness Evaluation (TRE 06-01) of advanced technologies to detect biological agents in water.
<DESC>For additional information e-mail jatraino@apgea.army.mil and daniel.nowak@us.army.mil. The U.S. Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command (RDECOM) is sponsoring a Technology Readiness Evaluation (TRE 06-01) of advanced technologies to dete ct biological agents in water.  A TRE test is planned in the third quarter of FY 2006 at a Bio Safety Level 3 (BSL 3) laboratory.  Vendors with a proven system that has demonstrated the capability to detect biological agents in various water sources are en couraged to respond to this opportunity (As a minimum, the submitted technology/system must be able to detect Ricin and Anthrax in the two water sources described below). Companies outside the United States are welcome to submit proposals.  Plans are underway to conduct the biological detection TRE in two phases. Phase I of TRE 06-01 will consist of a review of white paper proposals (Due on March 20, 2006) followed by a determination of eligibility of water monitoring systems to proceed and participate in the Phase II test program.  Selected vendors will be notifie d in March 2006 and shall be prepared to make a technical presentation of their technology in April 2006 (Industry Days).  Vendors will be required to present their system to a Government panel one-on-one and no other vendors will be present.  Information provided by vendors will be safeguarded. 1.   Presentations will be prepared using Microsoft Power Point, 10 paper copies and an electronic copy of the presentation shall be provided to the review panel prior to the start of the briefing.  The Edgewood Chemical Biological Center, RDECOM TRE Team will coordinate the schedule of vendor presentations and location (TBD) and provide notification to vendors. 2.   White paper proposal organization and content are as follow:  System Nomenclature/Title, Detailed System Description, Technology Employed, Agents of Biological Origin Detected, Limits of Detection, Interference Rejection Capability, Physical Propertie s, Power Requirements, Procedures for System Operations and Safety Precautions, Auxiliary Support Equipment (if any), Performance Test Data (including test reports), Commercial Applications of System and Logistical Requirements.  Provide information on any  unique test procedures, equipment, or facilities required for operation of your system.  The white paper proposal shall not exceed 10 pages, excluding any supporting data and test reports attached as appendices to the white paper. 3.   In addition to the white paper submission, a separate one page summary of the components is required that will potentially be exposed to biological agents during testing and the cost of replacement for these components.  Also provide the replacement c ost of the entire system that potentially may be exposed to Biological Warfare Agents (BWA).  To be responsive to this announcement, developers/sponsors must supply their proposal in hardcopy and a CD-ROM copy to U.S. Army Research, Development and Enginee ring Command (RDECOM), 5183 Blackhawk Road ATTN: AMSRD-ECB-RT-DE (Daniel M. Nowak),  Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD 21010, no later than close of business 20 March 2006.  Email submissions will be accepted in addition, but not in place of the written submissi ons.  Vendors are asked to provide an electronic photo of their system not imbedded in the white paper, but concurrent with the white paper proposals on the CD-ROM.  Commercial applications of vendor hardware should be revealed as well.  Request vendors in dicate the name of the Point of Contact (POC) for your company, as well as the telephone number, FAX number, email and complete mailing address. 4.   Proposals received will be considered proprietary and will be protected. B.   Phase II is a two part laboratory test of the hardware technology of down-selected vendors to meet performance criteria using daily prepared liquid samples diluted in either a formulated tap water or reverse osmosis water. 1.   Phase II (Part 1) testi ng will be conducted in a BSL 1 or 2 facility and will consist of daily prepared samples of killed, Bacillius anthracis, Ricin, Staphyococcus Enterotoxin B (SEB), and a non traditional biological agent found in water.  The samples will be in formulated tap  water and reverse osmosis water, chlorinated and nonchlorinated.  Three approximate concentration levels ranging from 10 to the power of three to 10 to the power of five cfu/ml, or ng/ml are planned. (a.)   Vendors will be notified when and where to submit a written request for Government Furnished Materials consisting of antibodies and antigens listed above. (b.)   The tests will be conducted in a Biological Safety Laboratory (BSL) 2 level facility in order to down select the most promising technologies to proceed to Part 2 testing with live agents.  The Government will provide notification to vendors down sel ected.  Vendors will have a technical representative on call to be contacted in the event of equipment problems that are in need of repair.  2.   Phase II Part 2 testing will be conducted in a BSL 3 and will consist of three (3) each Biological Warfare Agents (BWA) and one non-traditional biological agent. (a.)   The test samples will be a biological agent with or without interferents in chlorinated or nonchlorinated water and blanks.  The water sources will be either a formulated tap water or reverse osmosis water. (b.)   The concentration range of the BWA test samples will be tailored and range from 10 to the power of three to 10 to the power of five cfu/ml or ng/ml.  The water source may or may not contain chlorine. (c.)   Participating vendors technology and their equipment will be evaluated primarily based on the performance of their system to detect all samples presented with minimal false positive and false negative responses recorded. (d.)   Vendors are advised that the Government does not warrant that all components of a vendors system will be 100 percent decontaminated.  Therefore, those components or systems not decontaminated 100 percent will be retained and destroyed by the labora tory.  The Government will prepare and provide certification of destruction to each vendor.  Prior to the start of the Phase II (Part 2) testing, compensation will be negotiated in the event partial or 100 percent of vendors equipment is to be destroyed. (e.)	Since the government will be conducting the testing in a BL3 laboratory, vendors will be required to provide training and equipment manuals on the operation of their system as part of their submission and is a condition for participation in Phase II t esting. The U.S. Army is under no obligation to select any participating technologies.  TRE 06-01 will offer participants an opportunity to obtain unique performance data that will be shared with each vendor privately and can be used in their development work. The  U.S. Army will take the necessary precautions to safeguard vendors proprietary information provided as part of this evaluation.  The U.S. Army is not responsible for any costs (other than pre-negotiated costs for replacement of contaminated components or  items) incurred by the participants as a result of participating in this TRE. 3.

The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

Price

Technical and delivery, when combined, are ____N/A______when compared to price.

A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer’s specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

PROMPT PAYMENT TERMS

The vendor will provide prompt payment discount terms in their proposal.

INVOICING INSTRUCTIONS

A. Systems Submission of Invoices. 

 Invoice submission is a two step process:

The Vendor shall develop an Acceptance Information document in IT Solutions Shop (ITSS) and attach a copy of invoice with all required back-up documentation.

     Current ITSS web site https://it-solutions.gsa.gov

The Vendor shall also complete the invoice form on the Finance web site and attach soft copy of invoice.  This is the official system of record; the invoice will not be processed for payment unless this process is completed.  

     Current General Services Administration (GSA) Finance web site is www.finance.gsa.gov.  Go to
    http://finance.gsa.gov/password/ to obtain Password/Sign-Up for Email Notification.

B. Invoice Submission Process.

·	Submit each invoice only once.  Submitting multiple copies confuses and delays processing.

·	If editing is required, update the first submission; don’t create a second invoice submission.

·	Make sure the invoice amount and the acceptance document amount are the same.

·	Use the invoice number for both the Finance and ITSS submission.  Don’t use voucher numbers.  Always enter the invoice number on the Acceptance document in ITSS.  The invoice number must be identical in both sites.

·	Do not use special characters in the invoice number, only alpha and/or numeric.  No spaces in invoice number.

·	If an invoice is rejected, a corrected invoice will be submitted using the original invoice number with some type of unique identifier attached; i.e. “R” to denote resubmission which will make the invoice number unique.  Each invoice submission must have an invoice number that is unique.

·	In addition, the contractor is responsible for ensuring client acceptance of invoice. This can be accomplished in ITSS or contractor may have client sign a hard copy of invoice prior to attaching to the Acceptance Information document in ITSS.

·	Invoice must be submitted in ITSS on Acceptance Information document and include copy of invoice and required back-up attached.

C. Timing of invoices.

Invoices shall be submitted for payment of deliverables that have been completed and accepted by the Contracting Officer Representative (COR).

For Firm Fixed Price (FFP), this will be a completed and accepted deliverable.  Evidence that the COR accepted the deliverable must be present before the GSA Project Manager (PM) can proceed.  Ensure the invoice is submitted in accordance with the established payment schedule.  

For Time and Material (T&M), this will be a month’s worth of services.  The COR will certify that the contractor has performed in accordance with the statement of work and the government has received the hours and/or materials billed by the contractor.  Ensure the requirements of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.232-7, Payments under Time-and-Materials and Labor-Hour Contracts, are fully complied with.  GSA PM will certify the invoice for payment.

D. Payment of Invoices.

Payment of invoices shall be based on the quality of the invoiced deliverable.  If the invoiced deliverable does not meet the established contractual standards, the invoice will not be paid until the deliverable has been determined to meet the established standards, as applicable.

	The contractor is reminded that invoices will be submitted In accordance with (IAW) FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions – Commercial Items, paragraph g, which states the following:  
52.212-4(g) Invoice.

(x) Electronic funds transfer (EFT) banking information.
(A) The Contractor shall include EFT banking information on the invoice only if required elsewhere in this contract.
(B) If EFT banking information is not required to be on the invoice, in order for the invoice to be a proper invoice, the Contractor shall have submitted correct EFT banking information in accordance with the applicable solicitation provision, contract clause (e.g., 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer—Central Contractor Registration, or 52.232-34, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer—Other Than Central Contractor Registration), or applicable agency procedures.
(C) EFT banking information is not required if the Government waived the requirement to pay by EFT.
(2) Invoices will be handled in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C. 3903) and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR part 1315

The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:

Price

Technical and delivery, when combined, are ____N/A______when compared to price.

PROMPT PAYMENT TERMS

The vendor will provide prompt payment discount terms in their proposal.

INVOICING INSTRUCTIONS

A. Systems Submission of Invoices. 

 Invoice submission is a two step process:

The Vendor shall develop an Acceptance Information document in IT Solutions Shop (ITSS) and attach a copy of invoice with all required back-up documentation.

     Current ITSS web site https://it-solutions.gsa.gov

The Vendor shall also complete the invoice form on the Finance web site and attach soft copy of invoice.  This is the official system of record; the invoice will not be processed for payment unless this process is completed.  

     Current General Services Administration (GSA) Finance web site is www.finance.gsa.gov.  Go to
    http://finance.gsa.gov/password/ to obtain Password/Sign-Up for Email Notification.

B. Invoice Submission Process.

·	Submit each invoice only once.  Submitting multiple copies confuses and delays processing.

·	If editing is required, update the first submission; don’t create a second invoice submission.

·	Make sure the invoice amount and the acceptance document amount are the same.

·	Use the invoice number for both the Finance and ITSS submission.  Don’t use voucher numbers.  Always enter the invoice number on the Acceptance document in ITSS.  The invoice number must be identical in both sites.

·	Do not use special characters in the invoice number, only alpha and/or numeric.  No spaces in invoice number.

·	If an invoice is rejected, a corrected invoice will be submitted using the original invoice number with some type of unique identifier attached; i.e. “R” to denote resubmission which will make the invoice number unique.  Each invoice submission must have an invoice number that is unique.

·	In addition, the contractor is responsible for ensuring client acceptance of invoice. This can be accomplished in ITSS or contractor may have client sign a hard copy of invoice prior to attaching to the Acceptance Information document in ITSS.

·	Invoice must be submitted in ITSS on Acceptance Information document and include copy of invoice and required back-up attached.

C. Timing of invoices.

Invoices shall be submitted for payment of deliverables that have been completed and accepted by the Contracting Officer Representative (COR).

For Firm Fixed Price (FFP), this will be a completed and accepted deliverable.  Evidence that the COR accepted the deliverable must be present before the GSA Project Manager (PM) can proceed.  Ensure the invoice is submitted in accordance with the established payment schedule.  

For Time and Material (T&M), this will be a month’s worth of services.  The COR will certify that the contractor has performed in accordance with the statement of work and the government has received the hours and/or materials billed by the contractor.  Ensure the requirements of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.232-7, Payments under Time-and-Materials and Labor-Hour Contracts, are fully complied with.  GSA PM will certify the invoice for payment.

D. Payment of Invoices.

Payment of invoices shall be based on the quality of the invoiced deliverable.  If the invoiced deliverable does not meet the established contractual standards, the invoice will not be paid until the deliverable has been determined to meet the established standards, as applicable.

	The contractor is reminded that invoices will be submitted In accordance with (IAW) FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions – Commercial Items, paragraph g, which states the following:  
52.212-4(g) Invoice. 
(1) The Contractor shall submit an original invoice and three copies (or electronic invoice, if authorized) to the address designated in the contract to receive invoices. An invoice must include --

(vii) Name and address of official to whom payment is to be sent;
(viii) Name, title, and phone number of person to notify in event of defective invoice; and
(ix) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN). The Contractor shall include its TIN on the invoice only if required elsewhere in this contract.
(x) Electronic funds transfer (EFT) banking information.
(A) The Contractor shall include EFT banking information on the invoice only if required elsewhere in this contract.
(B) If EFT banking information is not required to be on the invoice, in order for the invoice to be a proper invoice, the Contractor shall have submitted correct EFT banking information in accordance with the applicable solicitation provision, contract clause (e.g., 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer—Central Contractor Registration, or 52.232-34, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer—Other Than Central Contractor Registration), or applicable agency procedures.
(C) EFT banking information is not required if the Government waived the requirement to pay by EFT.
(2) Invoices will be handled in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C. 3903) and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR part 1315

PROMPT PAYMENT TERMS

INVOICING INSTRUCTIONS

A. Systems Submission of Invoices. 

 Invoice submission is a two step process:

The Vendor shall develop an Acceptance Information document in IT Solutions Shop (ITSS) and attach a copy of invoice with all required back-up documentation.

     Current ITSS web site https://it-solutions.gsa.gov

The Vendor shall also complete the invoice form on the Finance web site and attach soft copy of invoice.  This is the official system of record; the invoice will not be processed for payment unless this process is completed.  

     Current General Services Administration (GSA) Finance web site is www.finance.gsa.gov.  Go to
    http://finance.gsa.gov/password/ to obtain Password/Sign-Up for Email Notification.

B. Invoice Submission Process.

·	Submit each invoice only once.  Submitting multiple copies confuses and delays processing.

·	If editing is required, update the first submission; don’t create a second invoice submission.

·	Make sure the invoice amount and the acceptance document amount are the same.

·	Use the invoice number for both the Finance and ITSS submission.  Don’t use voucher numbers.  Always enter the invoice number on the Acceptance document in ITSS.  The invoice number must be identical in both sites.

·	Do not use special characters in the invoice number, only alpha and/or numeric.  No spaces in invoice number.

·	If an invoice is rejected, a corrected invoice will be submitted using the original invoice number with some type of unique identifier attached; i.e. “R” to denote resubmission which will make the invoice number unique.  Each invoice submission must have an invoice number that is unique.

·	In addition, the contractor is responsible for ensuring client acceptance of invoice. This can be accomplished in ITSS or contractor may have client sign a hard copy of invoice prior to attaching to the Acceptance Information document in ITSS.

·	Invoice must be submitted in ITSS on Acceptance Information document and include copy of invoice and required back-up attached.

C. Timing of invoices.

Invoices shall be submitted for payment of deliverables that have been completed and accepted by the Contracting Officer Representative (COR).

For Firm Fixed Price (FFP), this will be a completed and accepted deliverable.  Evidence that the COR accepted the deliverable must be present before the GSA Project Manager (PM) can proceed.  Ensure the invoice is submitted in accordance with the established payment schedule.  

For Time and Material (T&M), this will be a month’s worth of services.  The COR will certify that the contractor has performed in accordance with the statement of work and the government has received the hours and/or materials billed by the contractor.  Ensure the requirements of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.232-7, Payments under Time-and-Materials and Labor-Hour Contracts, are fully complied with.  GSA PM will certify the invoice for payment.

D. Payment of Invoices.

Payment of invoices shall be based on the quality of the invoiced deliverable.  If the invoiced deliverable does not meet the established contractual standards, the invoice will not be paid until the deliverable has been determined to meet the established standards, as applicable.

	The contractor is reminded that invoices will be submitted In accordance with (IAW) FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions – Commercial Items, paragraph g, which states the following:  
52.212-4(g) Invoice.

(x) Electronic funds transfer (EFT) banking information.
(A) The Contractor shall include EFT banking information on the invoice only if required elsewhere in this contract.

(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:

(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.

(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

HSAR 3052-70, PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [DEC 2003]   [Full Text Follows]
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent' for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  "Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.  (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears.

    (1)  The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held— 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296.

    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107–296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships, which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights.

    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled, as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835. 
    (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107–296 of November 25, 2002.

OMBUDSMAN NOTICE – NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.    Informal forum with the Ombudsman.    Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D.

The Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) assigned rating is not applicable to this acquisition.  Applicable numbered notes: 1.      STATEMENT OF WORK. BACKGROUND: The Office of Human Resources (OHR) at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA and/or Agency) is in the midst of developing and implementing a Strategic Workforce Plan (SWP).  Workforce planning supports the President?s Management Agenda for the federal government that is being overseen by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).  The SWP Model for the EPA has four competency-based parts: Demand, Supply, Gap Analysis, Gap Closure Strategies and Solutions.  A competency assessment tool is an integral part of the Supply component of the model.   As EPA supervisors learn to look ahead to determine how the Agency?s mission is changing and forecast what those changes mean in terms of workforce competencies necessary to meet those changing needs (i.e., Demand), they will then need to understand what their existing workforce competencies are (i.e., Supply) in order to determine if there is a competency ?gap,? (i.e., Gap Analysis).  If there is a gap, then the size and type of gap will indicate the appropriate response (i.e., Gap Closure Strategy).  Since the EPA has over 17,000 employees in more than 200 occupations, 18 ?mission critical occupations? (or MCO?s) have been identified to focus workforce planning efforts.  To launch this competency-based approach to workforce planning, the EPA has chosen one MCO, Leadership, to start.  Specifically, the EPA will test the waters with a competency Supply assessment of its Senior Executive Service (SES) members.   PURPOSE: The purpose of this Statement of Work (SOW) is to describe the need for an ?instrument? or ?tool? to help with the ?Supply? part of the workforce planning process for Leadership competencies.  The EPA has identified the core competencies for Leaders.  REQUIREMENT: The Agency needs a tool provider who can deliver a robust assessment of the strengths and development opportunities in leadership competencies and related behaviors for up to 350 SES employees.   TASKS: 1) Online Leadership Competency Assessment Tool. Due to the nature of these Agency individuals, the tool provided must not require inordinate amounts of time to use (90 minutes or less); it must be a self assessment or limited multi-rater tool; it must be convenient to use (on line availability and accessible for multiple sessions); the rating scale must be easily mapped to the OPM 5-Level proficiency scale (Awareness, Basic, Intermediate, Advanced and Expert); and the tool must be reliable, valid, and offer normative comparisons with like populations.  2) The contractor shall collect and compile the results/data from use of the tool.  The contractor shall provide a written SES Assessment Analysis Report of the results/data to the Project Officer.  3) The contractor shall provide a written Individual Analysis Report of the results from the individual?s assessment to each SES employee.   4) The contractor shall provide a personal coaching/feedback session (e.g., by telephone) on what the results mean for each SES employee (not to exceed 60 minutes).  The session shall include, at a minimum, actionable ideas and/or suggestions.  The contractor shall provide a written Personal Coaching/Feedback Session and Report to each SES employee.  5) The tool provider shall develop a Comprehensive Analysis and Summary Report that analyzes the aggregate result data for trends and conclusions.  The report shall be delivered to the Project Officer. DELIVERABLES: Online Leadership Competency Assessment Tool, Due Date: February 24, 2006; 2) SES Assessment Analysis Report, Due Date: March 17, 2006; 3) Individual Analysis Report, Due Date: March 24, 2006; 4) Personal Coaching/Feedback Session and Report, Due Date: March 31, 2006; 5) Comprehensive Analysis and Summary Report, Due Date: April 15, 2006.  POINT OF CONTACT: The EPA Project Officer will be Jeff Bryant, Strategic Human Capital Planning Team, Human Capital Planning and Policy Division, U.S. EPA, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave, N.W., Mail Code 3632-M, Washington, DC 20460.

The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be the most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The Government intends to evaluate offers and make award without discussions.  The following three factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Technical Capability, Past Experience/Performance, and Price.  These three evaluation criteria will be of equal importance.  The Government will evaluate offers for both amount of experience with similar contracts and quality of performance. 1) TECHNICAL CAPABILITY.  Technical capability will be evaluated by how well the proposed services meet the agency?s requirement.  A technical evaluation may include, but not be limited to, the amount and nature of the work your company has performed; examination of such things as product literature, technical features and warranty provisions.  2) PAST PERFORMANCE.  Refers to how well your company has performed the work.  The Government will evaluate the submitted past performance information required by FAR provision 52.212-1 and may use information from other sources to review offerors ability to perform the contract successfully.  Required past performance information:  Offerors shall submit three (3) references of relevant contracts performed within the last five years (past and/or present), that are the same and/or similar to the size and complexity of this requirement. For each reference include the contract number, dollar value, contract office, agency name, contact numbers, period of performance, contracting officer?s name, telephone and fax numbers for each contract, customer name and phone number and description of service.  Past performance data does not have to be through a government agency.  The offeror should not describe past performance history in their offer. The information should include, however, discussion of any major problems encountered on the contracts listed and the corrective actions taken to resolve them. The information may also include a description of any quality awards earned by the offeror.  Offerors lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. However, the offer of a company with no relevant past performance history, while not rated favorably or unfavorably for past performance, may not represent the most advantageous offer to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful offer when compared to the responses of other offerors.  The offeror should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  The assessment of the offeror?s past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the responder and other competitors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFP.  The Government will give greater consideration to the contracts that the Government feels are most relevant to the RFP.  All references shall be available to respond with a reply within 36 hours after being contacted. 3) PRICE.  Offerors shall propose: 1) An individual price for each task area and associated deliverable; and 2) An aggregate price for the requirement.  The Offeror agrees to comply with the FAR provisions and clauses included in the combined synopsis/solicitation and resulting contract by reference to implement a provision of law applicable to acquisitions of commercial items or components.  Offerors must scrutinize this solicitation and ensure their offer complies with all requirements.  It is not sufficient to merely state your offer complies with this solicitation requirements.  You must clearly identify how your offer meets all solicitation requirements.

The Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Affymetrix, for Custom Gene Chips, in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Submit offers on NOI-RML #6007. The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-08 dated 1/5/06, and 2005-07(b) dated 2/2/06. This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a Small Business Set-Aside.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541710 and the small business size is 500.  SCHEDULE:  The Rocky Mountain Laboratories, (RML),performs basic research contributing to the development of diagnostic reagents, therapeutics and vaccines against human bacterial pathogens. Purchase of  55(fifty-five) Affymetrix microarray Mouse genome chips containing oligonucleotide sequences representing the mouse genome will assist towards achieving those goals. The RTS has a need to purchase Affymetrix GCS 3000 workstation-compatible Mouse genome chips for protocol optimization, development and use in RML microarray experiments. This is a 6(six) week, one time work effort, where the final product will be 55(fifty-five) Mouse genome expression arrays containing oligo pairs at high density, specific to all known and identified Mouse genes.  The contractor shall have the appropriate proprietary rights to design and manufacture these chemical reagent, consumable chips. These chips shall be compatible with the Affymetrix fluidics and hybridization station and scanner.  The design and manufacturing process of this mouse gene chip is wholly patented and owned by Affymetrix. The chip shall be high density,  at 106 per cm2 or greater (USPNos. 5445934 and 5744305).  The Mouse GeneChip® shall be made by photolithography manufacturing technology (USPNos. 5424186, 5510270), developed solely by Affymetrix.  The mouse  GeneChip® probe array must enable identification of 2-fold or greater levels of change in expression levels, and detection of as little as 1 mRNA transcript in a complex mixture of 100,000.  The GeneChip® probe array must contain multiple unique probes designed to be Perfect Match (PM), 25-mer oligonucleotide probe pairs, to represent each mRNA transcript (full length gene) tested, and multiple probes designed to be Mis-Match (MM), to enable calibration of non-specific hybridization data (USPNos.5527681). Additional control sequences (yeast and commensal) must also be available on the chip for hybridization control, and housekeeping gene analysis.

<DESC>Question 1: 
The RFP stated that the General session will take place all day. Will the breakout spaces also be needed all day as well? Are you flexible on the number of breakouts you'll need? 

Answer 1: It is anticipated that a General session will be held only on the first day (May 2nd) of the conference so no breakout rooms would be necessary that day. Breakout rooms would be needed on the second day (May 3rd) so a room to accommodate a General session would not be needed on this day. It appears at this time that the agency will need a minimum of four (4) breakout rooms but may need as many as six (6) which allows limited flexibility on the number of breakout rooms.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested by this notice alone, and a written solicitation will not be issued. This synopsis/solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotations for pickup trucks to be used by the Government of Bolivia pursuant to an agreement with the U.S. Department of State. 


1.0.       DESCRIPTION

The U.S. Department of State, Narcotics Affairs Section (NAS) of the U.S. Embassy in La Paz, Bolivia has a requirement for the procurement of up to 90 new pickup trucks to replace old equipment and to allow for an expansion of     NAS support to counternarcotics operations in Bolivia. The primary use of the vehicles will be for the transportation of personnel and supplies to support these operations. The vehicles must be suitable for extensive travel in rural areas and smaller cities and towns, where deeply rutted and unpaved roads are the norm. They must also be suitable for travel to remote and mountainous regions, which are accessible only by difficult-to-drive, twisting, narrow and unpaved roads that border on 3,000 to 5,000 foot drops. The vehicles will also be used for travel to densely forested areas and must be dependable in heavy mud, which is often encountered during rainy season.


The vehicle offered must be capable of being maintained commercially in Bolivia in locations far from the main urban areas and must be covered by the manufacturer’s warranties. Quoters must demonstrate that the vehicles offered can withstand continuous use in Bolivia’s extremely rugged terrain and harsh climatic conditions, and that the vehicles are cost-effective to operate and maintain. The supplied vehicles are to be “new,” which is defined as “having zero miles.” Low mileage and/or demonstration models are not considered to be new.     Delivery of anything other than new vehicles shall be rejected and returned at no cost to the Government. The resulting contract type shall be firm-fixed price.


2.0.       PRICING
       
The Contractor shall provide the vehicles at the firm-fixed price established below. 


Line Item No. 0001: Pickup Truck, Quantity: Up to 90, provide quotation showing unit price and total maximum price, including all features listed below, priced in U.S. dollars.


The above price is in terms of “Cost, Insurance and Freight” (CIF), with final delivery to be made at the Duty Free Zone at Customs in La Paz, Bolivia. The vehicles shall be insured by the Contractor until such time as the vehicles are received by NAS in La Paz.  The Embassy will clear and title the vehicles.


This purchase order will be a firm-fixed-price, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity type. 


3.0.       PAYMENT

Delivery of the total maximum quantity of 90 vehicles maximum shall be made in two separate deliveries as specified in Part 5.0. below (Period of Performance).


The Contractor may invoice after completion of each of the two deliveries. Payments will not be made for partial quantities delivered.

The vehicles are expected to operate on primary roads, secondary roads, cross country terrain and trails, as well as in deteriorated urban environments.


These vehicles will play a significant role in moving personnel and equipment from NAS support sites to remote locations, across terrain that is inaccessible by most vehicles. The vehicles must be able to negotiate steep hills, valleys and man-made objects that are typical of the obstacles encountered in their various operating environments. The vehicle must provide sufficient traction, as well as adequate balance and safety (in terms of overturning and/or straining the power train). It is of the utmost importance that the vehicles provide a stable and safe platform for moving equipment and personnel into and out of operation areas. In addition to transporting equipment and personnel, the vehicles may be used by security personnel patrolling remote areas in a force protection role, and the vehicles must be capable of being deployed quickly in response to threats.
