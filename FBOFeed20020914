Offerors shall include with their quotations a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3 – Offeror Representations and Certifications – Commercial Items.  The provision at FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation – Commercial Items is applicable to this solicitation.  The following evaluation factors will be used to evaluate offeror’s quotation, and are listed in the relative descending order of importance:  (1) technical capabi lity of the system offered to meet the Government requirement; (2) past performance and (3) price.  Product literature shall be provided with the quotation and will be evaluated as part of the technical capabilities by the Government.  The Government will evaluate the quality of the offeror’s past/present performance and the assessment of past/present  performance will be used in two ways.   The assessment of the  offeror’s performance will be used as one means of evaluating the credibility of the offer’s quotation.  A record of marginal or unacceptable past or present performance may be considered an indication that the representations made by the offeror are less  than reliable.  Such an indication may be reflected in the overall assessment of the offeror’s quotation.  Second, the assessment of the offeror’s past or present performance will be used as one means of evaluating the relative capability of the offeror a nd the other competitors to meet the performance requirements of the proposed contract.  Thus, an offeror with an exceptional record of past/present performance may receive a more favorable evaluation than another whose record is acceptable, even though bo th may have otherwise equally acceptable proposals.  In investigating an offeror’s past/present  performance, the Government will consider information from past and present customers, both inside and outside the Federal Government.  Past/present performanc e data in the form of a questionnaire will be solicited from three sources selected by this office.  Evaluation of past performance will be a subjective assessment based on a consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances.  It will not be used on ab solute standards of acceptable performance.  The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely delivery of quality goods and services, of similar kind and complexity, a t fair and reasonable prices.  This is a matter of judgment.  Offerors may be given an opportunity to address especially unfavorable reports of past performance, and the offeror’s response or lack thereof will be taken into consideration.  By past/present performance, the Government means the offeror’s record of conforming to Government specification requirements and to standards of good workmanship; the offeror’s reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; an d generally, the offeror’s business-like concern for the interests of the customer.  Clause 52.212-5 (Dev) Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders – Commercial Items is hereby incorporated by reference.  In addition , the following clauses are applicable and incorporated by reference:  52.222-21 Prohibition of Segregated Facilities, 52.222-26 Equal Opportunity, 52.222-35 Affirmative Action for Disabled Veterans of the Vietnam Era, 52.222-36 Affirmative Action for Work ers with Disabilities, 52.222-37 Employment Reports on Disabled Veterans and Veterans of the Vietnam Era, and 52.232-36 Payment by Third Party.  The following DFAR clauses are incorporated by reference:  252.204-7004 Required Central Contractor Registratio n, 252.212-7001 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Applicable to Defense Acquisitions to Commercial Items, and 252.225-7001 Buy American Act and Balance of Payment Program.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce/NOAA, Eastern Administrative Support Center intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the States of Massachusetts, Maine, Rhode Island, and New Hampshire for an industry based survey of Atlantic Cod and yellowtail flounder distribution.  Congressional emphasis has been placed on the development and full implementation of partnerships in cooperative research with the commercial fishing industry, conservation organizations, and State Marine Fisheries agencies.  The Commonwealth of Massachusetts has been charged with the management of marine resources with the coastal waters in the GOM and Southern New England.  Similarly, the states of New Hampshire, Maine, and Rhode Island are responsible for management of their respective resources in near shore areas.  The scope of this effort shall be to assist the National Marine Fisheries Service in the development, coordination and implementation of a pilot industry-based fleet to investigate and implement various methods of improving the Government's fishery independent data collection using commercial harvesting vessels.  The program objective is to define a broad scale distribution of cod aggregations in the Gulf of Maine, in a temporal and spatial scale sufficient for management purposes, by age and size composition.  The effort will also document and re-evaluate the SNE yellowtail flounder abundance, size frequencies and size relative to age and growth, population distribution, predator/prey relations, reproductive capacity and oceanographic conditions that influence larval fish retention, and further study essential habitat of the flounder and  their movement in and out of these habitats.  This action is estimated above the simplified acquisition threshold.  The statutory authority is 41 USC253(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source.

<DESC>The National Weather Service/Office of Hydrologic Development located at Silver Spring, MD has the following requirement.  The period of performance is for a total of 3 years, 1 Base Year with 2 1-year Options.

Objectives

There are two primary objectives:  (1) Develop innovative, operational, real-time rainfall analysis techniques using WSR-88D data that will generate ensembles of rainfall products that provide most-likely rainfall estimates and associated uncertainty information. The techniques should use WSR-88D data as their primary input and should not be dependent on the availability or density of rain gauge or satellite rainfall data. These techniques could be extensions of existing NWS radar-only techniques such as the PPS or could be new ones based on dual-polarized radar data. The techniques must be robust enough so that single-polarized reflectivity data and/or dual-polarized radar data could be used as input since both forms of radar data will be available from the WSR-88D in the near future. In either case, the proposed techniques must be efficient and robust enough to be viable in the
real-time operational environment of the NWS and must be able to be implemented within NWS WSR-88D computer systems and infrastructure. The procedures and products are expected to be validated against rain gauge data or other comparable rainfall sources in a variety of rainfall regimes across the topographically diverse U.S. in all four seasons.  (2) Develop innovative techniques based on human factors considerations to display this quantitative information to users that are both intuitive and informative, yet not overwhelming.

Deliverables

First-year deliverables include a written report from the contractor proposing and evaluating one or more possible techniques for generating ensemble or probabilistic radar rainfall estimates. This report should include a review of existing NWS QPE techniques such as stated above to assure the contractor understands the scope of current capabilities. Semiannual progress reports are required.

If the proposed techniques are judged by the NWS to be operationally viable and scientifically valid after NWS review of the year-1 report, development of the techniques can proceed in the second year with availability of funding. Semiannual progress reports are required.

The final deliverable at the end of the third year with availability of funding will be an operational prototype algorithm, including software and documentation, that can be implemented within existing NWS systems. Semiannual progress reports are required.

The proposals will be evaluated based on the following factors:  Past Performance, Knowledge of real-time rainfall analysis techniques, Knowledge of display techniques, and cost.  All factors will be weighted equally.

<DESC>SPAWAR Request For Proposal (RFP) N00039-02-R-0025 for the Teleport Management and Control Segment (TMCS) was issued 11 September 2002.  The solicitation is available for immediate download at the SPAWAR E-Commerce Central website at http://e-commerce.spawar.navy.mil.  The date and time for receipt of proposals is Tuesday, 15 October 2002, 1500 PST. ________________________________________ The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR), PMW-179, intends to issue a Request For Proposal (RFP) under full and open competition for the design, fabrication, installation, integration, test, documentation, and support for a Teleport Management and Control Segment (TMCS) consisting of hardware, software and networking components at the six worldwide Teleport sites located at Ft. Buckner Japan, Lago di Patria Italy, Wahiawa Hawaii, Camp Roberts California, Ramstein AFB Germany, Northwest (Norfolk) Virginia. The mission of the DoD Teleport program is to provide worldwide deployed warfighters the expanded communications capability, centralized integration capability, contingency capacity, and the necessary interfaces (satellite and terrestrial) to access the Defense Information Systems Network (DISN) in a seamless, interoperable and economical manner.  The TMCS is an integral part of meeting the mission. The TMCS capability will minimize the amount of hands-on labor required by Teleport personnel.  Control will be maintained through the use of computer terminals and a local area network (LAN).  The TMCS systems will expand with each Generation of Teleport to include the new capabilities added in each Generation. TMCS will allow for resource configuration and reconfiguration, system controller interfaces, nodal management and control for each Teleport component and Teleport status reporting to the Regional Network Operations and Security Centers (RNOSC). The TMCS will allow the Regional Network Operations and Security Center (RNOSC) to remotely monitor major Teleport functions via the Integrated Network Management System (INMS). SPAWAR anticipates the award of a contract with firm-fixed price, cost-plus fixed fee, and time and materials line items.  The period of performance will be one (1) base year and four (4) option years. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 511210.  The solicitation for this requirement is expected to be released on or about 9 September 2002.  The solicitation will be issued without further notice and will be available at the SPAWAR E-Commerce Central website at http://e-commerce.spawar.navy.mil.

<DESC>SPAWAR Request For Proposal (RFP) N00039-02-R-0025 for the Teleport Management and Control Segment (TMCS) was issued on 11 September 2002.  The solicitation is available for immediate download at the SPAWAR E-Commerce Central website at http://e-commerce.spawar.navy.mil.  The date and time for receipt of proposals is Tuesday, 15 October 2002, 1500 PST. _______________________________________ The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR), PMW-179, intends to issue a Request For Proposal (RFP) under full and open competition for the design, fabrication, installation, integration, test, documentation, and support for a Teleport Management and Control Segment (TMCS) consisting of hardware, software and networking components at the six worldwide Teleport sites located at Ft. Buckner Japan, Lago di Patria Italy, Wahiawa Hawaii, Camp Roberts California, Ramstein AFB Germany, Northwest (Norfolk) Virginia. The mission of the DoD Teleport program is to provide worldwide deployed warfighters the expanded communications capability, centralized integration capability, contingency capacity, and the necessary interfaces (satellite and terrestrial) to access the Defense Information Systems Network (DISN) in a seamless, interoperable and economical manner.  The TMCS is an integral part of meeting the mission. The TMCS capability will minimize the amount of hands-on labor required by Teleport personnel.  Control will be maintained through the use of computer terminals and a local area network (LAN).  The TMCS systems will expand with each Generation of Teleport to include the new capabilities added in each Generation. TMCS will allow for resource configuration and reconfiguration, system controller interfaces, nodal management and control for each Teleport component and Teleport status reporting to the Regional Network Operations and Security Centers (RNOSC). The TMCS will allow the Regional Network Operations and Security Center (RNOSC) to remotely monitor major Teleport functions via the Integrated Network Management System (INMS). SPAWAR anticipates the award of a contract with firm-fixed price, cost-plus fixed fee, and time and materials line items.  The period of performance will be one (1) base year and four (4) option years. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 511210.  The solicitation for this requirement is expected to be released on or about 9 September 2002.  The solicitation will be issued without further notice and will be available at the SPAWAR E-Commerce Central website at http://e-commerce.spawar.navy.mil. Points of contact for this requirement are Gil Field, Contracting Officer, (619)524-7162, gil.field@navy.mil and Stephen Beckner, Contract Specialist, (619)524-7389, stephen.beckner@navy.mil

<DESC>The National Weather Service/Office of Hydrologic Development located at Silver Spring, MD has the following requirement.  The period of performance is for a total of 3 years, 1 Base Year with 2 1-year Options.

Objectives:

There are two primary objectives:  (1) Develop innovative, operational, real-time rainfall analysis techniques using WSR-88D data that will generate ensembles of rainfall products that provide most-likely rainfall estimates and associated uncertainty information. The techniques should use WSR-88D data as their primary input and should not be dependent on the availability or density of rain gauge or satellite rainfall data. These techniques could be extensions of existing NWS radar-only techniques such as the PPS or could be new ones based on dual-polarized radar data. The techniques must be robust enough so that single-polarized reflectivity data and/or dual-polarized radar data could be used as input since both forms of radar data will be available from the WSR-88D in the near future. In either case, the proposed techniques must be efficient and robust enough to be viable in the
real-time operational environment of the NWS and must be able to be implemented within NWS WSR-88D computer systems and infrastructure. The procedures and products are expected to be validated against rain gauge data or other comparable rainfall sources in a variety of rainfall regimes across the topographically diverse U.S. in all four seasons.  (2) Develop innovative techniques based on human factors considerations to display this quantitative information to users that are both intuitive and informative, yet not overwhelming.

Deliverables:

First-year deliverables include a written report from the contractor proposing and evaluating one or more possible techniques for generating ensemble or probabilistic radar rainfall estimates. This report should include a review of existing NWS QPE techniques such as stated above to assure the contractor understands the scope of current capabilities. Semiannual progress reports are required.

If the proposed techniques are judged by the NWS to be operationally viable and scientifically valid after NWS review of the year-1 report, development of the techniques can proceed in the second year with availability of funding. Semiannual progress reports are required.

The final deliverable at the end of the third year with availability of funding will be an operational prototype algorithm, including software and documentation, that can be implemented within existing NWS systems. Semiannual progress reports are required.

The proposals will be evaluated based on the following factors:  Past Performance, Knowledge of real-time rainfall analysis techniques, Knowledge of display techniques, and cost.  All factors will be weighted equally.

If you are a interested responsible party that can produce the above solution, request you send an e-mail requesting a copy of the solicitation to the below Point of Contact.  The solicitation will be released about 5 days after the closing date of this announcement.

The officer in aviation service (including operational and non-operational aviation positions) or Government civilian in aviation service to whom the approving authority has delegated responsibility for approval of contractor flights, procedures, flight crewmember/personnel and ensuring contractor compliance with applicable provisions of the GFR Operating Procedures Manual.   COMBAT EQUIPPED JUMPER.  An aircraft passenger rigged with a main parachute, reserve parachute, weapon, and ALICE pack (back-pack) to parachute from an aircraft.  The planning weight for a combat equipped jumper is as follows:  Weight of average jumper = 180 lbs., Weight of parachute with reserve = 40 lbs., Weight of ALICE pack and weapon = 80 lbs.  Total Average Planning Weight per Combat Equipped Jumper = 300 lbs.  PARADROP EQUIPMENT BUNDLE.  These bundles are composed of equipment packed into a canvas container.  The maximum container dimensions are 30"x 66"x 48".  The bundle is dropped using a static line deployed parachute.  Bundles are rigged in such a manner that when placed on the balance point of the jump platform, the parachute is on the top of the bundle or on the side of the bundle facing the center of the aircraft, based on the largest dimension.  The maximum weight of the bundle is 500 lbs.   MESSAGE PICKUP (MPU) Operation. The MPU sites are selected to meet or exceed all ground and air selection considerations IAW TC 31-24.  The MPU operational procedures and techniques discussed below apply when using a STOL aircraft.  Aircrew shall be able to: Locate the PZ, and be able to identify the PZ, the authentication signals on the PZ, and both far and near recognition signals.  The reception committee must select an MPU that is accessible, secure, and safe.  Air considerations of Terrain: General area shall be relatively free of obstacles, flat or rolling terrain is preferred; however in mountainous terrain use large valleys, flat ridges, and level plateaus, avoid small pockets and valleys surrounded by obstacles such as tall trees and hilly terrain, very difficult for the pilot to locate, approach from any direction is preferred, or a minimum of 45 degrees open quadrant on approach and departure ends, MPU PZ having a single clear line of approach is acceptable provided there is a level turning radius of 2-kilometers/1 nautical mile.  Obstacles:  Terrain obstacles are rising ground or hills more than 153 meters (500 feet) higher than the PZ surface, should not be closer than 6 kilometers (3NM), and must be reported; artificial obstacles 90 meters (300 feet) in height above PZ level not on the issue map within a radius 5 NM must be reported; approach and takeoff clearance is based on the decent and ascent STOL aircraft ratio, or the so-called glide and climb ratio, 1 to 11 ratio, and also is the same ratio for mask clearance on MPU operations.  Size and surface area of the MPU site: MPU pickup zone is the safe area where the aircraft has descended to recovery altitude and is level, cleared to deploy the MPU retriever system, recover the MPU container from the MPU ground apparatus, and the aircraft initiates its ascent. The PZ area is the area where the ground committee places in the visual authentication marking system; the PZ minimum area in length is 92 meters (302 feet) and its minimum width is 23 meters (75 feet).  The PZ surface must be reasonably leveled, obstacle free, vegetation should not exceed 0.3 meters (1 foot).  In addition to the PZ length, mask clearance/ascent/descent ratio (1:11 for STOL aircraft) must be applied to the approach and departure ends in order to clear any obstacle surrounding the usable area.  MPU PZ shoulder safety zone is the area on both sides of the PZ's outer edge, parallel to the PZ's long axis (minimum length 92 meters) and is extended laterally an additional 24 meters (79 feet).  Its surface inside this given area must be clear of obstacles that exceed 1 meter.  The purpose of the two shoulder safety zones is to allow the pilot lateral maneuvers, free of obstacles, to prevent the retrieve anchor point from entanglement during his approach and departure of the MPU operation.  Additional ground consideration information is the surrounding area must be relatively free of obstacles to all a safe flight during approach and departure and to prevent entanglement of the retrieve hook and line.  6.
