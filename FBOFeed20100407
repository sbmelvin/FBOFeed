Proposals are being solicited for tailored logistics packages that, to the maximum practicable extent, will employ the techniques, advantages and economies of commercial business practices to reduce the total logistics cost to DSCP and its customers, and to provide rapid response, direct vendor delivery, advanced distribution, material management, total asset/in transit visibility, and information fusion, in response to, and in satisfaction of, DSCP's customers' demands. Therefore, to the maximum extent practicable, the contract(s) resulting from this solicitation will integrate the business practices of the commercial and military supply distribution systems. Tailored Logistics Support through this program will acquire a full line of logistic support of tent and shelter equipment of military installations, federal agencies, state and local governments, and other authorized customers located worldwide. The solicitation will encompass a wide spectrum of commercial tent and shelter equipment. Products are mobile, non-permanent shelters and soft-sided tents which can be readily assembled and disassembled in the field for troop movement.

<DESC>The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) plans to award a sole source purchase order to the Advant-Edge Paving Equipment LLC for the Advant-Edger Universal Paving model for the Safety Edge Loan program. Advant-Edge Paving Equipment LLC is the only sole source that can provide the Advant-Edger Universal model.  The Advant Edge shoe is a reversible paving shoe that can be used on both the right and left side of paving machines. The purpose of providing both left and right operation in one device is to facilitate creating the lane edge wedge fillet whether paving in the direction of traffic or paving against the traffic pattern. Therefore, only one unit is required to do both functions. This is a Simplified Acquisition and the anticipated award date is April 22, 2010.

<DESC>RECOVERY: The USDA Forest Service, Los Padres National Forest (hereafter "the Government," "the Forest Service," or "the Los Padres National Forest (NF)"), announces a design-build opportunity using funds from the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). This acquisition is being advertised as FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION and any resultant contract award will be issued pursuant to FAR Part 19, Subpart 19.10, Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program. In accordance with FAR Part 36.204(f), the estimated magnitude of construction is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000. Contract period of performance time is 18 months after the notice to proceed. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 236220. The Small Business Administration size standard is $33.5 million.

THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this synopsis, the pending solicitation or any follow up information requests. The solicitation with supporting documents (if any) will be posted to the FedBizOpps website on or about April 23, 2010. No hard copies of the solicitation, supporting documents and applicable amendments, if any will be provided. To receive the entire solicitation package and any applicable amendments, prospective offerors must download them from the FedBizOpps website. This acquisition is a Design-Build project and is prepared in accordance with the requirements set forth in FAR Part 36 and as authorized by Section 4105 of the Clinger-Cohen Act and will be supplemented with additional information included in the solicitation. The contractor shall provide all management and project administration services, quality control, logistical support, vehicles, equipment and materials to complete the project on time and on schedule. The project consists of the complete design and construction of a new approximately 8,000 square foot office building to replace several existing buildings at the Los Padres National Forest, Mt Pinos District Rangers Office located in Frazier Park, CA. Additionally, to accommodate the new facility, an existing 1,100 square foot modular unit will be renovated for use as a women's barracks to be completed prior to the start of the office building. Additive alternates include the construction of a 2,176 square foot helibase station in addition to roadway, lighting and fencing improvements. It requires further design development and preparation of a complete set of construction drawings and specifications based upon design considerations and performance specifications included within the contract, and the subsequent construction of this design to result in a complete and finished product suitable for the intended use. This project is located at 34580 Lockwood Valley Road, Frazier Park, CA  93225. The Government intends to award a firm-fixed price Design-Build contract based on the approved design documents for the new District Ranger's Office. The Government will issue two (2) Solicitations in sequence: (1) Phase I and (2) Phase II. The Phase I procedure (which is analogous to a Request for Proposal (RFP) is designed to select a "short list" of the most highly qualified offerors who will be requested to submit Phase II proposals (the short list will be published on FedBizOpps). All responsible sources may submit a Phase I proposal. A minimum of two (2) and a maximum of four (4) firms will be short-listed. The short-listed offerors will be selected to participate in Phase II (analogous to RFP). In Phase II, the Government will issue the RFP to the most highly qualified offerors from Phase I and request that they submit Phase II proposals. Phase II of the solicitation will be prepared in accordance with FAR Part 15 and include Phase II evaluation factors, developed in accordance with FAR 15.304. Phase II of the solicitation shall require submission of technical and price proposals, which shall be evaluated separately in accordance with FAR Part 15. The Government will reserve the right to make an award upon the basis of the initial Phase II offers without discussions. A best value concept will be applied for evaluation of Phase II offers and selection of the successful offeror for this procurement. The best value approach provides the opportunity to select an offeror who is not necessarily the lowest-priced or the highest technically-ranked. The Forest Service will select the proposal that represents the best value based on the evaluation of technical factors and price, with technical factors being weighed more heavily than price. Therefore, the offeror's proposal should contain the offeror's best terms.

2010 Mexican Spotted Owl Territory Monitoring
Magdalena Ranger District
Cibola National Forest

SECTION CDESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATIONS/STATEMENT OF WORK

C.1 OBJECTIVE OF MONITORING CONTRACT

The contractor shall furnish all labor, supervision, supplies, transportation, equipment and materials (except for Government furnished property) needed to conduct formal monitoring of  sixteen known Mexican spotted owl (MSO) Protected Activity Centers (PACs) in the San Mateo and Magdalena Mountains of central New Mexico. All monitoring will be done according to established protocol to determine presence/absence and reproductive success.  

The contractor shall submit completed forms, maps, digital images and a final report of all findings. 


General  

A four-wheel drive vehicle is recommended, but not necessary. Conditions of track roads can be poor when wet.  Some of the access roads can be rough.   

The 2010 weather is forecast for warm temperatures and continued dry conditions. The entire Cibola National Forest was under Fire Restrictions in 2006.  Campfires, charcoal grills and stove fires were prohibited on national forest lands except in developed camp and picnic grounds where grills were provided.  Smoking was allowed within an enclosed vehicle or building; a developed recreation site; or while stopped in an area at least three feet in diameter and free of all flammable material.  If dry conditions continue, the District may be under a total closure again during the 2010 MSO monitoring season.  In that case, the contractor may be given specific written permission to continue survey work during the closure.  

Mexican spotted owl  Monitoring

MSO monitoring may be performed beginning as soon as April 16, 2010 and will be completed by August 31, 2010.  Upon completion of the field survey, the Contractor shall have 21 calendar days to deliver the Final Report to the COR. 

Informal monitoring and/or pre-calling daytime visits may be done to known nest sites within MSO PACs during dates established in the MSO protocol included in this package (Pre-calling Daytime Visits).  If MSO are located during informal and/or pre-calling visits, only reproductive success visits would need to be done thereafter.

If MSO are not located during daytime visits, formal MSO monitoring shall be performed according to the MSO protocol attached to this contract package.  Only the actual PAC areas need formal monitoring.

Any location marking method, such as flagging or Brite Eyes, may be used to mark calling routes or routes to nest/roost locations.  All markers placed during this contract must be removed at the conclusion of the contract.  GPS locations will be taken for each route and placed on the standard topographic maps described above. 

If a MSO flies or appears to be located on private land, no attempts will be made to cross ownership boundaries.  Contractor will show direction of flight on a map included in the final report, or estimate the location of the area a MSO appears to be located in.

It is the contractors responsibility to assure all persons conducting the monitoring work meet training and certification requirements.  Proof of training and required Region 3 certification shall be provided to the Contracting Officer prior to award, for crew leaders and preferably all crewmembers.  (Crewmembers certified after award of contract must show certification prior to initiation of fieldwork).

Monitoring information shall be documented on the MSO monitoring forms (attached).

It is the responsibility of the Contractor to determine local conditions affecting road access to each site.  Notify the COR within 2 working days if weather caused road inaccessibility (on an open road) is delaying work.

C.4 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

All required forms (inventory, daytime follow-up, etc) shall be completed in accordance with the protocol/guideline requirements and shall be submitted in accordance with the specifications in C and as part of the Deliverables, as specified in C.

Any spotted owl nest or roost trees located shall be photo-documented in daytime on digital format and labeled with Ranger District, UTM, content of photo (i.e. nest site, roost site, MSO chick, MSO female, etc) and date.  Original digital image shall become property of the Government.  At least one nest tree photo will be from enough distance to show the entire tree.

Locations of active MSO nest sites other than those previously active shall be plotted on the topographic map and shall be cross-referenced in the report.  Use UTMs to describe the nest site on the topographic map.  GPS coordinates shall be provided by the contractor.   

Active spotted owl PACs shall be reported to the COR within 2 working days.  These shall be reported by PAC name, unless a new territory is discovered at which time a PAC name will be determined by the agency biologist.

Regular field monitoring work can begin as soon as April 16, 2010 and will be completed by August 31, 2010.  Upon completion of the field survey, the Contractor shall have 21 calendar days to deliver the Final Report to the COR. 

Informal monitoring and/or pre-calling daytime visits may be done to known nest sites within MSO PACs during dates established in the MSO protocol included in this package (Pre-calling Daytime Visits).  If MSO are located during informal and/or pre-calling visits, only reproductive success visits would need to be done thereafter.

If  MSO are not located during daytime visits, formal MSO monitoring shall be performed according to the MSO protocol attached to this contract package.  Only the actual PAC areas need formal monitoring.

Any location marking method, such as flagging or Brite Eyes, may be used to mark calling routes or routes to nest/roost locations.  All markers placed during this contract will remain at the conclusion of the contract. GPS locations will be taken for each route and placed on the standard topographic maps described above. 

If a MSO flies or appears to be located on private land, no attempts will be made to cross ownership boundaries.  Contractor will show direction of flight on a map included in the final report, or estimate the location of the area a MSO appears to be located in.

It is the contractors responsibility to assure all persons conducting the monitoring work meet training and certification requirements.  Proof of training and required Region 3 certification shall be provided to the Contracting Officer prior to award, for crew leaders and preferably all crewmembers.  (Crewmembers certified after award of contract must show certification prior to initiation of fieldwork).

Monitoring information shall be documented on the MSO monitoring forms (attached).

It is the responsibility of the Contractor to determine local conditions affecting road access to each site.  Notify the COR within 2 working days if weather caused road inaccessibility (on an open road) is delaying work.


Northern Goshawk-Mt. Taylor Ranger District

Monitoring field work may be performed beginning as soon as April, 20.  Daytime goshawk monitoring can be done while the Contractor is in the general area for MSO monitoring.  The main objective of this work is to confirm absence/presence and determine reproductive success rather than follow protocol.  The Contractor may simply walk to known nests to determine presence to begin with.  If goshawks are not located, the Contractor will revert to the Kennedy-type protocol.  

A minimum of 4 and a maximum of 6 complete monitoring visits will be made to each goshawk nest site.  The minimum will be made if a nest is found active early in the monitoring.  Subsequent visits will be made to confirm reproduction and survival of nestlings.  If nesting activity is confirmed in May, visits for reproduction success and survival should be spread through May/June and possibly July.

The maximum number of visits will be made if an active nest is not located.  These visits will be evenly spaced from late May through mid-July.  A complete visit is having called the last known active nest site, and each alternate and reserve nest sites until absence or presence is confirmed.

Follow a goshawk outside of the post-fledging family area (PFA) boundary if necessary to a nest, but not onto private land.  Concentrate all subsequent visits in this area to a maximum of 6.

If a goshawk is responsive to calling or is sighted, but the Contractor in unable to locate the nest tree, map the response and return to the area as soon as possible.  There is no need to maintain a break in calling when active follow-up visits are being conducted.

Any motorized vehicles used to perform survey or monitoring work must remain on established, open roads.  Bicycles or horses may be taken anywhere.

Any temporary markers, such as flagging, used to locate travel routes or nest trees must be removed during the last monitoring visit to an area.

The contractor will provide in the final report a written estimate of time required to monitor each MSO and goshawk territory including 1) average driving time in minutes from Grants, New Mexico to the start of monitoring route, 2) average hiking time in minutes to beginning of monitoring route, 3) average time spent calling each territory for a complete survey. 

C.4 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

All required forms (inventory, daytime follow-up, etc) shall be completed in accordance with the protocol/guideline requirements and shall be submitted in accordance with the specifications in C and as part of the Deliverables, as specified in C.

Any spotted owl nest or roost trees located shall be photo-documented in daytime on digital format and labeled with Ranger District, UTM, content of photo (i.e. nest site, roost site, MSO chick, MSO female, etc) and date.  Original digital image shall become property of the Government.  At least one nest tree photo will be from enough distance to show the entire tree.

Locations of active MSO nest sites other than those previously active shall be plotted on the topographic map and shall be cross-referenced in the report.  Use UTMs to describe the nest site on the topographic map.  GPS coordinates shall be provided by the contractor.

<p>By adding better and new capabilities to the existing system, the variety of applications and the quality of the work possible will significantly increase beyond the capabilities of the current system. Carl Zeiss SMT, Inc. will install these proprietary additions. These components are fully integrated with the base instrumentation, which provides reliability and data integrity that in general, in many cases cannot be achieved with other third party solutions.</p>
<p>These much needed upgrades of the Orion He Ion Microscope, can only be obtained from Carl Zeiss SMT, Inc. because they are manufactured and sold by Carl Zeiss SMT, Inc and there are no other distributors.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, however, responses received by April 23, 2010 will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government whether to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

The Visualyse software package is a radio communications modeling tool sold as a commercial product without source and design rights. The Visualyse software package is used for simulating both satellite and terrestrial networks and the interactions between them. The NWS Spectrum Manager uses the Visualyse software package to conduct interference analyzes and protect National Weather Service equipment frequencies. The most recent and ongoing Visualyse software package is used to assess the International Mobile Telecommunication industry sharing requests from interfering with NEXRAD WSR-88D weather radar performance. The Visualyse software package is accepted and used by regional and international radio frequency regulators, following International Telecommunication Union (ITU) recommendations, and has been used in many frequency recommendation papers presented at ITU Working Groups, Plenipotentiary Conference, and the World Radiocommunication Conference. The Visualyse software package has been accepted by the ITU as being able to carry out the analysis required to determine the need for coordination between satellite and ground based systems in accordance with ITU-Radiocommunication (ITU-R) Handbook and Publications. ITU-R Handbook and Publications are text which provides a statement of the current knowledge, the present position of studies, or of good operating or technical practice, in certain aspects of radiocommunications, which should be addressed to a radio engineer, system planner or operating official who plans, designs or uses radio services or systems, paying particular attention to the requirements of developing countries. The Visualyse software package meets the recommendations of the ITU-R Handbook and ITU-R Publications; 1) Radiowave propagation - SG03, 2) Fixed-satellite service - SG04, 3) Broadcasting services - SG06, 4) Science Services - SG07, 5) Mobile Radiodetermination, Amateur and Related Satellite Services - SG08, and 6) Fixed Service - SG09. The ITU-R Handbook and ITU-R Publications may be obtained from the ITU at http://www.itu.int/publications/publications.aspx?lang=en&amp;parent=R-HDB&amp;selection=7&amp;sector=1 <br />Vendors who believe they can satisfy the Government's requirements are invited to submit an affirmative response. To be considered an affirmative response, vendors must submit written data and documentation that reflect meeting the aforementioned requirements for ITU compliance. All responsible sources must submit a written narrative statement of capability including detailed technical information and other technical literature sufficient to permit agency analysis in order to determine a bona fide capability to meet the requirements. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement for competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within its discretion. Affirmative responses must be received within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. <br />Period of Performance: One year from date of the award<br />Place of Contract Performance:<br />DOC/NOAA/NWS<br />Engineering and Acquisition Branch, W/OPS11<br />1325 East-West Hwy., SSMC2, Room 3116<br />Silver Spring, MD 20910<br />Attn: Joe Friedel@(301)-713-1795x106)<br />Grace.E.Carter-Tyer@noaa.gov

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIRSYSCOM) intends to award a Firm-Fixed Price/Cost-type, sole-source Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to deliver Aircraft Capability Integration, Systems/Software Testing, and Training Systems products in support of PMA209, Air Combat Electronics Program Office. The effort includes requirement specification, engineering design and development of software and hardware integration solutions, implementation/fabrication and maintenance of avionics laboratory test benches, Independent Validation and Verification (IV&amp;V) testing of project/program-related hardware/software, and development of training systems for PMA209's Core Capabilities. The Contractor shall incorporate platform-specific capability requirements, develop and maintain all required documentation, provide technical oversight, modify/correct test software/hardware, and maintain Quality Assurance and Configuration Management. Aircraft Capability Integration, Systems/Software Testing, and Training Systems will include, but not be limited to: engineering investigations, integration, and maintenance of test equipment and software. NAVAIR intends to award this effort on a sole source basis to DCS Corporation, 46641 Corporate Drive, Lexington Park, MD 20653. This acquisition is being pursued on a sole source basis under the authority found in 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Companies may contact Nancy Hayden (240-237-4905) at DCS for possible subcontracting opportunites. DCS Corporation has been providing uninterrupted support to PMA209 programs since 1984 and has assembled a cadre of Subject Matter Experts in a variety of PMA209 Communication, Navigation and Surveillance Capabilities. DCS has continued to provide quality support while continuously improving the breadth of products and services offered to the program office based upon leveraging from expertise developed from each preceding Task Order. DCS Corporation has provided product related service in past years that includes design, development, test, system level test and evaluation and trainers/training for PMA209 product lines. This includes MIL-STD-1553B CDNU-800 Control Software for a variety of systems including ARC-210, Embedded Global Positioning System / Inertial Navigation System (EGI), Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS), Carrier Aircraft Inertial Navigation System (CAINS) II, and applicable Computer Based Trainers for similar systems. Applicable Hardware/Software development benches were designed and implemented to accommodate the developmental activities.
<p>The Common Systems Integration Lab (CSIL) was designed and assembled by DCS Corporation on behalf of the PMA209 Communication Navigation Surveillance / Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) IPT. Currently, there are four benches that were built by DCS Corporation for four platforms - E-2C, C-2A, CH-53E and P-3C. Level III engineering drawings were not procured and, as such, no other source can modify the benches effectively without incurring unacceptable schedule impacts, increased resources, and substanial risk. Third party equipment and solutions that could be introduced as substitutes would promote risk and impact the behavior and validity of the systems level testing that is currently being accomplished. The configuration management for functionality resident within each platform's systems test bench within the CSIL must be maintained to permit proper Independent Validation &amp; Verification. The benches were designed to accommodate many common parts and the interchangeability is part of what makes the approach to this functionality affordable from the Navy's perspective. In addition to the hardware, there are considerable software test scripts and interface programs that DCS Corporation has developed and implemented in support of the CSIL's progress and philosophy. In accordance with schedule and funding constraints, this software has not been documented nor placed in configuration management (CM) to permit other contractors with source documentation to perpetuate the design, assembly and staffing of current upgrades and new platforms.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that the FSC code will be 6605 (Navigational Instruments). The estimated period of performance is five years. The estimated award date for this contract is 22 September 2010. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. This synopsis is for informational purposes only. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. Interested parties may contact Vikki Thompson by e-mail at victoria.thompson@navy.mil or may fax information to (301) 995-0357, Attn: Vikki Thompson, Code AIR-2.5.1.8.16. Please respond via email or fax; no phone calls will be accepted. Note: Contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database to be eligible for contract award or payment from any DoD activity. A determination not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government is not committed nor obligated to pay for the information provided and no basis for claims against the Government shall arise as a result of this synopsis. Note 22 applies.</p>

<DESC>NAICS Code: 511120   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Air and Radiation (OAR), Office of Atmospheric Programs (OAP), Climate Protection Partnerships Division (CPPD), ENERGY STAR Residential Branch (ESRB) intends to award a sole source fixed-price purchase order underthe authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures to Home Energy Magazine, in Berkeley, CA. The purpose of this acquisition is to produce a series of home performance and retrofit articles in the bi-monthly issues of Home Energy Magazine, plus annual compilation of these and other articles reprinted in the form of an Home Performance Contractor's Guide. 
Since 1984, Home Energy Magazine has been the premiere source for practical advice on energy efficiency building technologies, appliances, health and safety issues, business strategies for home performance contractors, green building news and water conservation.  Home Energy Magazine delivers authoritative articles on every aspect of residential energy and water efficiency.  It is the leading magazine to thoroughly cover residential energy and utility issues to those practitioners in the field. Their readership covers the target audience for this initiative.  The Department of Energy (DOE) and EPA have collaborated on other special editions of Home Energy Magazine in the past, featuring stories of successful contractors who provided business guidance and support.  These special editions were widely distributed and continue to be a resource for contractors and energy efficiency program implementers.  Home Energy Magazine is the leading publication covering minimizing the environmental impact of homes from the whole house perspective.  The DOE & EPA's collaborative effort on these articles and Guide will help increase demand for Home Performance with ENERGY STAR by growing a competent contracting base that can deliver whole house services with business best practices that ensure longevity. Ultimately, this guide will help increase the potential for a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions via more energy efficient existing homes. This in turn promotes the Climate Protection Partnership Division's goal of reducing U.S. domestic emissions of greenhouse gases.
NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE (RFQ) IS AVAILABLE. Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting EPA's requirement as stated herein may submit a capability statement, which if received within ten (10) calendar days of the date of this announcement will be considered. Responses to this posting must be in writing and provide clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government. A determination not to compete the proposed purchase order based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. All questions should be directed to Sharron K. Doherty via the e-mail link below.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<p>Description<br />Capable sources are sought to deliver an integrated software solution that improves product capabilities of the current Order of Battle (OB) functionality for the Defense Intelligence Modernized Integrated Data Base (MIDB) Enterprise (DIME) including all elements of OB data production and dissemination in support of the warfighter operations and national production.</p>
<p>The successful software approach will: (1) advance the current software functionality towards full automation of all needed OB capabilities, including support to the following ten components of the system: MIDB Data Access Layer (MDAL), General Military Intelligence Database (GMIDB), Morpheus user interface, MIDB XML Data Exchange (MXDE), Person of Interest (POINT) Database, Point Data Access Layer (PDAL), Association (ASSOC) Database, ASSOC Data Access Layer, Replication, and Cross-version Bridge (CVB); (2) improve software performance; and (3) incorporate new versions of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) and newly developed (i.e. Government-Off-The-Shelf (GOTS)) software, as required.</p>
<p>The effort also requires the successful offeror to: (1) participate in integration and or testing with various operating environments for the Department of Defense Intelligence Information System (DoDIIS), to include Global Command and Control System (GCCS)- Integrated Intelligence and Imagery (GCCS-I3), GCCS-Joint (GCCS-J), GCCS-Joint Digital Intelligence Support System (GCCS-JDISS), GCCS-Maritime (GCCS-M), GCCS-Air Force (GCCS-AF), etc.; and (2) respond quickly to user mission needs concerning the training, operations, and management of the delivered software capabilities. While meeting the needs of the Intelligence community-at-large, customer-specific capabilities must be provided and maintained for interoperability with legacy and evolving systems, managed databases, and architecture changes.</p>
<p>The Modernized Integrated Database (MIDB) is the worldwide General Military Intelligence [GMI] database for the Shared Production Program (SPP) to provide GMI data to the warfighter. MIDB is available in both JWICS and SIPRNet domains. To be considered capable, interested parties must demonstrate a knowledge of the following: (1) Describe any relative experience with JWICS and SIPRNet domains; (2) Describe an approach for maintaining an operational baseline while developing and delivering new releases of the system; (3) Describe an approach to build functionally cohesive but loosely coupled databases; (4) Describe a capability to replicate large volumes of data; (5) Describe an ability to work with text, images and mapping data; (6) Describe a method/approach to perform queries against disparate databases which form a comprehensive review for use by a MIDB analyst(s) on a single desktop environment; and (7) Describe an approach for managing a common database architecture between large organizations such as the Defense Intelligence Agency and DoD service components.</p>
<p>Anticipated deliverables include computer software and technical documentation. An Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (ID/IQ) -Supply contract is contemplated with an ordering period of forty-eight (48) months. The acquiring agency anticipates that approximately $49.9 million will be sufficient to cover orders for the duration of the ordering period. Contract type is TBD.</p>

<DESC>Description of Desired Capabilities<br />The Department of the Air Force, Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) Developmental Planning Directorate (XR) intends to issue a sole source contract to MDA Information Systems, Inc. based on an unsolicited proposal. This contract will be for concept maturation and risk reduction of a proprietary technology that is applicable to a future wireless SAR system. The estimated value of this study is $200,000.00.
<p>The following capabilities shall be provided in support of SMC/XRD's risk reduction and concept maturation for a wireless SAR system that entails a lower development, integration and test architecture that is applicable to a future space-based SAR system. The effort should meet the following activities:</p>
<p>1. An Electronically Steerable Array (ESA) SAR antenna architecture that dramatically reduces spacecraft bus power supply requirements (deployable solar array power generation, centralized battery power storage) through a distributed payload power generation and storage architecture.<br />2. Self-powered, independent transmit/receive modules configured in a two-dimensional active phased array antenna with wireless connections to the bus-mounted radar receiver/exciter electronics, thus eliminating complex, heavy power and RF cable networks in the antenna.<br />3. Light weight active phased array antenna structure utilizing high TRL solar array structures, hinges, launch locks and deployment mechanism\s.<br />4. Demonstrate the ability to actively measure antenna position and shape and implement the required real-time phase compensation for light weight, non-rigid antenna architectures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />To accomplish program objectives and meet near-term program milestones, Offerors must be intimately familiar with space based Electronically Steerable Array (ESA) SAR systems and have in place the ability to implement the above capabilities upon award.</p>
<p>Statement of Capabilities<br />Any interested Offeror who is capable of meeting the Government's requirements detailed in this notice must submit a Statement of Capabilities and Qualifications Statement to the technical and contracting POCs listed below by 1700 PST on 23 April 2010. Responses are limited to seven (7) pages.</p>
<p>The capability and qualifications statement will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining the offeror's ability to meet the Government's needs described above and schedule. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. Responses from small business and small, disadvantaged business firms are welcome. Firms responding should indicate if they are a small business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, 8(a) firms, historically black colleges or universities, and minority institutions. A determination not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

The Government is interested in viewing presentations and receiving any additional information regarding an IFBG.  The Government has included as attachments, safety, physical, functional, and environmental requirements that an IFBG should meet, a vendor questionnaire, and a specification. 
The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) is seeking sources capable of providing an Improved Flash Bang Grenade (IFBG).  Current conventional pyrotechnic flashbang grenades are diversionary devices that provide a tactical advantage by temporarily creating psychological and physiological conditions designed to incapacitate personnel while minimizing fatalities, permanent injury to personnel, and undesired damage to property and the environment. These devices may generate an instantaneous combination of sound, light, and/or pressure that distracts or diverts the subject by temporarily causing confusion or disorientation. 
The Government will be hosting an Industry Day on 25 and 26 May 2010 in Bloomington, Indiana at the Courtyard Marriott Hotel.  Firms are invited to present their proposed ideas and solutions to the requirements.  Contractors will be allowed a 30 minute presentation slot, after which a 15 minute Q&A session will occur.  Firms wishing to present are asked to contact Mr. Wade Roark telephone:  812-854-5422, email:  wade.roark@navy.mil , NSWC Crane Division, by COB 13 May 2010 to reserve a presentation slot.  Due to proprietary concerns of the presenting firms, briefers will be asked to wait until their time to present to arrive, and leave immediately following their presentation.
Contractors must be properly registered in the Government's Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and in the Joint Certification Program (JCP) in order to receive the three attachments.  Offerors may obtain information on CCR registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the internet at www.ccr.gov.  Information about the JCP is located at http://www.dlis.dla.mil.  
The attachments will be posted to FedBizOpps at the same time the synopsis is posted.  FedBizOpps may be accessed at http://www.fbo.gov.  Interested contractors must be registered in the Government's Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and in the Joint Certification Program (JCP) in order to receive the attachments.
This sources sought synopsis does not constitute an Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for Quote (RFQ), or a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it should not be construed as a commitment of any kind by the Government to issue a formal solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  The U.S. Government is in no way liable to pay for or reimburse any companies or entities that respond to this announcement.  Any costs incurred by interested companies in response to this announcement or incurred for participation in Bloomington, IN will NOT be reimbursed.
All information marked as proprietary information will be safeguarded to prevent disclosures to non-government personnel and entities.  Your interest in this response is appreciated.  All interested sources are required to submit the vendor questionnaire to Mr. Matt Burkett, Contract Specialist by close of business 13 May 2010.  Questions regarding this announcement may be directed to Mr. Burkett, at telephone (812) 854-8745, or email matt.burkett@navy.mil.

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to award a Sole-Source contract to General Atomics Electronic Systems, Inc. (GA-ESI), 4949 Greencraig Lane, San Diego, CA 92123,  for sixteen items for the repair of RadNet Fixed Monitors.  The associated North Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 334519 and the business size standard is 100 employees.  The required items are spare parts and hardware components of a highly specialized analytical system that includes proprietary software.
The current analytical system, was acquired in 2008, and added components were acquired with full and open competition.  These systems are  under a one year warranty by GA-ESI .  EPA requires spare parts for repair of RadNet  monitors that have exceeded their one year warranty.  The specified spare parts to be acquired are produced by GA-ESI specifically for use in the RadNet Fixed Monitor Systems.  Neither these nor equivalent components are available from other sources.  The EPA believes GA-ESI is the only vendor capable of satisfying the Agency's requirements. The circumstances permitting Other than Full and Open Competition Justification is FAR 6.302, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy Agency requirements."  
The intent of this synopsis is to determine if any source(s) exists and, therefore, no Request for Proposal (RFP) is available.  Consequently, any response(s) failing to provide a capability statement but instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFP will not be honored.  All interested parties must respond within 15 days (April 23, 2010) of the date of this announcement to William A. Newby, at 109 T.W. Alexander Drive, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711 (Mail Code: E105).  Interested vendors shall:  1) include information on the proposed services which clearly supports the requirements outlined above; 2) fully explain your capabilities and qualifications and; 3) provide itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible.  Response to this synopsis must be made in writing.  No telephonic or faxed request will be honored.

Utilizing the Stevens Recorder provided by CDWR, the monthly record of flow through the Parshall Flume is submitted on a monthly basis.
The data collected is analyzed and the results forwarded within five working days after the end of the month in which the work is performed.
A water year record, both calendar & fiscal (October 1 through September 30), of the flows at the 12-foot Parshall Flume will be submitted to the United States Geological Survey (USGS) for review on or before February 15 of each year.  Upon USGS approval, the report is presented / submitted to the Rio Grande Compact Commission the end of February.
The original data will be filed for the period of time required by the Rio Grande Compact for hydrologic data.  These records will be available to Reclamation, the Compact Commission, and other agencies for publication or other related work.

That record along with many others from throughout the basin are presented in final form to the Rio Grande Compact Commission for final approval.
Twenty years of data prepared by the Colorado Division of Water Resources provides not only baseline data from the first year of operation of the project, but consistency / reliability, in reporting water deliveries to the Rio Grande.  This hydrological data is of utmost importance in reporting and documentation in case of legal action against the Project on a state or national level.

Firms stated they do "real time" measurements and don't have the equipment to record or store information.  Their services are to check the accuracy of installed flow meters on a periodic basis.
8- Determination of fair and reasonable costExplain how we know or will be able to determine reasonableness of costs.

The Colorado Division of Water Resources has been collecting hydrologic data from the waterways, pumping plants, and measuring structures within the Closed Basin Division Project area for the last twenty years with only a 3% (approximate) increase in price each year.  
9- Other facts supporting use of other than full and open competitionAddress applicable items such as why specifications, statement of work, etc., are not or cannot be available timely; harm, financial or otherwise, to the Gov't if not procured as proposed, etc.
Three years ago, ground water rules were established by the Division Engineers' Office implementing the requirement that every well have a meter which is accumulative recording of gallons of water pumped.  Closed Basin wells are metered, but the only site accumulatively metered is at the Parshall Flume.  All water pumped by the salvage wells goes through and is accumulatively measured at this site by the CDWR utilizing their own equipment.  If a third party were to perform this service for AFD, and the CDWR, who take measurements anyway, were to find a discrepancy in the readings provided by this third party, then all data could be in question and AFD could lose the variance granted by the State of Colorado.  If this variance is lost, the cost to meter 170 wells will cost $850,000.  AFD must be compliant and satisfy the State of Colorado in these reporting requirements; the reports generated by CDWR on Closed Basin well's water production meet these needs and are a vital part of reporting to the Rio Grande Compact Commission.   
The CDWR is an active participant in the complexity of meeting Rio Grande Compact requirements among the following:  The states of Colorado, New Mexico and Texas, and the Nation of Mexico. Their longstanding and continued involvement in the Hydrologic data collection is integral in administering and assuring the success of the multi-state and nations involved in the Rio Grande Compact.   
10- List any sources that have expressed interest in this proposed acquisitionN/A

11- Effort to overcome barriers to competition for future acquisitionExplain what can and will be done to improve our ability to obtain competition for these services or supplies when next required.
Under the current market conditions and due to CDWR's role in management of water for the State of Colorado, it is difficult to get adequate third party accountability monitoring on the wells to meet State requirements.  AFD will continue to consider circumstances in the future and will make adjustments as necessary.

<p>Contracting Office Address: Food and Drug Administration <br />5630 Fisher Lane <br />Rockville, Maryland 20857</p>
<p>Description: Sterile Prepared Bacteriological Media</p>
<p>This is a Sources Sought to determine the availability and capability of small business (including certified 8(a), Small Disadvantage businesses, HUB Zone businesses; veteran-owned small businesses, and women-owned small businesses. This notice is being posted for fact finding and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as an Invitation for Bid, a Request for Proposal, Solicitation, Request for Quotes, or an indication the Government will contract for the items or services herein. This notice is not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted as a result of this notice. The Government does not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred to interested parties for responses to this source sought. Any response received will not be used as a proposal. The FDA anticipates using a Firm Fixed Price Purchase Order. The NAICS code is 325413.</p>
<p><br />The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Office of Acquisitions and Grants Services (OAGS), Division of Acquisition Operations (DAO) is seeking to identify sources with capabilities and prior experience to provide a one month supply of Bacteriological Media:</p>
<p>Brand Name or Equal (Biomerieux, Inc.)</p>
<p>001: B8460, Lactose Broth in 500 ml Boston Round Bottles (101 mm x 225 mm glass); 12 Bottles per box, (120) EA.</p>
<p>002: 303050, Tetrathionate Broth with Brilliant Green, 10 ml Tubes (16 mm x 125 mm glass); 100 Tubes per box, (32) EA.</p>
<p>003: 42073, Rappaport Vassiliadis (RV) Medium, 10 ml Tubes (16 mm x 125 mm glass); 20 Tubes per box, (160) EA.<br />004: T8080, M Broth, 10 ml Tubes (16mm x 125 mm glass); 20 Tubes per box, (320) EA.</p>
<p>The Detroit District High Throughput Microbiology Laboratory (HTML), Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA), U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires 720 liters of Lactose Broth, 32 liters of Rappaport Vassiliadis Medium, 32 liters of Tetrathionate Broth and 64 liters of M broth as an approximate one month supply of bacteriological media for the processing of environmental microbiological samples received from FDA field investigations. The majority of these investigations will determine the presence of and the potential for Salmonella adulteration of the U.S. food supply. The Detroit HTML will be receiving up to 600 environmental samples per day, four days per week, through 2010 as part of its defined work plan. These investigative samples will be collected chiefly from food processing firms, and Detroit HTML will receive and process samples from FDA ORA District Offices across the nation. The environmental samples will be analyzed for Salmonella, and regulatory actions could result, based on Detroit HTML analysis. All environmental samples received from field investigations will require enrichment (18 - 24 h), selective enrichment (18 - 24 h), and post-enrichment incubations (6 - 8 h) using the bacteriological media described above and as defined by official AOAC and FDA Bacteriological Analytical Manual methods. Under normal operating conditions, sample initiation will occur four days per week (Tuesday through Friday) with the Detroit HTML processing a maximum of 1,800 environmental samples during a 24 hour period. During emergency operations, the processing of environmental samples will occur seven days per week with media requirements also being increased. A dependable supplier/vendor with the ability to provide the required custom volumes of bacteriological media to the Detroit HTML under these emergency operations is necessary. The consistent supply of sterile bacteriological media in a timely fashion is essential to the Detroit HTML efforts to protect the U.S. food supply from Salmonella adulteration and thereby the American consumer from the threat of Salmonella poisoning. The on-time delivery of the above described microbiological media will allow the Detroit HTML to respond to emergencies in a timely, efficient and safe manner.</p>
<p>The sterile, prepared media for Salmonella analyses of FDA investigative samples, must include Lactose Broth, Rappaport Vassiliadis Medium, Tetrathionate Broth with Brilliant Green and M Broth. The media must be validated and quality controlled to perform optimally in Biomerieux's VIDAS Salmonella detection system. The media must be provided sterile with a certificate of sterility, and in glass vessels of 500 ml for Lactose Broth, and 10 ml for RV, Tetrathionate and M Broths. These media will be essential for the proper analysis of environmental microbiological samples received from FDA field investigations. Once received, these official investigative FDA samples will be subject to AOAC approved methods of analysis that are further defined by the FDA's Bacteriological Analytical Manual. Under normal operating conditions, sample initiation will occur four days per week (Tuesday through Friday). Detroit HTML will be processing a maximum of 1,800 environmental sub-samples during a 24 hour period. During emergency operations, the laboratory will be operating 24 hours per day seven days per week. Thus bacteriological media may need to be supplied at a higher rate, than is specified, and the manufacturer/supplier should have the flexibility to increase this supply upon short but reasonable notice.</p>

<DESC>THE 2007 NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRIAL CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS)  CODE APPLICABLE TO THIS PROCUREMENT:   221 UTILITIES
THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  
The Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Mid-Atlantic (NAVFAC-MA) intends to award a sole source contract under the authority of 10 U.S.C  2913 which allows the Navy to enter into agreements with gas or electric utilities to design and implement cost-effective demand and conservation incentive programs (including energy management services, facilities alterations, and the installation and maintenance of energy savings devices and technologies by the utilities) in order to address the  requirements and circumstances of the installation.  This contract is referred to as a Utility Energy Savings Contract (UESC).   For purposes of qualifying under this notice, an entity must meet the definition of a Utility before an agreement can be initiated.    
The proposed procurement is for identification of various Energy Conservation Measures in specified areas via a no-cost preliminary energy audit.  This project provides for energy efficiency upgrades at several buildings at NSA Mechanicsburg, Philadelphia Navy Yard Annex, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  The primary goal of the project is to reduce energy consumption and provide more sustainable building infrastructure at the Philadelphia Navy Yard Annex. These improvements will be accomplished by removing approximately 25 buildings from the existing central steam plant and related steam distribution system, owned by the Philadelphia Authority for Industrial Development (PAID), The preliminary audit will require on-site building investigation and evaluation to determine if any significant energy conservation opportunities exist and whether further detail energy analysis is warranted.   The Government may elect to proceed with further phases under the UESC which include but are not limited to the feasibility study phase; the engineering and design phase; the implementation phase.  The process requires that the responsible Utility must have the ability to provide or obtain financing on terms at least as good as those available to customers in a comparable service class, or with a comparable risk profile.  Therefore, contractor will not receive compensation until completion of the implementation project, and payments will be based on a long-term (15 year) amortization schedule.    
Interested utilities may identify their interest and ability to meet the requirements stated herein and may submit their corporate capabilities for consideration.  The submission must include the NAICS code and Cage Code.    A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.  Responses to this posting must be submitted to Elizabeth.carmack@navy.mil in PDF format no later than April 15, 2010.

<p>Date: April 07, 2010</p>
<p>Action: Announcement of Intent to Acquire Using Other than Full and Open Competition <br /><br />Program Title: TSA Enterprise Logging Management</p>
<p>Solicitation Number: HSTS0310QCIO566</p>
<p>Program Office: TSA Office of Information Technology / IT-Security</p>
<p>PSC Code: D307 - Automated Information Systems Design and Integration</p>
<p>NAICS Code: 541519 - Other Computer Related Services</p>
<p>Contracting Office Address: Department of Homeland Security, Transportation Security Administration, Headquarters TSA, 601 S. 12th Street TSA-25, 10th FL, Arlington, VA 20598-6025</p>
<p>Description: The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) intends to contract using other than full and open competition in providing an Enterprise Log Management system (ELM). The current vendor will supply both 90-day online and 7-year offline data storage for the agency's security audit logs, a requirement uniquely suited for the current TSA Security Operations Center provider. At present, the TSA Security Operations Center (SOC) is the natural aggregation point for all security logs. <br />Assigning the balance of TSA's Enterprise Log Storage to the current TSA SOC Provider constitutes the most efficient and effective use of Government resources, inasmuch as the collection and logging of events is already being accomplished at the SOC on a limited basis. The Period of Performance on this action would run from September 1, 2010, through August 31, 2015. Accordingly, TSA intends to award a contract to:</p>
<p>Systems Research and Applications Corporation [SRA]<br />4300 Fair Lakes Court <br />Fairfax, VA 22033</p>
<p>This contract will address the requirements of the TSA Office of Information Technology / IT-Security Division, specifically with the purpose of providing a full level of Service and Support for Enterprise Log Management at the TSA Security Operations Center [SOC] in Ashburn, VA. Functional requirements for the Enterprise Log Management System solution shall include the professional services required for the installation and configuration of the solution, and the need for ongoing vendor-supplied maintenance and support.</p>
<p>The Enterprise Log Management (ELM) system will be installed in the Security Operations Center (SOC) network enclave and will collect log data from event sources within the Transportation Security Administration Network (TSANet) General Support System (GSS) and Infrastructure Core Servers (ICS) GSS enclaves. The event sources exist within semi-trusted and trusted zones within the TSANet.</p>
<p>The system must be capable of storing 40 TB of log data in online storage and 1 Petabyte of log data in offline storage. Average incoming data rate across a normal utilization cycle will not exceed 5.5 Mb/s, but peak utilization can be expected to exceed this amount. The system must be capable of retaining security audit logs for a period of 90 days in online storage and 7 years in offline storage.<br />In addition, the ELM system shall have the capability to leverage vendor provided reports, create reports, and easily modify reports for management uses, team uses, and specific end user requirements. <br />The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.</p>
<p>Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This Notice of Intent is not a request for competitive proposals.</p>
<p>However, all responses received thirty days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<a href="mailto:sarah.m.tierney@usace.army.mil">USACE HNC, Huntsville</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Huntsville Engineering and Support Center (CEHNC) intends to award modifications to its Electronic Security Systems (ESS) Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contracts extending each contracts ordering period consistent with the terms identified within this announcement.  The ESS program requirements are currently executed via firm fixed price and/or time and materials task orders which are placed against six (6) ID/IQ contracts in order to provide quick response for ESS procurement/installation services and delivery of security and force protection measures, close circuit television, and maintenance and service on installed equipment/systems at Government installations and facilities.  Services include, but are not limited to development of equipment installation engineering plans; providing hardware and software; system testing and check-out; performing facility modification and work required to support equipment installation; providing security and force protection measures; interfacing with and installing new data transmission equipment; determining compatibility of new equipment with existing systems; preparing system and component documentation; providing operation and maintenance manuals; providing ESS training; warranting systems; maintaining and servicing systems; operating and monitoring systems; preparing after action and other reports; and providing as-built installation drawings.  The scope also includes other electronic control and data acquisition systems services, such as Utility Monitoring and Control Systems (UMCS).  Additionally, the contracts require the handling and generation of classified information.  The services may call for extensive domestic and foreign travel.  All current contract awards were made under full and open competition procedures. The ordering period for these contracts is to expire in November/December 2010.  As a result, CEHNC is developing its acquisition strategy and conducting pre-award functions for the follow-on ESS acquisitions, under NAICS code 561621.  The solicitation(s) for the follow-on acquisitions are slated to be released in May 2010 with the projected awards to be made in Spring 2011.  Due to the lapse in coverage, it is necessary that the current contracts be extended to compensate for the period in which there would have been no contract coverage.  Therefore, it is the Governments intention to modify the current ESS ID/IQ contracts to extend the ordering period by six (6) months and increase contract capacity by $75 million.  Once the follow-on acquisitions are awarded, ordering against the current contracts will cease.<BR><BR>The programmatic capacity for the current contracts is $500 million encompassing a total possible five (5) year ordering period (one (1) base year and four (4) one-year option periods).  This capacity was established based on an analysis of  the type of work required, anticipated workload, effects on competition, the capability of small businesses to compete for the required work, and upon historical ESS contract/program data. Upon award of the follow-on acquisitions, new task orders will not be placed against the current contracts despite any remaining capacity.<BR><BR>The current contracts which the Government intends to modify consistent with the terms identified within this announcement are as follows:  W912DY-05-D-0013 (Williams Electric), W912DY-05-D-0014 (Johnson Controls Bldg Systems), W912DY-05-D-0015 (Siemens Government Services), W912DY-05-D-0027 (Infotec Systems Corporation), W912DY-05-D-0018 (SEI Group, Inc.), and W912DY-05-D-0019 (LVW Electronics).  The original basic contract Scope of Work for each contract award will remain unchanged.  <BR><BR>The Government intends to award the modifications to these contracts consistent with the terms identified within this announcement upon the basis of the authority provided in 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) and implemented by FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy requirement.  Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirements would result given any other action due to current circumstances.  Due to the unique prior experience and involvement of the current contractors and the anticipated recurring need for facility repairs and renovations, the actions proposed within this announcement are justified.  The Government will support the proposed actions by written justifications and obtain appropriate approval prior to proceeding.  The Government will synopsize the contract modifications after award.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all capability statements received within fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  Capability Statements submitted should demonstrate the offerors experience and expertise to provide the services identified above within the time frame required and without substantial duplication of cost to the Government.  The statement shall include pricing information which includes profit rate, overhead rate, G&A rate, project management and support personnel rates; business size; ability to self-perform work; layers of subcontracting and associated mark-ups; and any other information indicating a legitimate ability to meet these specific requirements.  Statements should not exceed 5 pages in length.  Written inquiries may be directed to Ms. Wanda Hampton via email at Wanda.H.Hampton@usace.army.mil or Mr. Adam Sunstrom via email at Adam.R.Sunstrom@usace.army.mil.

<p>52.217-5 Evaluation of Options (Jul 1990)<br />Except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206(b) not to be in the Government's best interests, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>52.217-8 Option to Extend Services (Nov 1999)<br />The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract. These rates may be adjusted only as a result of revisions to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary of Labor. The option provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within 30 days.</p>
<p>52.217-9 Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Mar 2000)<br />(a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within 30 days; provided that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 60 days before the contract expires. The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension. <br />(b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause. <br />(c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed 4months.</p>

<DESC>This is a Combined Synopsis/Solicitation for the Uiltity Privatization of the Water Distribution system at Dobbins Air Reserve Base. This synopsis' pre-solicitation was FA3002-09-R-0025. Dobbins Air Reserve Base in Marietta, Ga., is located 16 miles northwest of Atlanta. Owned by the Air Force Reserve, Dobbins ARB supports more than 10,000 guardsmen and reservists from the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force. It is home to nearly 50 aircraft assigned to different flying units and boasts more than 7,500 take-offs and landings each month. Dobbins ARB is the home for the 94th Airlift Wing (94 AW) and Headquarters 22nd Air Force (22 AF). The Dobbins ARB water distribution system consists of all appurtenances physically connected to the distribution system from the point in which the distribution system enters the Installation and Government ownership currently starts to the point of demarcation, defined by the Right of Access. The system may include, but is not limited to, pipelines, valves, fire hydrants, storage facilities, pump house, control sensors, cathodic protection, exterior backflow devices, pumps, meters, emergency generator, and other ancillary fixed equipment. The actual inventory of items sold will be in the bill of sale at the time the system is transferred. The following description and inventory is included to provide the Contractor with a general understanding of the size and configuration of the distribution system. The Government makes no representation that the inventory is accurate. The Contractor shall base its proposal on site inspections, information in the technical library, other pertinent information, and to a lesser degree the following description and inventory. Specifically excluded from the water distribution system privatization are:<br />&bull; Irrigation systems<br />&bull; Non-potable fire systems<br />&bull; Dobbins ARB is supplied potable drinking water from the Cobb County-Marietta Water Authority, a regional wholesale provider. The drinking water is delivered to customers by the Cobb County Water System, an agency of the Cobb County government. Water flows in an updated steel water main from the water plant onto Dobbins ARB through an 18-inch pressure line and 18-inch control valve. The water main traverses Dobbins ARB and enters the Lockheed Martin leased property. Dobbins ARB and Lockheed Martin maintain an agreement for Lockheed Martin to meter and supply all potable water to the Base. Lockheed Martin bills Dobbins ARB for its monthly water consumption. The south side of Dobbins ARB is supplied potable water directly from the Cobb County Water System. Water flows from the water plant onto Dobbins ARB through a 16-inch pressure line and 16-inch control valve. <br />&bull; The Dobbins ARB water distribution system includes various components located on the exterior of Base facilities. Along with the typical water main pipes, valves, and fire hydrants, other devices such as check valves, backflow preventers and water supply meters are present. The Dobbins ARB water distribution system does not include cathodic protection devices. <br />&bull; The complete water distribution system consists of buried piping ranging in size from 1-inch service lines to the 18-inch water main at an average depth of 6 feet. The water mains and service lines are oversized cast iron (CI), ductile iron (DI), steel and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe installed anytime from the 1940s to 2005. Approximately 5% of the distribution system mains and roughly 10% of lateral lines lie under paved surfaces. All gate valves are contained in valve boxes and are exercised regularly. There are main potable water supply meters owned by the Cobb County Water System and Lockheed Martin. There are eleven (11) secondary meters owned by Dobbins ARB. The system pressure ranges from 110 to 120 pounds per square inch (psi), with pressure spikes as high as 150 psi. The water quality is regulated by the Georgia Environmental Protection Division. <br />Non-potable fire protection systems are not included in the inventory and standard PODs apply. All fire hydrants and fire lines are connected to the potable water distribution system. Many hydrants have been replaced over the years and are exercised regularly. All base irrigation comes from potable water, but is also regulated with backflow prevention (BFP). Water distribution lines were not included from the Naval Air Station or Lockheed Martin grounds. Hanger 5, formerly operated by the Navy, will transition to the US Air Force and was included in the total water distribution inventory.<br />The Base has numerous tenants leasing facilities for their individual operations. The Base Civil Engineering (BCE) personnel meter the tenants water consumption and bill them for their usage.

If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due. <br />(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and- <br />(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or <br />(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or <br />(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received. <br />(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted. <br />(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel. <br />(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume. <br />(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers.

The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received. <br />(h) Multiple awards.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification.

When establishing the BPA, the Government will consider vendors whose pricing, technical capability to meet the requirement, and past performance will be in the best interest of the Government.

GSB-88 Emulsified Sealer/Binder is a chemically engineered asphalt pavement sealer/binder comprised of a cationic emulsion of Gilsonite Ore, and specially selected plasticizers. This chemical colloid stabilized emulsion has been specifically formulated for sealing asphalt parking lots, city streets, county roads, airport taxiways, and airport parking aprons. GSB-88 provides a durable, yet flexible top coat, while special plasticizers and oils penetrate and rejuvenate asphalt pavements. The result is an emulsified sealer/binder that restores vital components to asphalt pavements lost during the aging and oxidation process. The gilsonite seal provides a long wearing anti-oxidative seal for the surface of the asphalt pavement. GSB-88 beautifies asphalt pavements by drying to an absolute black color.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals 
(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; 
(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; 
(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and 
(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. 
(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(ii) Examples. 
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

(2) o Outside the United States. 
(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)

[  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that

(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. 
(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies 
(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and 
(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. 
(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.) 
(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at https://www.fbo.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at https://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet.  NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable. Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command.
This is a combined synopsis and solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Request For Quotation (RFQ) number is N66604-10-Q-2587. Incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-27. NUWC Division Newport intends to issue a  Firm-Fixed Price contract on a Sole Source basis to Dynamic Engineering, Santa Cruz, CA. for the following items: 
CLIN 0001- FSC INDUSTRY PACK P/N IP-OCTAL-SERIAL-FCS w/ 32K                    FIFO's. (QTY. 14)
CLIN 0002 - MGU INDUSTRY PACK P/N IP-BISERIAL HDP-MGU (QTY. 14)

Required delivery must be 16 weeks after award.   Partial shipments and payment will be authorized; however, all units must be delivered within 16 weeks from date of award.  F.O.B. Destination Naval Station Newport; Newport, RI. The basis of this Sole Source is that the Encapsulated Harpoon Command and Launch Subsystem (EHCLS) III is the follow on development of the EHCLS II which was designed and built in 2001-2004.  Components of the Harpoon Data Processor (HDP) which are identical to that used in the EHCLS II HDP will be used for EHCLS III.  These components have already been integrated with system hardware and software and passed both Hardware Qualification Testing and System Final Qualification Testing.  Reusing EHCLS II components in the EHCLS III design reduces risk, capitalizes on previously conducted development and test work, and maintains commonality among all EHCLS products reducing provisioning burden while providing a common set of maintenance and operation procedures. Any other components would require extensive development and test efforts at a substantial cost to the government.   This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors--Commercial Items applies. Evaluation will be in accordance with FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation--Commercial Items. FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions--Commercial Items and 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders--Commercial Items, and DFARS 52.212-7001, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Applicable to Defense Acquisitions of Commercial Items apply. The following addenda or additional terms and conditions apply: none. Offers should include price and delivery terms and the following additional information: none required. Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) rating of DO-C9 applies. Offers must be submitted to Commercial Acquisition, Building 11, Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Newport, Code 1191, Simonpietri Drive, Newport, Rhode Island 02841-1708, faxed to 401-832-4820, submitted via the NECO Website or e-mailed to neil.santos@navy.mil.

<DESC>FAXED OR EMAILED PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED


*****PLEASE NOTE******
THIS CONTRACT REQUIRES (1) 150 cube Truck with Camper Shell. 


Enclosed please find the formal solicitation package you requested. The Postal Service has determined that Highway Contract Route (HCR) transportation services will no longer be advertised to the public as an Invitation to Bid. Accordingly, this solicitation is being offered to the public as a Request for Proposal. There are significant changes in this process. Some of these changes are as follows:

1. As stated under Clause 2.2.8 in the Terms and Conditions, the Postal Service has implemented a program under which postal highway contract route (HCR) suppliers will obtain fuel at certain designated wholesale fuel servicing facilities and retail fuel servicing facilities; all suppliers are required to participate in the Fuel Management Program (see the Fuel Management Program document enclosed dated December 31, 2009). For evaluation purposes, the contract baseline fuel price per gallon will be determined by the Contracting Officer based on the fueling locations provided by the HCR supplier on the enclosed Fuel Purchase Form (HC 131). The contracting officer will use the average quarterly Department of Energy Regional Fuel Index cost per gallon on the solicitation closing date to evaluate proposals (based on the Fuel Purchase Form submitted). For bulk fuel purchases, the quarterly average USPS Bulk Fuel Program Price Per Gallon will be used for proposal evaluation. Therefore, for line 6 (fuel) on Form 7468A, Highway Transportation Contract  Bid or Renewal Worksheet, the supplier should include the number of gallons only; the cost per gallon and total cost should be set to zero ($0.00).

2. All parties submitting a proposal will continue to receive a formal notification of contract award. The notification will identify the successful vendor and price.

3. Under Clause 2.1, as stated in the Terms and Conditions, this is a fixed rate contract for highway transportation service to be provided according to the Statement of work and Specifications indicated in the solicitation, schedule, and special notes. The basis for payment established for this contract is stated in the solicitation. No adjustments will be made in contract price except as provided under other clauses of this contract.

4. The solicitation may require a supplier to submit with their proposal information that was not previously requested in advance of the closing date. The vendor must carefully review Section 3.1.2 of the HCR Terms and Conditions (February 26, 2010) for Information to be provided. 
5. Section 2.3.3a of the terms and conditions, Termination with Notice, is incorporated in this contract; Section
2.3.3b, Termination for the Postal Service's convenience, does not apply.

The Postal Service reserves the right to award this solicited service with or without discussions.


Once the contract has been awarded, adjustments to the bottom line can be made only in accordance with Management Instructions on Economic Adjustments. If you do not understand the adjustment process, contact the office that published the solicitation for an explanation prior to preparing your offer.

<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D.

The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing emergency non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters. OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions. The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance through a grants mechanism to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVOs), the United Nations agencies and to partners to ensure the implementation and delivery of this assistance. This division also oversees OFDA's non-response efforts in disaster risk reduction. DRM also coordinates with other organizations and donors for the provision of relief supplies and assistance. DRM devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations with a focus on disaster risk reduction. It encompasses a group of technical sector specialists who provide expert capability in assessing the quality of disaster response and disaster risk reduction activities. The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning and guidance, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices. The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical and operational support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations. OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), coordinating and supporting Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and the Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs) as needed.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>

This team consists of six regional groups, each covering the following areas: Europe, the Middle East and Central Asia, East Asia and the Pacific, South Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, Southern, Western and Northern Africa, and East and Central Africa. Each regional group is managed by a Regional Coordinator.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC><p>PROPOSAL DUE DATE EXTENDED TO 28 APR 10<br /><br />SOLICITATION RELEASE DATE:&nbsp;4 March 2010. The 55th Contracting Squadron will be conducting the solicitation and award of a cost plus award fee, non-personal services contract under full and open competition for Joint Satellite Communications (SATCOM) Management and Planning System (JSMPS)/Joint Integrated SATCOM Tool (JIST) Support. This is a follow-on contract to FA4600-05-F-0212. Performance will be for a five-year period. This will include a base period and four one-year option periods.</p>
<p>Services required within the scope of this requirement include technical support; hardware and software installation and integration; database and software development; continued development and deployment of existing JSMPS/JIST tools and capabilities; continued updating and employment of key SATCOM management and planning data; data manipulation and presentation; testing, demonstration, and fielding of developed software systems; and requisite hardware and software sustainment and support activities. JSMPS/JIST will be matured into a fully net-centric, web-enabled database and application suite with a hardware, software, and support architecture to meet the needs of DoD SATCOM stakeholders. The resulting tools and capabilities will provide a robust and secure environment for collaborative Electro-magnetic and Radio Frequency Interference (EMI/RFI) detection, tracking, analysis and mitigation. To accomplish this, JSMPS/JIST would expand existing capabilities encompassing assignment and execution data for all remaining DOD SATCOM systems, acquire needed data from existing and programmed SATCOM system management and planning applications and databases, and make this data readily available as an integrated and user-defined operational picture. To support better Intelligence Community (IC) participation in EMI resolution, JSMPS would be deployed on the JWICS network enclave with a cross-domain solution allowing for near-real time data refreshing from the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) JSMPS/JIST. JSMPS will connect to existing databases to provide data and products for Telemetry Tracking &amp; Control (TT&amp;C) data for all space systems to effectively support EMI resolution. Finally, JSMPS/JIST shall be available and sustainable while data is appropriately protected and secure.</p>
<p>On-site work may be performed at either of the following Government installations:</p>
<p>USSTRATCOM<br />Building 500<br />Offutt AFB, NE 68113-6600</p>
<p>AFSPC <br />Buildings 1470 &amp; 1471 <br />Peterson AFB, CO 80914-3050</p>
<p>All contractor personnel working any direct tasking on the project shall hold a minimum current SECRET security clearance (an interim SECRET clearance is acceptable for newly assigned personnel whose final clearance is still being completed). To work on-site within USSTRATCOM/J661 or within the GSSC, contractor personnel shall have a minimum TOP SECRET clearance and be eligible for Special Compartmented Information (SCI) indoctrination.</p>
<p>The RFP and all associated documents, when issued, will be posted on the required government-wide point of entry. No solicitation is available at this time. Offerors are encouraged to subscribe/register for this solicitation number through http://www.fedbizops.gov to ensure they automatically receive all documents associated with the procurement in a timely manner. All associated documents will be released electronically. The NAICS code is 541512. Anticipated award date is Fall 2010.</p>
<p>Address questions via email to the contract specialist or contracting officer only. No discussions will be conducted telephonically.</p>

<DESC>Project Notice
This project will be funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), and will be subject to additional reporting requirements and additional Buy American Act requirements applicable to ARRA funded projects.  
The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (Alliance/NREL) intends to solicit competitive proposals from prequalified sources for a fixed price with award fee design-build subcontract for the design and construction of a multi-level parking structure and security facility, together with related infrastructure improvements, collectively referred to as Ingress and Egress Upgrades.  The proposed work is located at the NREL South Table Mountain (STM) campus in Golden, Colorado.  
The Alliance for Sustainable Energy, LLC (Alliance) has entered into Contract No. DE-AC36-08-GO28308 with the Department of Energy (DOE), an agency of the U.S. Government, for the management and operation of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).  NREL is the only federal laboratory dedicated to the research, development, commercialization and deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies.
It is intended that construction and substantial completion will be no later than December, 2011.  The firm fixed price for the design-build effort will be negotiated prior to subcontract award and is currently estimated to be within a range of $28,000,000 to $31,000,000. (This range does not include Award Fee).

General Description of Work
The South Table Mountain Ingress & Egress Upgrades project is required to provide parking for a minimum of 1,500 vehicles with the potential to provide parking for up to 1,800 vehicles.  Also included in the project is the design and construction of up to 4,000 lineal feet of South Table Mountain campus roadways and the relocation and expansion of the campus utilities (water, natural gas, sewers, electric, telecom/data, etc).  The project will include a security entrance post with systems and hardware for campus access and security.  Consistent with its mission, NREL seeks to deliver projects that lead the industry in terms of sustainability and energy performance.  In support of the Department of Energys goal to demonstrate energy efficient buildings with a lower impact on the environment, NREL has mandated that all new, habitable buildings constructed on the STM campus be designed to merit at a minimum, a LEED Gold rating from the U.S. Green Building Council.  (Note - Since the effort is design-build, it has not yet been determined which of the structures included in the project may be considered to be habitable.)

Acquisition Process
NREL has selected a two-phase performance-based design-build selection process.  The first phase has been identified as the qualification phase.  Interested firms/teams are requested to submit Qualifications Statements.

The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) is requesting information from generator manufacturers to provide a rough overview of magnitude and cost estimates for new stators, including cores and frames, for two horizontal hydro-electric generators in western Colorado.  The generators are located at the Upper and Lower Molina Powerplants, approximately 30 miles east of Grand Junction, Colorado.  The specifics on the Upper Molina Powerplant can be found at
 http://www.usbr.gov/projects/Powerplant.jsp?fac_Name=Upper+Molina+Powerplant
The specifics on the Lower Molina Powerplant can be found at 
http://www.usbr.gov/projects/Powerplant.jsp?fac_Name=Lower+Molina+Powerplant
Reclamation is interested in this market research on cost estimates prior to developing specifications for these rewinds.  For evaluation purposes, these costs should only include manufacturing and delivering the completed stators to the powerplants.  These estimates should include new stators, cores and frames, manufactured using state-of-the-art materials and methods.  No other work should be included in these cost estimates. 
Specific drawings related to the generators are available by email request to wbennett@usbr.gov.

<DESC>Amendment 4 to DARPA-BAA-10-25, Tactical Relay Information Network (TRITON)<br /><br /><br />The purpose of Amendment 4 to DARPA-BAA-10-25, Tactical Relay Information Network (TRITON), is to issue new requirements and make some administrative changes.  This change is due to a change in the fleet exercise/demonstration strategy and due to schedule uncertainty associated with the TEMPALT approval.  The new demonstration strategy changes the location from Hawaii to the Southern California (SOCAL) operating area, significantly reducing the ASW exercise area and changing the environmental conditions (e.g., JERLOV IB to JERLOV II).  The entire BAA has been restated and is attached.  The attached BAA incorporates Amendments 1, 2 and 3 and includes strike throughs for deletions and bold for additions as a result of Amendment 4.<span><br /><br /></span>

<DESC>This is an amendment to a previously synopsized requirement.  This amendment is necessary to remove the requirement for Government Furnished Material, as previously announced in Amendment 1 on 04/06/2010.  The Government will not be responsible for purchasing, supplying, and delivering the paving material.  The contractor will once again be responsible for purchasing, supplying, delivering, and applying the paving material for this project.  The magnitude of construction is reverted back to "$100,000 to $250,000."
RECOVERY - THIS IS A PROJECT UNDER THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT. This project is for a contractor to resurface the Spruce Mill Trail within Fort Vancouver National Historic Site in accordance with the solicitation project specifications.  The contractor will be responsible for the purchase, delivery, and application of a specified brand name product, to create a natural-looking paved pathway (Spruce Mill Trail). The end result will be a new pathway that looks identical to the existing pathways at the Historic Site, both in texture and color, using the same product and application process as was used previously for the purpose of maintaining a cohesive trail system. The Spruce mill trail is approximately 10 feet wide by 2,300 feet long, and includes the following:  minor blading, shaping, leveling, and compaction of existing gravel subgrade; in addition to placing, and compacting construction grade aggregates and paving resin mix surfacing course; and applying a compatible fog seal.  NAICS code is 237310.  The small business size standard is $33,500,000.  The estimated price range for this project is between $100,000 and $250,000. This project is being solicited and awarded in accordance with the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program, Public law 100-656, and is open to both large and small business concerns.  The solicitation with specifications, site photo, and wage rates will be posted to the websites http:///www.fbo.gov and http://ideasec.nbc.gov on or about April 7, 2010 with a response date 30 days thereafter.  A pre-proposal conference/site visit will be held at the time and place specified in the solicitation (Section L).  A negotiated firm-fixed price contract will be awarded requiring submission of both a technical and a price proposal.  The Government will consider an offeror's technical capability in comparison to its price.  To receive the solicitation package, you must download it from http://ideasec.nbc.gov.  No hardcopies will be mailed or faxed.  Any questions must be in writing and emailed to Phaedra_Fuller@NPS.gov or faxed to 360-565-3018.  Interested parties are urged to check for amendments.  The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation.  This Announcement does not constitute the solicitation.

<DESC>The United States Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under lease in Highland Park, Michigan that will be expiring. The Government is seeking to lease approximately 14,145 contiguous rentable square feet of office and related space. The rentable space must yield a minimum of 12,300 contiguous ANSI/BOMA Office area square feet (OASF). The Government requires approximately 100 secured surface parking spaces. The lease term requirement is for five (5) years, three (3) years firm. The space must be available for occupancy by November 1, 2010. The delineated area is city limits of Highland Park, Michigan.
<p><br />Other applicable requirements include:</p>
<p><br />&bull; Sites which are located directly on a highway or six-lane throughfare shall not be considered if the two directions of traffic are separated by a physical barrier or traffic indicator which doe not permit access from either direction within one block or if the access is directly from the proposed office space.<br /><br />&bull; Space offered shall be located within the equivalent of two city blocks from a primary or secondary street serving the office. The route from the primary or secondary street shall be direct. Locations that have obscure, difficult access shall not be considered. If available, public transportation must be within two blocks of the space.<br /><br />&bull; Space requiring ramps inside the office space will not be acceptable.<br /><br />&bull; Street level space is required.<br /><br />&bull; Employee parking shall be at the rear of the building or near a second private employee entrance is required.<br /><br />&bull; Handicap accessible parking is required immediately at the front of the building.<br /><br />&bull; The Government shall have the right to install a satellite dish or antennae on top of the building, a secured courtyard, or other approved area.</p>
<p><br />The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis and to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.</p>
<p>Please send expressions of interest (e-mail preferred) to:</p>

<p>&bull; Energy efficiency and renewable energy features existing within the building.</p>
<p>&bull; List of building services provided.</p>
<p><br />The Government's decision regarding whether to relocate will be based, in part, on information received in response to this advertisement.</p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Delivery Method:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Construction Management as Constructor (CMc) is the most appropriate acquisition approach given the phased performance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This is the preferred delivery method as it promotes team collaboration/integration, innovation, allows participation in the design, early constructability and pricing input and accelerated schedule.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Contract Type:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There is a preference for Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) vs Firm Fixed Price because it is more representative of a collaborative delivery effort and more evenly distributes cost risk.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Shared Contingency:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The majority of the contractors preferred either carrying their own contingency or an owner's contingency.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Contractors indicated that it was more important to provide good customer service with the possibility of repeat business rather than making a huge profit (unfair) profit on any single project.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The contractors indicated that<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>their experience has shown that projects with a shared contingency, tend to ultimately get the very best value for the dollars available.</span></p>

<p>This opportunity was available only to Res-Care, Inc. under contract number DOLJ06QA00001. The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration and Management on behalf of the Office of Job Corps intends to award a modification in the amount of $43,000 ($42,750 to the Arecibo Job Corps Center and $250 to the Ramey Job Corps Center), operated by Res-Care, Inc.&nbsp; The funding is within the not-to-exceed ceiling for Equipment on this contract.</p>
<p>It would have been impracticable to use a fixed price contract to secure services of the kind or quality required for this modification, since the modification was to an existing Cost Plus Incentive Fee contract (Cost Reimbursement Contract).</p>
<p>The funding is intended to procure the following: $42,750 to replace air conditioning units in Buildings14, 21 and 22 with high efficiency units at Arecibo, and provide additional freight of $250 for the TMB 7000, Automatic Cleaning System (Parts Washer) at Ramey. The operator of the Arecibo and Ramey centers will make these funds available through procurement opportunities, following all applicable FAR procurement regulations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Modification has been awarded on April 7, 2010.</p>

<DESC>RECOVERY - - PER FAR 5.7 THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY; THEREFORE FAR 5.203 DOES NOT APPLY. THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR(S) UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER(S): TPL, Inc. under Contract Number N0001409C0454, P00004 for High Power Density Capacitors for High Temperature Navy Applications. The Office of Naval Research has issued a modification using American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) funds to exercise Option II (CLIN 0003) TO CONTRACT N0001409C0454.  This contract is an SBIR Phase II Commercialization Pilot Program (CPP) award under Topic Number N04-125 entitled High Power Density Capacitors for High Temperature Navy Applications ".  This option work is for 500J Capacitor Fabrication and Demonstration.  The modification fully funds Option II with $297,354 of funds, but only $105,953 of that amount is ARRA funds.  This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price contract because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).

<DESC>1.  Contracting Agency.  <br/>409th Contracting Support Brigade (409th CSB), Expeditionary Contracting Command-Europe, Wiesbaden Contracting Center<br/> <br/>2.  Nature and Description of the Action.  <br/>The action being requested is an approval for award without providing for full and open competition through award of a task order under the US Army's Computer Hardware, Enterprise Software and Solutions (CHESS) ITES-2S contract, W91QUZ-06-D-0012, on a sole source basis to provide continuation of information technology support services in support of the USAREUR Commander's enterprise computers, which are required to command and control U.S. Army Europe (USAREUR) forces. This request facilitates ensuring continuity of operations and the transition of services from the Air Force administered ICE 2 contract, F09603-03-D-0095-P00010, Task Order 6108, which will expire on June 30, 2010 before its planned full period of performance due to ceiling limitations, to a future competed contract task order, which is currently being developed in coordination between USAREUR and the 409th CSB. To ensure continuity of operations while a follow on competitive acquisition is being prepared, this proposed action encompasses the award of a sole source, Task Order for the period of 6 months to General Dynamics Information Technology (GDIT), who is currently the incumbent contractor providing these services. The estimated value of the proposed task order is $10.M and the performance period is limited to six months because the task order is needed to fill the gap between end of the current ICE2 contract vehicle (30 June 2010) and the start of a new three-year contract that will be competed. The anticipated award date for this new contract is 20 September 2010 with a performance commencement date of 1 January 2011, which will allow for a 90-day phase-in period. Army O&M FY10 funds will be used to fund this action. The estimated value, $10.0 M, includes a 6-month base and possible 6-month extension under FAR 52.217-8. <br/><br/>3.  Description of Supplies and Services. <br/>USAREUR's mission is to provide expeditionary force capabilities to fight the Global War on Terror, maintain NATO and other coalition partnerships, conduct security cooperation activities, train for and conduct joint and combined operations, and provide theater logistics support in order to achieve COCOM and national strategic objectives. USAREUR is a Major Army Command and is a component of U.S. European Command (EUCOM). <br/><br/>The Joint Coalition Information Systems (JCIS) Division is the Information Technology (IT) service provider to Headquarters, U.S. Army Europe (HQ USAREUR).  JCIS is comprised of over 100 military, civilian and contract personnel, managing over 300 servers, providing Full Spectrum IT support for HQ USAREUR, HQ IMCOM-E, and V Corps from the office to the battlefield.  JCIS is an arm of the European IT Enterprise and provides Service Desk numerous Enterprise services, to include SIPR Exchange Email, Enterprise SharePoint, the Global Army Resource Forest, consolidated public website hosting and Theater VIP support; and Site-S tenants included HQ U.S. Air Force Europe (USAFE), Product Manager Joint - Automatic Identification Technology (PM J-AIT), Department of the Army Inspector General (DAIG), Defense Health Information Management Systems (DHIMS),  European Regional Medical Command (ERMC), and 5th Signal Command.     <br/><br/>Headquarters USAREUR, Operation Communication Information Systems (OP CIS), Joint Coalition Information Systems (JCIS) Division provides Enterprise Information Technology (IT) services and support 24/7, 365 days a year to the HQ USAREUR 4-star General Officer Command and HQ Installation Management Command-Europe (IMCOM-E) activities.  The OP CIS, JCIS relies solely on the Air Force's ICE2 contract for its enterprise IT services. Technical IT support is provided by over 50 contractor employees to approximately 3500+ users in Heidelberg, GE and units engaged in fighting GWOT, HQs Army Transformation efforts, and ongoing mission such as the Joint Task Force - East. <br/><br/><br/>4. Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition. <br/>The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. Section 2304 (c)(1), as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(a)(ii) & (iii), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.<br/><br/>5.  Identification of the Justification Rationale. <br/>The US Army Europe was under the expectation that the Air Force's ICE 2 contract would continue through the full life span and complete its period of performance. Due to the notification by the Air Force contracting officer that the ICE 2 ceiling is approaching its allowable limit and the increase request had been denied, the contract that is currently servicing US Army Europe's requirements is no longer available past 30 June 2010. As a result, the Government has only been given a limited amount of time to transition to a newly developed contract task order. The Government has all intentions to fully compete these requirements and is requesting this sole source award as a bridging strategy for the additional 6 months needed to prepare a follow on competitive acquisition. In the long term, USARUER is preparing to merge these requirements together with the Theater C4I Contract, and award these requirements through competition under the new Theater War-Fighter C4I Contract Task Order anticipated to be awarded by October 1st, 2010. The C4I Contract Task Order is being developed in partnership between the IT Theater Business Office (IT-TBO) and the 409th CSB, and will provide for greater efficiencies and interoperability of War-Fighter IT systems throughout the theater of operations. <br/><br/>In accordance with FAR 6.302-1, there is only one responsible source capable of providing the continuous provisioning of these highly specialized IT services for a 6 month period.   Award under a competitive scenario to any other source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling of the agency's requirements, cause a break in services, and result in the creation of substantial costs that are duplicative and not likely to accepted by the new contractor, or recouped by the Government. <br/><br/>If an interim competitive contract was to be awarded for six months to any other source other then the incumbent contractor, the Government would bear the costs of contractor relocations (est. $42,500 per relocation) up to 4 times during this transition period including: once for the outgoing ICE2 contract, twice for the interim 6 month contract incoming and outgoing, and once for the final Theater War-Fighter C4I contract. This could result in up to $8.5M in duplicative costs, ($170,000 x 50 positions) within a period of 12 months for which the Government would not recoup these costs.  Even if the number of employees or the cost of relocation each of them varies over the next 6 months, the cost is still significant.<br/><br/>Additionally, the ability to transition information technology service contracts and contractor personnel in the OCONUS theater of operations is impacted highly by Host Nation laws and agreements, which specify the requirement for Technical Expert Status Agreement (TESA) approval. The continuation of these services, which are critical to the command and control of USAREUR forces is dependent on the transition from the ICE2 contract, which has been approved by the Host Nation for TESA, to an alternative contract task order that has not yet been reviewed by the Host Nation and would need to be awarded by NLT 30 March 2010 to allow for Host Nation TESA review and compliance in time for performance to begin on 1 July 2010. Therefore, any award under competitive means post 30 March 2010, would cause a break in services due to the contract and contractor personnel not being approved for TESA.  <br/><br/>Furthermore, the relocation of contractor personnel and 90 day in processing/out processing of incumbent and incoming contractors make the Sole Source solution the only viable acquisition strategy to fulfill this minimal period of performance requirement of 6 months.  A competitive contract action of 6 months to transition in another contractor will absorb180 days of performance time administratively and suspend performance for this effort resulting in unacceptable delays or break in services. <br/><br/>6.  Actions to Remove Barriers to Future Competition. <br/>The recently convened IPT has started the development of a performance specification that will support competition for the future acquisition of these IT services.<br/><br/>7.  Market Research . <br/>This effort was synopsized on 19 January 2010 on the Federal Business Opportunities website in accordance with the requirements for FAR 5.2.  To date, no responses have been received.  However, all responses that are received will be considered for future acquisitions of these services under the follow on competitive Theater War-Fighter C4I contract. <br/><br/>8. List of Interested Sources. <br/>No sources have expressed, in writing, an interest in this acquisition<br/><br/>9.  Any Other Facts Supporting the Justification.  <br/>Technical data packages, specifications, and a performance work statement suitable for full and open competition are being developed for the three-year contract that is planned to succeed the current ICE2 contract vehicle, but are not available as of yet. An Integrated Project Team (IPT) has been convened to develop the necessary pre-award documentation, and a Source Selection and Evaluation Board will be assembled once the Principal Assistant Responsible for Contracting (PARC) approves the Acquisition Plan for the competed acquisition. Federal Acquisition Regulation clause 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, will be included in the proposed task order, and the guidance outlined in PARC Policy #1 dated 13 January 2010 will be followed in the event that there is a need to extend services beyond 31 December 2010.<br/>

AGENCY IDENTIFICATION AND CONTRACTING ACTIVITYThe National Cemetery Administration (NCA), Centralized Contracting Division, has a need to approve a "Justification for Other Than Full and Open" requirement in accordance with FAR 6.3, Other Than Full and Open Competition.This urgent and compelling procurement action in accordance with IAW FAR 6.302-2 is based on the need to contract services to provide grave liner installation services at Marion National Cemetery, Marion IN under a new purchase order for one month, April 1 - 30, 2010 to prevent uninterrupted burial services.   2.	NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACQUISITION BEING APPROVEDApproval of a new purchase order is needed for the continuation of grave liner installation services from April 1, 2010 to April 30, 2010 at the Marion National Cemetery located at 1700 East 38th Street, Marion, IN  46952. This purchase order is needed to provide proper burials at Marion National Cemetery without any interruption in services.3.	DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES AND SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY'S NEEDSNCA has a need to contract all labor, materials and transportation necessary to fabricate, deliver and install Type I - Concrete Vaults, Style 1 - Box with separate Flat Lid at Marion National Cemetery. The concrete vaults must be Type-I, Style-I, Liner, Grave, Concrete. The Contractor must be able to keep pace with Burial and Grave Liner Installation activities of the Marion National Cemetery. The Contractor shall install the grave liner 30 minutes prior to burial services and will remain on site and in close proximity to NCA excavation crews until all grave liner covers are in place. Normally, several crews are used daily for excavations, which will result in grave liners being installed at different Sections of the cemetery.  Marion National Cemetery uses grave sites measuring 4' x 8' in new burial sections. This shall require exact preciseness in placement of all grave liners. The estimated value of the grave liner installation services from April 1 through April 30, 2010 is $8,370.00.4.	IDENTIFICATION OF STATUTORY AUTHORITY The requirement will be solicited under citation 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (2), 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (2) and FAR 6.302-2: Unusual and compelling urgency5.	DEMONSTRATION THAT THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR THE NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITEDThe proposed contractor, Marion Vault Works Inc., provides current grave liner installation services at Marion National Cemetery under Contract No.: VA610-P-0034, which expires on March 31, 2010.  The Government is currently in the process of soliciting the same requirement under Request for Proposals (RFP) No. VA-786-10-RP-0099, with a period of performance of one (1) base term (date of award to September 30, 2010) with four (4) option one-year periods ,if exercised by the Government.  The RFP was issued on March 9, 2010.  There was one (1) amendment to the RFP, resulting in a proposal due date of April 2, 2010.  A new contract against the RFP will not be awarded before the current contract's expiration date of March 31, 2010.  Graveliners are the outside concrete containers in which caskets are placed. Graveliners are used to reduce the amount of sinkage of the grave subsequent to the interment.  NCA provides graveliners and the installation services for all initial casketed interment at no cost to veterans and eligible dependents.  If NCA were not to have a graveliner installation services, then it will harm the Government in not being able to provide complete burial benefits to veterans and eligible dependents.  The requirement is essential to continue the installation of grave liners at Marion National Cemetery, to give our Nation's veterans dignified, timely memorial services. This type of continued service requires a local presence, understanding of the Cemetery's timely needs, and the ability to meet short notice requirements. The current contractor can provide the timely local presence to ensure this continuation of services until a new contract is awarded. Disruption in grave liner installation would result in delays to proper burials of our Nation's veterans.Therefore, a new purchase order is urgently needed so there is no lapse in grave liner installation services to provide the proper burials at Marion National Cemetery.6.	 A DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS PRACTIABLEAt this current time, it is not practicable to solicit offers for one month of services when the requirement for a base term with four one-year option periods are currently being solicited under RFP No.: VA-786-10-RP-0099.  The Government demonstrates the efforts of seeking potential sources by advertising RFP No.: VA-786-10-RP-0099 at www.fbo.gov. 7.	DEMONSTRATION THAT THE ANTICIPATED COST WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE The Government anticipates that the proposed cost will be fair and reasonable in accordance with FAR 15.404-1(b)(ii) and (v).8.	DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND THE RESULTS OR STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTEDDue to the urgent and compelling requirement to provide Marion National Cemetery with continued services for one month, market research was not conducted.There is not enough time to conduct adequate Market Research, solicit, and have a timely award by April 1, 2010.Market research in accordance with FAR 10 was conducted under the current solicitation, RFP No.: VA-786-10-RP-0099 for the same requirement.9.	OTHER FACTS SUPPORTINGIn accordance with FAR 6.303-2(iii), the nature of harm that would be brought to NCA is that if NCA does not have contracted graveliner installation services in place, it will harm the abilities of NCA to provide burial services to veterans and their dependents and bring humiliation to NCA's respected image.10.    CONTRACTING OFFICER'S CERTIFICATION"I certify that the facts and representations under my cognizance and which are included in this Justification and Approval are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief."      _________________________      Charisse James/es      Contracting Officer

DEMONSTRATION THAT THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR THE NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITEDThe proposed contractor, Laurcal Inc DBA Pacific West Labor Services, provides current headstone raise/realignment services at Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery under Contract No.: VA786-P-0117, which expires on March 31, 2010.  The Government is currently in the process of soliciting the same requirement under Request for Proposals (RFP) No. VA-786-10-RP-0100, with a period of performance one (1) base term (date of award to September 30, 2010) with four (4) option one-year periods , if exercised by the Government.  The RFP was issued on February 24, 2010.  There was one (1) amendment to the RFP, resulting in a proposal due date of April 2, 2010.  A new contract against the RFP will not be awarded before the current contract's expiration date of March 31, 2010. A headstone is a marker, normally carved from stone, placed over or next to the site of a burial in a cemetery.  Raise and realignment involves raising the headstone and realigning it to match other headstones in that row/section at the Cemetery, resulting in a consistent and quality appearance for the Cemetery.NCA provides headstones, raise, realignment, set, and installation services for all headstones at no cost to veterans and eligible dependents.  If NCA were not to have headstone raise/realignment services, then it will harm the Government in not being able to provide complete burial benefits to veterans and eligible dependents.  The requirement is essential to continue the raise/realignment of headstones at Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery, to give our Nation's veterans dignified, timely memorial services.

AGENCY IDENTIFICATION AND CONTRACTING ACTIVITYThe National Cemetery Administration (NCA), Centralized Contracting Division, has a need to approve a "Justification for Other Than Full and Open" requirement in accordance with FAR 6.3, Other Than Full and Open Competition.This urgent and compelling procurement action in accordance with IAW FAR 6.302-2 is based on the need to contract services to provide grounds maintenance services at Johnson's Island Confederate Stockade Cemetery, Lakeside Marblehead, OH under a new purchase order for April 1 - September 30, 2010 to prevent uninterrupted grounds maintenance services.   2.	NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACQUISITION BEING APPROVEDApproval of a new purchase order is needed for the continuation of grounds maintenance services from April 1, 2010 to September 30, 2010 at the Johnson's Island Confederate Stockade Cemetery, Lakeside Marblehead, OH 43440. This purchase order is needed to provide grounds maintenance services at the Cemetery without any interruption in services.3.	DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES AND SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY'S NEEDSNCA has a need to contract all labor, supervision, materials, supplies, tools, and equipment required to perform the work called for under this purchase order, including mowing, trimming, clean up, renovation of sunken graves, leaf collection, turf maintenance, headstone raise/realignment, and tree removal.The estimated value of the grounds maintenance services from April 1 through September 30, 2010 is $6,290.004.	IDENTIFICATION OF STATUTORY AUTHORITY The requirement will be solicited under citation 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (2), 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (2) and FAR 6.302-2: Unusual and compelling urgency5.	DEMONSTRATION THAT THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR THE NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITEDThe proposed contractor, Robert Hruska, provides current grounds maintenance services at Johnson's Island Confederate Stockade Cemetery under Purchase Order No.: 786-J05041, which expires on March 31, 2010.  If NCA were not to have continuation in grounds maintenance services, then it will harm the Government in not being able to provide complete burial benefits to veterans and eligible dependents.  The requirement is essential to continue the grounds maintenance services at the Cemetery, to give our Nation's veterans dignified, timely memorial services.

Disruption in grounds maintenance services would result in delays to proper burials of our Nation's veterans.Therefore, a new purchase order is urgently needed so there is no lapse in grounds maintenance services to provide the proper burials at Johnsons Island Confederate Stockade Cemetery.6.	 A DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS PRACTIABLEAt this current time, it is not practicable to solicit offers for six months of services due to the urgency to ensure continuation of grounds maintenance services. The Cemetery anticipates soliciting grounds maintenance services under a new solicitation and contract beyond September 30, 2010.7.	DEMONSTRATION THAT THE ANTICIPATED COST WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE A price analysis was conducted by comparing the unit prices the Government is currently paying under Purchase Order No. 786-J05041 for grounds maintenance services as Johnson Island Confederate Stockade Cemetery with the exception of two line items, Turf Maintenance - Fertilizer and Turf Maintenance - Herbicide).  The unit price for the two line items increased by 36%, because of the increase in turf supply costs.  Therefore, the Government anticipates that the proposed cost will be fair and reasonable in accordance with FAR 15.404-1(b)(ii) and (v).8.	DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND THE RESULTS OR STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTEDDue to the urgent and compelling requirement to provide Johnsons Island Confederate Stockade Cemetery with continued services for six months, market research was not conducted.There is not enough time to conduct adequate Market Research, solicit, and have a timely award by April 1, 2010, when the Cemetery needs continuation of grounds maintenances services.Market research in accordance with FAR 10 will be conducted as part of any solicitation issued beyond September 30, 2010.9.	OTHER FACTS SUPPORTINGIn accordance with FAR 6.303-2(iii), the nature of harm that would be brought to NCA is that if NCA does not have contracted grounds maintenance services in place, it will harm the abilities of NCA to provide burial services to veterans and their dependents and bring humiliation to NCA's respected image.10.
